services 

we operate the authoritative directory of andor the backend systems for all com net cc gov edu and name domain names among others our services allow individuals and organizations to establish their online identities while providing the secure alwayson access they need to communicate and transact reliably with largescale online audiences 

  

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” among others under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com agreement the us department of commerce “doc” we are also the exclusive registry of domain names within certain transliterations of com and net in a number of different native languages and scripts “idn gtlds” as a registry we maintain the authoritative directory of all secondlevel domain names eg examplecom and examplenet in these gtlds and idn gtlds our global constellation of dns servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain our shared registration system that allows icannaccredited registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into verisign operated central directories and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

in addition to our registry agreements with icann we have agreements to operate the registries for the tv and cc country code toplevel domains “cctlds” for tuvalu and cocos keeling islands respectively and to operate the technical systems for the gov and edu sponsored tlds these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of dns servers and shared registration system we did not participate in the tuvalu government’s rebid of the contract to operate tv  and we anticipate transitioning the operation of the tv registry during 2022 we will continue to operate tv until the transition 

  

we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access domain names in characters representing their local language our gtlds and cctlds can support standardscompliant domain name registrations in over 100 different native languages and scripts 

we also perform the root zone maintainer function under an agreement with icann for the core of the internet’s dns and operate two of the 13 root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the top of the dns hierarchy 

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years the fees charged for com  net and name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc and tv domain names and our idn gtlds are based on a similar fee system and registration system although the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those for  com  as established in the cooperative agreement and the  com registry agreement and for  net and  name  as established in those respective registry agreements the fees received from operating the  gov tld are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us government the fees from our performance of the technical operations for other tlds are based on the terms of verisign’s agreements with those respective registry operators  

  

operations infrastructure 

our operations infrastructure consists of secure data centers in dulles virginia ashburn virginia new castle delaware and fribourg switzerland as well as more than 100 other sites around the world our domain name servers refer requestors to the associated authoritative name servers for second level domains under our tlds thus enabling dns resolution for every com and net domain name on the internet and for domain names under a large number of other tlds our servers process hundreds of billions of queries daily our operations infrastructure operates 24 hours a day supporting the security integrity and availability of our services the performance and availability of our infrastructure are critical for our business key features of our operations infrastructure include 

  

• distributed servers we operate a large number of highspeed servers globally to support localized transaction volume and performance demands in conjunction with our proprietary software processes and procedures this global constellation of servers offers rapid failover global and local load balancing and threshold monitoring on critical servers 

  

• networking we deploy and maintain a redundant and diverse global network maintain highspeed redundant connections to numerous internet service providers and maintain peering relationships globally to ensure that our critical services are readily accessible to end users at all times 

  

• security we incorporate architectural concepts such as protected domains restricted nodes and distributed access control in our system architecture in addition we employ firewalls and intrusion detection software as well as proprietary security mechanisms at many points across our infrastructure we perform continuous internal vulnerability testing and periodic controls audits and also contract with thirdparty security organizations to perform periodic penetration tests and security risk assessments on our systems we have engineered resiliency and diversity into how we host classes of products throughout our set of interconnected sites to reduce the risk of unknown vendor defects and zeroday security vulnerabilities this includes different physical security silos which themselves are separated into bulkheads and in which servers are located corporate networks are in their own physical silo thus the corporate networks to which personnel directly connect are separated from the silos that house production services administration of production gear from corporate systems must go through internal fortified intermediaries and account credentials used within the corporate networks are not used within the production silos 

• data integrity we employ both phased and systemic integrity validation operations via a number of proprietary mechanisms on all internal dns publication operations 

  

we continuously expand our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to address projected internet attack trends 

  

call centers and service desk we provide customer support services over the phone by email and through webbased selfhelp systems our support teams are staffed with trained technical customer support agents support is available for customers 24 hours a day throughout the covid19 pandemic our support teams have continued servicing our customers while working remotely 

  

operations support and monitoring through our network operations center we have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical systems network and services our network operations center monitors our systems 24 hours a day and has continued to be staffed by employees working remotely during the covid19 pandemic 

  

disaster recovery plans we have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities we maintain data centers with mirrored services that allow failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity as well as a tertiary facility in switzerland our critical data services including domain name registration and global resolution use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as synchronous mirroring and remote replication we periodically operate services at an alternate data center during maintenance windows to ensure the availability of our data centers for disaster recovery 

marketing sales and distribution 

we seek to expand our business through focused marketing campaigns and programs that target growth in the com and net domain name base both domestically and in foreign markets we provide tools to be used by both registrars and end users to enable them to find relevant domain names we have marketing and sales offices in several countries around the world 

research and development 

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and new and enhanced ways to ensure the security stability and resiliency of our services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace 

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by ongoing technological developments shifting channel dynamics frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and the continued evolution of security threats will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services and to introduce both new and enhanced products and services 

competition   

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration in addition to the gtld and cctld registries we operate or for which we provide backend registry services there are over 1100 other operational gtld registries over 250 ascii cctld registries more than 50 idn cctld registries and over 90 idn gtld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and other gtlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage among our competitors operating gtld and cctld registries are china internet network information center cnnic denic nominet public interest registry pir donuts godaddy and radix 

to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation via domain names or transact on ecommerce platforms we face competition from search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu social media networks such as facebook and wechat ecommerce platforms such as amazon ebay and taobao and microblogging tools such as twitter in addition we face competition from these social media and ecommerce platforms if they are used by businesses and individuals to establish an online presence rather than through the use of a domain name 

furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of mobile applications to locate and access content we face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure our industry is characterized by collaborative relationships involving our competitors in the past certain of our competitors have consolidated our ability to participate and benefit from such collaborative arrangements or consolidations may be limited and such collaborative arrangements and consolidations could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our business 

industry regulation 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations icann plays a central coordination role in this bottomup multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit icann’s multistakeholder policy development processes have created and will continue to create policies programs and standards that directly or indirectly impact our business certain policies can be adopted as consensus or temporary policies which we are obligated to follow under our agreements with icann for example in response to the general data protection regulation icann issued a temporary policy modifying public access to information from the whois services delivered by registrars and registries 

we are also subject to countrylevel laws and regulations in the united states and in international locations in china we are required to maintain licenses for  com  net tv and cc under regulations issued by the ministry of industry and information technology the licenses for com and net must be renewed in 2022 additionally in many jurisdictions in which we operate including california the european union the united kingdom china and elsewhere strict new data security and data privacy regulations have been or are being adopted because we do not possess extensive personal information we have not yet experienced significant impacts from these regulations however compliance costs and other business impacts could become significant if we begin to receive personal registrant information in our  com and  net tlds and as regulatory enforcement increases as courts interpret these regulations and as new laws and regulations continue to be adopted other regulations or changes to regulations may also impact our business operations including changes to the digital services act or network and information security directive in the european union or the communications decency act in the united states 

com toplevel domain 

our operation of the  com tld is subject to the terms of a registry agreement with icann as amended the “ com registry agreement” the current term of the com registry agreement is six years and must be renewed or extended by november 30 2024 although the com registry agreement contains a “presumptive” right of renewal icann could terminate or refuse to renew the registry agreement see “risk factors  any loss or modification of our right to operate the  com and  net gtlds could have a material adverse impact on our business and result in loss of revenues” in part i item 1a of this form 10k for further information 

other significant terms within the  com registry agreement include performance specifications and service level agreements for the availability of our dns resolution services our shared registration system and our whois services the  com registry agreement contains marketing limitations including limitations on our ability to bundle products and the manner in which we provide marketing support to icannaccredited registrars we are also required under the  com registry agreement to provide icannaccredited registrars with access to our systems to register or take other actions related to domain names in order to introduce new registry services or make material changes to existing registry services we must follow prescribed procedures which permit icann to review and approve such services 

the com registry agreement requires that on a quarterly basis we pay 025 to icann for each annual term of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter amendment 3 to the  com registry agreement permits an increase to the maximum price as defined in the com registry agreement of com domain name registrations by up to 7 over the previous year in each of the final four years of each sixyear period the first such sixyear period began on october 26 2018 amendment 3 also clarified that the restrictions in the com registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the com tld and also clarified that our ability to increase prices by 7 over the previous year due to new icann consensus policies or documented extraordinary expense may occur only in years where we do not otherwise take the price increases described above 

our operation of the  com tld is also subject to the terms of a cooperative agreement with the doc the cooperative agreement has undergone various amendments with the most recent amendment 35 on october 26 2018 amendment 35 extended the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 which will automatically renew on the same terms for successive sixyear terms unless the doc provides written notice of nonrenewal 120 days prior to the end of the thencurrent term 

amendment 35 includes the doc’s consent to the modification of the pricing terms in the  com registry agreement as described above the cooperative agreement further provides that we shall be entitled at any time during the term of the com registry agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the com registry agreement if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the com registry agreement as determined by the doc 

doc approval of changes to or the renewal of the  com registry agreement was limited by amendment 35 to only the following circumstances 1 changes to the pricing provisions other than as approved in amendment 35 2 changes to the vertical integration provisions other than the clarification approved in amendment 35 3 changes to the security stability and resiliency posture as reflected in the functional or performance specifications including the service level agreements 4 changes to the conditions for renewal or termination of the com registry agreement or 5 changes to the whois service except as mandated by icann through temporary or consensus policies as was the case with prior amendments amendment 35 is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on the company with respect to the  com registry agreement 

finally amendment 35 clarified that the restrictions in the com registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the  com tld as to the  com tld we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar that sells  com domain names in addition under amendment 35 we have agreed to continue to operate the  com tld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of contentneutral policies for the operation of the dns 

net toplevel domain 

our operation of the  net tld is subject to the terms of a registry agreement with icann as amended the “ net registry agreement” the current term of this agreement is six years and must be renewed or extended by july 1 2023 the terms of the  net registry agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the  com registry agreement except that we are entitled to raise the annual price for new and renewal  net domain name registrations by 10 each year

 item 1a   risk factors 

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize our business operating results financial condition reputation cash flows or prospects can be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition reputation cash flows and prospects actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below 

cybersecurity and technology risk factors 

attempted security breaches including from the exploitation of vulnerabilities cyberattacks and distributed denial of service “ddos” attacks against our systems and services increase our costs expose us to potentially material liability and could materially harm our business and reputation 

as an operator of critical internet infrastructure we experience a high rate of cyberattacks and attempted security breaches targeting our systems and services including the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat attacks exploitation of zeroday vulnerabilities ransomware attacks and social engineering attacks the forms of these attacks are constantly evolving and may involve methods tools and strategies that may not have been previously identified and may not have been observed until the moment of launch or until sometime after making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against in addition to external threats our systems and services are subject to insider threat risks including physical or electronic breakins sabotage and risks from suppliers such as consultants and advisors saas providers hardware software and network systems manufacturers regional internet registries and other vendors or from current or former contractors or employees these threats and any resulting security breaches can arise from intentional or unintentional actions our continued exposure to these threats and the potential that they could lead to material liability claims against us requires us to expend significant financial and other resources we have developed policies procedures and standards to identify protect detect respond and recover from threats posed by cybersecurity risks and failure to comply with these policies procedures and standards by our employees or suppliers could limit our ability to effectively manage threats from these cybersecurity risks in addition we must ensure that our employees stay focused on cybersecurity threats especially in remote or hybrid work environment including during the covid19 pandemic or our ability to effectively manage cybersecurity risks could be impacted our failure to effectively manage these security risks including insider threats could result in material harm to our business including loss of or delay in revenues failure to meet contracted service level obligations material liability claims failure to maintain market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs and could call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

security vulnerabilities in our systems and our vendors’ systems including vulnerabilities in third party software and hardware pose a material risk to our operations we use externallydeveloped technology systems and services including both hardware and software for a variety of purposes including compute storage encryption and authentication backoffice support and other functions we have developed policies procedures and standards to reduce the impact of security vulnerabilities in system components as well as at any vendors where our data is stored or processed however such measures cannot provide absolute security while we strive to remediate known vulnerabilities on a timely basis such vulnerabilities could be exploited before our remediation is effective and if so could cause systems and service interruptions data loss and other damages our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security vulnerabilities including any potential failure to timely replace and upgrade hardware software or other technology assets could result in material harm to our business including loss of or delay in revenues failure to meet contracted service level obligations material liability claims failure to maintain market acceptance injury to our reputation increased costs and call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

in addition our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks recent industry experience has demonstrated that ddos attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication and have the ability to widely disrupt internet services in recent years the size of ddos attacks has grown rapidly we have successfully mitigated ddos attacks during this time frame that are significantly larger than those we have historically experienced while we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against ddos attacks there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any attack even if only partially successful could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our service level obligations and generally impede our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community we have historically incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to enable our infrastructure to process levels of attack traffic that are significant multiples of our normal transaction volume we are employing new technologies and new and different 

services and capabilities to help mitigate ddos attacks if these new technologies services and capabilities are not effective our networks could be disrupted our response times could increase our ability to meet our contracted service level obligations could be negatively impacted and our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community could be impeded 

we do not maintain specific reserves for security breaches cyberattacks and ddos attacks against our systems and the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to such attacks 

we may introduce undetected or unknown defects into our systems or services which could materially harm our business and harm our vendors or our customers 

despite testing services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors which could result in service outages or disruptions compromised customer data including dns data diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs performance of our services whether or not defective could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered on internet users and consumers and on thirdparty applications and services that use our services any of which could result in legal claims against us while we strive to prevent detect and remediate defects or errors they can and do occur and they could result in our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner failure to meet our contracted service level obligations injury to our reputation and increased costs 

our infrastructure and services are subject to vulnerabilities in the global routing system for the internet as well as risks arising from internet services providers’ increasing adoption of the resource public key infrastructure system 

routing on the internet depends on the border gateway protocol “bgp” which is a protocol that relies on networks within the internet infrastructure acting in a trustworthy manner when sharing information about destinations for connectivity and the routing of internet traffic as a trustbased protocol bgp has a number of vulnerabilities that may lead to outages or disrupt our services including as a result of “route hijacks” that involve accidental or malicious rerouting of internet traffic or “route leaks” that involve the malicious or unintentional propagation of routing information beyond the intended scope of the originator receiver andor one of the networks along the route’s path both route hijacks and route leaks can result in partial or full rerouting of internet traffic for the impacted destinations these types of events which are generally beyond our control could enable an array of attack conditions or service disruptions and could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the public’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

to address internet routing system vulnerabilities many internet service providers are beginning to adopt and apply internet reachability policies based on a system known as the resource public key infrastructure “rpki” operated by the regional internet registries “rirs” the rirs allocate internet number resources such as internet protocol addresses to enterprises and network operators we have limited visibility into the maturity of and investment in the rirs’ operational and security controls which are outside of our control when the availability integrity or confidentiality of any of the information in the rpki system or systems used to maintain and administer rpki data and systems are impacted or otherwise compromised in any of the rirs or any network operator that is a relying party of the rpki system or the operations or ingestion of data from the rpki system are otherwise impacted by a known or unknown vulnerability our services may be negatively impacted such impacts may include degraded or full loss of reachability of service addresses in the global internet routing system resulting in degradation or complete loss of availability of our services a compromise of the rpki system and related services or unintentional or unauthorized manipulation of data therein may also result in other denial of service attack conditions for our infrastructure and services the systemic dependencies introduced by rpki and the relying parties of the rpki system including network service providers are outside of our control and systems that depend upon the rpki may be only as secure as the weakest elements of the rpki system we may contract with one or more rirs to employ rpki which carries material operational risks as described above as well as material contractual risks which may expose us to service disruptions and material liability 

we could encounter system interruptions or systems failures resulting from activities beyond our direct control that could materially harm our business 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures damage or interruption caused by fire earthquake and other natural disasters intentional acts of vandalism terrorist attacks unintentional mistakes or errors our systems and operations also face risks inherent in or arising from the terms and conditions of our agreements with service providers to operate our networks and data centers we are also subject to state suppression of internet operations any of these problems or outages could create potential liability and exposure including from a failure to meet our contracted service level obligations and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

our data centers our data center systems including the shared registration systems located at our data centers and our resolution systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption which could impede our ability to provide our services expose us to material liability and materially harm our reputation 

most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our owned data centers in 2019 we began expanding some of our data center services to a leased data center facility these data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption including from natural disasters such as fires earthquakes hurricanes and floods power loss hardware or system failures physical or electronic breakins human error or interference we are also updating our network architecture in several of our new and existing data centers if our data center facilities or the updated network architecture do not operate as expected including the ability to quickly switch over between sites we could experience service interruptions or outages a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register or manage domain names for a period of time if such a registrar has not implemented robust services in a manner that preserves transactions until processed by the registry then the failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could also impact our ability to provide uptodate information in our resolution systems which could result in breaches of our service level obligations pertaining to our resolution services and impact the resolution of domain names on the internet although we carry insurance we do not carry insurance or designated financial reserves for such interruptions 

in addition our services depend on the secure and efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the secure and efficient operation of internet service providers internet exchange point operators and internet backbone service providers such providers have encountered periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control and may continue to encounter problems and outages or may choose to discontinue their service if the providers that our connections depend upon do not protect maintain improve and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the dns through their networks our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation or update of the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers or the tld zone files that we operate including for example the  gov registry or other network functions could result in among other problems 1 a dns resolution or other service outage or degradation 2 the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet 3 the deletion of one or more secondlevel domain names from the internet or 4 a misdirection of one or more domain names to different servers a failure in the operation or update of the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could result in similar consequences any of these problems or outages could create potential material liability and exposure from litigation and investigations could result in a failure to meet our service level agreements and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business these problems could also result in adverse publicity decrease the public’s trust in the security of ecommerce or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

we retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information we retain or that is retained in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face material liability and exposure from litigation and investigations fail to meet contracted service level obligations or be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for operation of our businesses and customers could be reluctant to use our services any of which could also adversely affect our reputation and harm our business or cause financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance 

we face risks from the operation of the root server system and our performance of the root zone maintainer functions under the rzma 

although the overall root server system is redundant and dispersed a failure or interruption in the operation of the root server system could impact the effectiveness of our  com and  net authoritative servers and therefore negatively impact directory services necessary for the operation of the internet we also have an important operational role in support of a key internet assigned numbers authority “iana” function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative root zone data and make it available to all root server operators under the rzma with icann if we make errors in the publication of the root zone we may be subject to material claims challenging the rzma or our performance under it including tort claims and we may not have immunity from or sufficient indemnification or insurance for such claims 

contractual regulatory legal and compliance risk factors 

any loss or modification of our right to operate the  com and  net gtlds could have a material adverse impact on our business and result in loss of revenues 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operation of the  com gtld under our cooperative agreement with the doc and our  com registry agreement as well as our operation of the  net gtld under our net registry agreement any loss or modification of our right to operate the  com and  net gtlds could materially and adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and result in loss of revenues our  com and  net registry agreements contain “presumptive” rights of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms on november 30 2024 and june 30 2023 respectively icann could refuse to renew upon expiration or terminate our  com registry agreement or our  net registry agreement if upon proper notice 1 we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and 2 we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court additionally each of the com and net registry agreements provide that if certain terms of these agreements are not similar to such terms generally in effect in the registry agreements of the five largest gtlds then a renewal of these agreements would be upon terms reasonably necessary to render such terms to be similar to the registry agreements for those other gtlds any such terms if they apply could be unfavorable to us and have a material adverse impact on our business 

standard renewals of the  com registry agreement do not require further doc approval although the prior written approval of the doc is required for the removal of or any changes to the pricing section other than as approved in amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement and for changes to certain other specified terms whether such removal or changes is made at a renewal or otherwise we can provide no assurances that doc approval would be provided upon our request for any of these changes 

in addition under amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement we have agreed to continue to operate the  com gtld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of contentneutral policies for the operation of the dns and under our binding letter of intent with icann we have agreed to work with the icann community to develop certain best practices and other commitments for the security stability and resiliency of the dns and the internet such policies and processes could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

changes or challenges to the pricing provisions in the com registry agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business 

under the terms of the com registry agreement we may increase the annual fee of each com domain name registration or renewal by up to 7 over the previous year in each of the final four years of each sixyear period we can provide no assurance that we will exercise such right to increase the annual fee in addition to this contractual right we are entitled to increase the annual fee of each com domain name registration or renewal by up to 7 due to the imposition of any new specifications or policies adopted by icann pursuant to the procedures set forth in its bylaws and due process “consensus policies” or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the dns an “extraordinary expense” in addition our ability to increase the price for com domain name registrations and renewals due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense may occur only in years in which we do not increase the price for com domain name registrations and renewals as described above it is uncertain whether circumstances would arise that would permit us to take a price increase due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense or if they do whether we would seek to increase the price for com domain name registrations for this reason a failure to seek and obtain a price increase due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense when available could negatively affect our operating results we also have the right under the cooperative agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions on the com tld if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant these restrictions however it is uncertain whether we will seek the removal of these restrictions or whether the doc would approve the removal of these restrictions 

our com registry agreement including its pricing provisions has faced and could face in the future challenges including possible legal challenges or challenges under icann’s accountability mechanisms from icann registrars registrants and others and any adverse outcome from these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business 

government regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and internationally may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential material liability and have a material adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or internationally to the internet or the domain name industry have imposed and may in the future impose new costs and new restrictions on our business laws and regulations including those designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names or to require registrants to provide additional documentation to register domain names have and may in the future impose significant additional costs on our business and subject us to additional liabilities or could prevent us from operating in certain jurisdictions for example the 

government of china has indicated that it will issue and has issued new regulations and has begun to enforce existing regulations that impose additional costs on and risks to our provision of registry services in china and could impact the demand for domain name registrations in china registries including us and chinabased registrars are also required by some of these regulations to obtain a governmentissued license for each tld operating in china any failure to obtain or renew the required licenses or to comply with any license requirements or any updates thereto by us or our chinabased registrars could impact our current and future business in china 

in addition laws have been and may in the future be adopted that are designed to restrict counterfeit or illegal goods or intellectual property violations such as cybersquatting prevent online abuse increase access to registrant personal information or that restrict the transfer of data the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current locations expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

similarly the european union’s general data protection regulation which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds broad new requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and significant penalties became effective in may 2018 other countries such as china and other states such as california with the california consumer privacy act have enacted or are enacting data protection laws regulating or limiting the collection storage and processing of personal data as well as granting new rights to data subjects to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and receive data originating from different jurisdictions and consequently we are subject to these continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws and regulations that are applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to international laws and regulations these evolving legal regulatory and compliance frameworks could impose significant costs for us that are likely to increase over time 

our international operations expose us and our business to additional economic legal regulatory and political risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and business 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the us our business operations in international locations have required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular location and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international locations or expand our presence in existing locations failure to do so could materially harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

• competition with companies in international locations or other domestic companies entering international locations in which we operate as well as local governments actively promoting cctlds that we do not operate 

• political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies andor the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” of the us department of the treasury 

• tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• potential problems associated with adapting our services to technical conditions existing in different countries 

• difficulties in verifying enduser information including for the purposes of complying with the verification requirements of certain countries and with the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by ofac 

• more stringent privacy and data localization policies in some international jurisdictions 

• additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting us interests abroad 

• potentially conflicting or adverse tax consequences 

• reliance on third parties in international locations in which we only recently started doing business and 

• potential concerns of international governments or customers and prospects regarding doing business with us technology companies due to alleged us government data collection policies 

escalating political tensions between the united states and china in particular may pose additional risks to our business in china since 2018 the united states and china have imposed tariffs on certain of each other’s exports in 2020 and 2021 the us government announced restrictions on trading with certain chinese companies the chinese government subsequently announced actions that if implemented could impose additional restrictions on the chinese operations of nonchinese companies these and future government actions impacting our ability to operate in china may cause our management’s attention to be diverted our reputation to be damaged or our business in china to be adversely affected 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may materially and adversely affect our income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous international jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis because of a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure changes in tax laws that could adversely impact our income or nonincome taxes or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

in the us a number of legislative proposals including the “build back better” bill are being considered which could impact how multinational corporations are taxed in addition the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” plans to issue guidance and a final report that will provide a longterm multilateral proposal on the taxation of the digital economy similarly some international tax jurisdictions independent of the oecd have enacted or may enact new tax regimes aimed at income resulting from digital services although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such changes or the likelihood of such legislative proposals being adopted in the us or throughout the world any or all of these changes in tax laws could increase our taxes and adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow 

our business faces risks arising from icann’s consensus and temporary policies technical standards and other processes 

our registry agreements with icann require us to implement consensus policies and changes mandated by icann through temporary specifications or policies “temporary policies” icann could adopt consensus policies or temporary policies that 1 are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of com  net and other gtlds that we operate 2 are inconsistent with our current or future plans 3 impose substantial costs on our business 4 subject the company to additional legal risks or 5 affect our competitive position these consensus policies or temporary policies could have a material adverse effect on our business for example icann has adopted a consensus policy that would require us to receive and display registrants’ personal and contact information and designated administrative and technical contact information “thick whois data” for com and  net  although that policy is undergoing modification by a subsequent consensus policy that may make such transfer of thick whois data to us optional we can provide no assurances that such a modification will occur or that we would not choose to or ultimately be required to receive and display thick whois data for our  com and  net registries the costs of complying or failing to comply with consensus and temporary policies particularly the cost of compliance if the  com and  net registries receive thick whois data could expose us to substantial compliance costs liability and exposure and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

our registry agreements with icann require us to implement and comply with various technical standards and specifications published by the internet engineering task force “ietf” icann could impose requirements on us through changes to these ietf standards or new standards that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position any such changes to the ietf standards or new standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

weakening of or changes to the multistakeholder form of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations if icann fails to uphold or if the multistakeholder model is significantly redefined it could harm our business for example certain governments governmental organizations and private actors continue to express dissatisfaction with the multistakeholder form of internet governance and have proposed alternatives including oversight by the united nations or by international treaties furthermore national legislation has been proposed on topics such as information security and access to personal information that effectively supplants the multistakeholder process for policy development in the dns substantially weakening or replacing the multistakeholder form of internet governance could materially harm our business 

in addition in 2016 the us government transferred key internet functions to icann who adopted new and enhanced accountability mechanisms in its bylaws such as the creation of the empowered community there can be no assurance that the removal of the us government oversight of these key functions or the changes to icann’s bylaws will not negatively impact our business 

claims lawsuits audits or investigations in which we are or could become involved may result in material adverse outcomes to our business 

we are and may in the future become involved in claims lawsuits audits and investigations including intellectual property litigation and infringement claims litigation is inherently unpredictable and unexpected judgments or excessive verdicts do occur in addition proceedings that we initially view as immaterial could prove to be material adverse outcomes in lawsuits audits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example we are engaged in activities to help mitigate security threats and other forms of dns abuse in our tlds and we are involved in community efforts that could increase and expand such activities including potential new contractual obligations such activities include for example receiving reports of suspected threats and abuse from appropriate “trusted notifiers” typically involving national and international law enforcement and notifying registrars or others of domain names associated with suspected malicious or illegal activity our activities may also include disabling one or more domain names in the tlds we operate including in response to governmental directives and orders in those jurisdictions in which we operate activities such as these have resulted in and could in the future result in significant litigation and could harm our reputation given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such claims lawsuits audits and investigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

strategic business and operating risk factors 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted how we operate our business and the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will materially impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain 

the united states and the global community we serve are facing unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic the pandemic and the preventative measures taken in response to the pandemic including “shelterinplace” or “stayathome” and similar orders issued by international federal state or local authorities and the subsequent relaxation and reimposition of such orders have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in significant volatility business and economic disruptions and uncertainty in response to the pandemic we have taken steps to protect our employees including arranging for most of our employees to work remotely while we continue to operate all of our services including our registry services for com and net and our root operations however the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will continue to impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to control or predict including 

• the duration and scope of the pandemic 

• the extent and effectiveness of responsive actions including the relaxation and reimposition of orders by authorities and the delivery and administration of vaccines including vaccination requirements and mandates by government regulation and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers and vendors 

• the impact of the pandemic on our key personnel and other employees including the impact of workfromhome arrangements on employee productivity and morale 

• the extent to which we are able to maintain and replace critical internet infrastructure components when necessary 

• our continued ability to execute on business continuity plans for the maintenance of our critical internet infrastructure while most of our employees continue to work remotely and 

• any negative impact on the demand for new and renewal domain name registrations resulting from the economic disruption caused by the pandemic and responses thereto 

further the impact of covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors any of which could have a material effect on us as of the date of this form 10k our financial condition and results of operations have not been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic regardless t his situation is uncertain and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider present material risks to our operations i f we are unable to successfully respond to and manage the impact of the pandemic and the resulting responses to it our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted and the impact could be material 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer material adverse impact to our business including lower demand for our products reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

we face competition from services that provide an online identity or presence including other gtld and cctld registries in order to remain competitive and retain our market position we must continually demonstrate the safety security and resiliency of our services and must adopt and support new technologies to adapt our services to changing technologies market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices if we do not successfully evolve and demonstrate the value of our services we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and such competitive pressures could materially harm our business in addition competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete finally consolidation within our industry has occurred and is likely to continue to occur our ability to participate and benefit from such consolidations may be limited and consolidation within our industry among our competitors could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our business 

we have been designated as the registry operator for certain new gtlds including certain idn gtlds our new gtlds may not be as or more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors in addition our new gtlds may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges and it is possible that resolution of domain names within some of these new gtlds may be blocked within certain state or organizational environments challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability 

see the “competition” section in part i item 1 of this form 10k for further information 

the evolution of technologies or internet practices and behaviors the adoption of substitute technologies or wholesale price increases of domain names in our tlds may materially and negatively impact the demand for the domain names for which we are the registry operator 

technologies relating to online presence including social media mobile devices apps and search engines have evolved and continue to evolve changing the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses these ongoing changes can negatively impact the demand for our domain names in addition registrants purchase domain names for a variety of reasons including personal commercial and investment reasons changes in the motivation of domain name registrants can negatively impact our business 

technology changes to web browser or internet search technologies could reduce demand for domain names similarly if internet users’ preferences or practices shift away from recognizing and relying on web addresses or if internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content demand for domain names in our tlds could be negatively impacted demand for domain names in our tlds could be negatively impacted by new technologies that significantly decrease the use of traditional domain names to present and protect an online identity new technologies that encourage internet users to expand the use of thirdlevel domains or alternate identifiers such as identifiers from social networking ecommerce platforms and microblogging sites could also negatively impact the demand for domain names in our tlds in addition the demand for domain names in our tlds could be impacted by alternative namespaces with domainnamelike identifiers that are operated outside the single authoritative dns root zone including for example blockchain namespaces to the extent that web browsers applications dns registrars and dns resolvers recognize and support such namespaces and that internet users are able to perform online operations with identifiers from such namespaces demand for domain names in tlds in the single authoritative dns root zone including our tlds could be negatively impacted 

some registrars and registrants purchase and resell domain names at an increased price adverse changes in the resale value of domain names changes in the business models for such domain name registrars and registrants or other factors 

including regulations limiting the resale of domain names could result in a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for domain names in our tlds 

some registrars and registrants seek to generate revenues by registering domain names specifically for website advertising changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google baidu and bing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market for domain names used for this purpose which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for such domain names in addition if spending on online advertising and marketing is reduced this may result in a further decline in the demand for domain names used for this purpose 

under the terms of the com and net registry agreements as amended we are permitted to increase the annual fee of each com and net domain name registration or renewal according to the provisions in these agreements to the extent we increase our prices there could be a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for com or net domain names 

if we fail to expand our services into developing and emerging economies in international locations our business may not grow 

we seek to serve many new developing and emerging economies in international locations to grow our business these economies are rapidly evolving and may not grow or even if they do grow our services may not be widely used or accepted there accordingly the demand for our services in these locations is uncertain factors that may affect acceptance or adoption of our services in these locations include 

• regional internet infrastructure development expansion penetration and adoption and the development maturity and depth of our sales channels 

• acceptance and adoption of substitute products and services that enable online presence without a domain name including social media ecommerce platforms website builders and mobile applications 

• increased acceptance and adoption of other substitute products and services including cctlds or other gtlds 

• public perception of the security of our technologies and of ip and other networks 

• the introduction and consumer acceptance of new generations of mobile devices and in particular the use of mobile applications as the primary engagement mechanism for navigating the internet and 

• government regulations affecting the internet internet access and availability domain name registrations or the provision of registry services data security privacy or data localization ecommerce or telecommunications 

if our services are not widely accepted or adopted in these locations our business may not grow 

our business depends on registrars and their resellers maintaining their focus on marketing our products and services 

all of the domain name registrations and renewals for the registries we operate occur through registrars registrars and their resellers engage in substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names as well as their own associated offerings consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers including vertical integration by registrar or reseller industry participants could result in significant changes to their businesses operating models and cost structures these changes could include reduced marketing efforts for our tlds or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for the domain names for which we are the registry operator 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars and resellers have chosen to and may continue to choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms our registrars and resellers sell domain name registrations of other competing registries including new gtlds and some also sell and support their own services for websites such as email website hosting and other services our registrars and resellers may be more motivated to sell to registrants to whom they can also market their own services to the extent that registrars and resellers focus more on selling and supporting their services and less on the registration and renewal of domain names in our tlds our revenues could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully market our services to and build and maintain strong relationships with new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent if we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling registrations of domain names in our tlds as opposed to other competing tlds including the new gtlds or their own services our business could be harmed 

we depend on highly skilled employees to maintain and provide innovative solutions for our business and our business could be materially harmed if we are not able to attract and retain such qualified talent 

our business is highly technical and requires individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique technologies configurations operating systems and software development tools we depend on the knowledge experience and performance of these employees and leaders to effectively manage and provide innovative solutions for our business for example we require employees with expertise in dns operations and with certain cybersecurity specialties because such employees are in high demand by our competitors and other companies we must be able to attract integrate retain and motivate such highly skilled employees and leaders in addition we must effectively manage our transition to a postpandemic work environment to attract and retain these employees to meet our business needs failure to attract and retain such employees and to effectively implement succession plans for these employees could harm our business 

intellectual property risk factors 

we rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could materially harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of other countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the ietf to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” in some cases we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

we also license externally developed technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions these externally developed technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our services launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are or may become equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate verisign in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously disclosed afilias domains no 3 limited now called altanovo domains limited  “afilias” a competitor and losing bidder in the web auction filed a form of arbitration proceeding against icann an independent review process “irp” under icann’s bylaws on november 14 2018 afilias alleges that the agreement between verisign and nu dotco llc “ndc” pertaining to web violated icann’s new gtld applicant guidebook as a result afilias claims that icann had a duty to disqualify ndc’s bid and award the web gtld to afilias afilias also claims that icann would violate its bylaws pertaining to competition by awarding the web gtld to verisign afilias amended its irp request on march 21 2019 in part to oppose verisign’s and ndc’s participation in the irp a hearing was held on verisign’s and ndc’s applications for participation and on february 12 2020 the irp panel permitted verisign and ndc to participate in aspects of the irp in early august 2020 the irp panel held a hearing on afilias’ claims 

the irp panel issued its final decision on may 20 2021 consistent with verisign’s position the irp panel dismissed afilias’ claims for relief seeking to invalidate the web auction and to award the web tld to afilias concluding that such issues were beyond the irp panel’s jurisdiction furthermore as expected the irp panel’s ruling recommended that icann’s board of directors consider the objections made regarding the web auction and then make a decision on the delegation of web  with respect to icann the final decision said that certain actions andor inaction by icann in response to afilias’ objections did violate aspects of icanns bylaws related to transparency and fairness 

on june 19 2021 afilias filed an application to the irp panel requesting that it interpret certain terms of and make certain amendments to the final decision the irp panel denied that application in its entirety on december 21 2021 finding that it was “frivolous” and sanctioning afilias by directing it to pay icann’s attorney fees on january 16 2022 icann’s board directed its board accountability mechanisms committee to review the irp panel’s final decision and to provide the board with its findings to consider and act upon regarding the award and delegation of web

covid19 update 

the united states and the global community we serve are facing unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic in response to the pandemic we have established a task force to monitor the pandemic and have taken a number of actions to protect our employees including restricting travel modifying our sick leave policy to encourage quarantine and isolation when warranted and directing most of our employees to work from home we have implemented our readiness plans which include the ability to maintain critical internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely we believe that the effects of the pandemic to date have led to an increase in the demand for domain names particularly as businesses and entrepreneurs have been seeking to establish or expand their presence online in response to the pandemic our revenues continued to grow during 2020 and 2021 primarily driven by an increase in the domain name base for the com tld however the situation remains uncertain and hard to predict the broader implications of the pandemic on our business and operations and our financial results including the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact future growth in the domain name base remain uncertain the duration and severity of the economic disruptions from the pandemic may ultimately result in negative impacts on our business and operations results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and capital and financial resources for further discussion see “risk factors – the effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted how we operate our business and the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  income taxes 

we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and internationally tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions are complex interrelated and periodically changing significant judgment or interpretation of these laws and regulations is often required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes including for example the calculations of taxable income in each jurisdiction deferred taxes and the availability and amount of deductions and tax credits 

the final taxes payable are also dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from various tax examinations we only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions and tax benefit amounts that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in an outcome that is materially different from our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits see note 10 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of the 1655 million 

deferred tax asset and corresponding income tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the 2042 million income tax benefit recognized in 2020 as a result of the remeasurement of certain previously unrecognized income tax benefits 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

our revenues are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds and from providing backend registry services to a number of tld registry operators all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered in the com and net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is determined pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with registrars or their resellers and the registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars we also offer promotional incentivebased discount programs to registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate 

on october 26 2018 verisign and the doc amended the cooperative agreement the amendment among other items extends the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 and permits the price of a com domain name to be increased subject to appropriate changes to the com registry agreement without further doc approval by up to 7 in each of the final four years of each sixyear period beginning on october 26 2018 on march 27 2020 verisign and icann agreed to an amendment to the com registry agreement that among other items incorporates these changes agreed to with the doc to the pricing terms effective september 1 2021 we increased the annual registrylevel wholesale fee for each new and renewal  com domain name registration from 785 to 839 on february 10 2022 we announced that we will increase the annual registrylevel wholesale fee for each new and renewal com domain name registration from 839 to 897 effective september 1 2022 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our agreement with icann through june 30 2023 all fees paid to us for com and net registrations are in us dollars 

a comparison of revenues is presented below 



the following table compares the  com and net domain name registrations in the domain name base   



growth in the domain name base has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars however competitive pressure from cctlds other gtlds services that offer alternatives for an online presence such as social media ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants managing their investment in domain names and historical global economic uncertainty has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in the past and may continue to do so in the future 

revenues increased by 625 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in revenues from the operation of the registry for the com tld driven by a 5 increase in the domain name base for com and the price increase which became effective september 1 2021 

geographic revenues 

we generate revenues in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” china and certain other countries including canada australia and japan the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues in the table above are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region revenues increased during 2021 in all regions except china revenues from registrars based in china declined during 2021 as a result of lower new registrations and renewal rates in the country 

we expect revenues to continue to grow in 2022 as a result of continued growth in the aggregate number of  com domain names and the impact of the price increase for com domain names which became effective september 1 2021 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 



cost of revenues increased by 118 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in direct cost of revenues allocated overhead expenses and depreciation expenses direct cost of revenues increased by 57 million primarily due to an increase in registry fees payable to icann in connection with the operation of the registry for the com tld allocated overhead expenses increased by 24 million due to an increase in total allocable expenses depreciation expenses increased by 19 million as a result of increased investments in our data centers and network infrastructure 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



sales and marketing expenses increased by 31 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a 26 million increase in salary and employee benefits expenses as a result of an increase in average headcount and higher expenses for salaries and certain employee related benefits 

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



research and development expenses increased by 59 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation and a combination of individually insignificant factors salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation increased by 30 million due to a slight increase in average headcount and higher expenses for salaries and certain employee related benefits 

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees and certain tax and license fees offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 



general and administrative expenses decreased by 08 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to decreases in professional services expenses and charitable contributions and an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses equipment and software expenses and stockbased compensation expenses professional services expenses decreased by 60 million due to a decrease in external consulting costs on various projects overhead expenses allocated to other cost types increased by 50 million due to an increase in the total allocable expenses charitable contributions decreased by 16 million due to greater contributions made during 2020 to help with immediate covidrelated hardship and to support social justice efforts compared to contributions made during 2021 salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 47 million due to an increase in average headcount and higher expenses for certain employee health insurance related benefits equipment and software expenses increased by 55 million due to expenses related to network security and other software services stockbased compensation expenses increased by 30 million due to higher achievement levels on certain performancebased rsu grants and increases in the total value of rsus granted in 2021 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by 69 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the lower interest rate on our 2031 notes compared to the 2023 notes which were redeemed in june 2021 we expect interest expense to decrease in 2022 due to the lower interest rate on our 2031 notes compared to the 2023 notes 

nonoperating loss net 

see note 9 “nonoperating loss income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we expect nonoperating loss net to decrease in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in 2021 

income tax benefit expense 



the effective tax rate for each of the periods in the table above differed from the statutory federal rate of 21 due to a lower foreign effective tax rate offset by state income taxes and us taxes on foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits additionally during 2021 we completed a transfer of intellectual property between certain nonus subsidiaries this intellectual property did not have any book value however the transfer created an amortizable tax basis that resulted in the recognition of a 1655 million deferred tax asset and a corresponding income tax benefit 

during 2020 we recognized an income tax benefit of 2042 million as a result of the remeasurement of certain previously unrecognized income tax benefits the majority of this tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction taken in 2013 these remeasurements were based on written confirmations from internal revenue service “irs” received in 2020 indicating no examination adjustments would be proposed related to the worthless stock deduction or certain other matters reviewed as part of the audit of our federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2014 and the lapse of statutes of limitations related to other unrecognized income tax benefits notwithstanding these written confirmations our us federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2014 remain under examination by the irs 

as of december 31 2021 we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 2385 million net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of 

deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 

we expect the effective tax rate for 2022 to be between 21 and 24 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents our principal sources of liquidity 



the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist of amounts invested in money market funds time deposits and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of three months or less as of december 31 2021 all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “financial instruments” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2021 we repurchased 33 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 21516 for an aggregate cost of 7000 million under our share repurchase program in 2020 we repurchased 37 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 20006 for an aggregate cost of 7349 million effective february 10 2022 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of 7054 million in addition to the 2946 million that remained available for repurchases under the share repurchase program for a total repurchase authorization of up to 10 billion under the program 

on june 8 2021 we issued 7500 million of 2700 senior unsecured notes due june 15 2031 on june 23 2021 we used the net proceeds from the 2031 notes along with cash on hand to redeem all of our 7500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4625 senior notes due 2023 as of december 31 2021 we also had 5500 million principal amount outstanding of 475 senior unsecured notes due 2027 and 5000 million principal amount outstanding of 525 senior unsecured notes due 2025 as of december 31 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under our 2000 million credit facility that will expire in 2024 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months and beyond we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs our most significant future cash requirements include interest and principal payments on the senior notes issuances described above income tax payments purchase obligations and registry fees related to the operation of certain toplevel domains these items are detailed in note 11 “commitments and contingencies” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

in summary our cash flows for 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by increases in cash paid for income taxes cash paid to employees and vendors and decreases in cash received from interest on investments and from transition services cash received from customers increased primarily due to higher domain name registrations and renewals and the impact of the com price increase which became effective september 1 2021 the increased volume of renewal transactions was due in part to early renewal transactions before the com price increase became effective cash paid for income taxes increased primarily due to comparatively higher federal state and foreign taxes cash paid to employees and vendors increased primarily due to the timing of payments and an increase in operating expenses cash received from interest on investments decreased due to a decline in interest rates cash received from transition services decreased due to the expiration of the transition services agreement related to our divested security services business in february 2020 

cash flows from investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities purchases of property and equipment and the sale of businesses 

  

net cash used in investing activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities and investments net of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities and investments an increase in purchases of property and equipment and payments received during 2020 related to our divested security services business 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from borrowings repayment of borrowings and our employee stock purchase plan 

  

net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of the 2031 notes and a decrease in share repurchases partially offset by the redemption of our 2023 notes 

income taxes 

  

we expect cash paid for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income to be between 21 and 24 in 2022 

property and equipment expenditures 

  our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2022 are anticipated to be between 400 million and 500 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades software enhancements 

dilution from rsus 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2021 there were a total of 06 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of less than 10 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2021 we had 102 billion of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business in several countries and transact in multiple foreign currencies the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the us dollar our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2021 we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 303 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

  market risk management 

the fair market values of our senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2021 the fair values of the senior notes issued in 2015 2017 and 2021 were 5523 million 5739 million and 7555 million respectively based on available market information from public data sources

services 

we operate the authoritative directory of andor the backend systems for all com net cc tv gov jobs edu and name domain names among others our services allow individuals and organizations to establish their online identities while providing the secure alwayson access they need to communicate and transact reliably with largescale online audiences 

  

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” among others under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com agreement the us department of commerce “doc” we are also the exclusive registry of domain names within certain transliterations of com and net in a number of different native languages and scripts “idn gtlds” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names eg examplecom and examplenet in these gtlds and idn gtlds our global constellation of dns servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows icannaccredited registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into central directories and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

in addition to our registry agreements with icann we have agreements to operate the registries for the tv and cc country code toplevel domains “cctlds” for tuvalu and cocos keeling islands respectively and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs and edu sponsored tlds among others these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of dns servers and shared registration system 

  

we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access domain names in characters representing their local language our gtlds and cctlds can support standardscompliant domain name registrations in over 100 different native languages and scripts 

we also perform the root zone maintainer function under an agreement with icann for the core of the internet’s dns and operate two of the 13 root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the top of the dns hierarchy 

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years the fees charged for com  net and name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc and tv domain names and our idn gtlds are based on a similar fee system and registration system although the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by the doc on com  or icann with respect to net and name  the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us government the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure and that of others for which verisign provides such services are based on the terms of verisign’s agreements with those respective registry operators  

  

operations infrastructure 

our operations infrastructure consists of secure data centers in dulles virginia ashburn virginia new castle delaware and fribourg switzerland as well as more than 100 other sites around the world our domain name servers refer requestors to the associated authoritative name servers for second level domains under our tlds thus enabling dns resolution for every com and net domain name on the internet and for domain names under a large number of other tlds our servers process more than 215 billion queries daily our operations infrastructure operates 24 hours a day supporting our services the performance and availability of our infrastructure are critical for our business key features of our operations infrastructure include 

  

• distributed servers we operate a large number of highspeed servers globally to support localized capacity and performance demands in conjunction with our proprietary software processes and procedures this global constellation of servers offers rapid failover global and local load balancing and threshold monitoring on critical servers 

  

• networking we deploy and maintain a redundant and diverse global network maintain highspeed redundant connections to numerous internet service providers and maintain peering relationships globally to ensure that our critical services are readily accessible to customers at all times 

  

• security we incorporate architectural concepts such as protected domains restricted nodes and distributed access control in our system architecture in addition we employ firewalls and intrusion detection software as well as proprietary security mechanisms at many points across our infrastructure we perform recurring internal vulnerability testing and controls audits and also contract with thirdparty security consultants who perform periodic penetration tests and security risk assessments on our systems we have engineered resiliency and diversity into how we host classes of products throughout our set of interconnected sites to mitigate unknown vendor defects and zerohour security vulnerabilities this includes different physical security silos which themselves are separated into bulkheads and in which servers are located corporate networks are in their own physical silo thus the corporate networks to which personnel directly connect are separated from the silos that house production services administration of production gear from corporate systems must go through an internal fortified intermediary and account credentials used within the corporate networks are not used within the production silos nor on the fortified systems 

• data integrity we employ both phased and systemic integrity validation operations via a number of proprietary mechanisms on all internal dns publication operations 

  

we have continuously expanded our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to address projected internet attack trends 

  

call centers and help desk we provide customer support services over the phone by email and through webbased selfhelp systems our support teams are staffed with trained technical customer support agents support is available for customers 24 hours a day every day of the year throughout the covid19 pandemic our support teams have continued servicing our customers while working remotely 

  

operations support and monitoring through our network operations center we have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical database systems and our global resolution systems our network operations center monitors our systems 24 hours a day every day of the year and has continued to be staffed by employees working remotely during the covid19 pandemic 

  

disaster recovery plans we have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities we maintain data centers with mirrored services that allow failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity as well as a tertiary facility in switzerland our critical data services including domain name registration and global resolution use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as synchronous mirroring and remote replication we periodically operate services at an alternate data center during maintenance windows to ensure the availability of our data centers for disaster recovery 

marketing sales and distribution 

we seek to expand our business through focused marketing campaigns and programs that target growth in the com and net domain name base both domestically and in foreign markets we provide tools to be used by both registrars and end users to enable them to find relevant domain names we have marketing and sales offices in several countries around the world 

research and development 

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and new and enhanced ways to ensure the security stability and resiliency of our services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace 

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by ongoing technological developments shifting channel dynamics frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and the continued evolution of security threats will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services and to introduce both new and enhanced products and services 

competition   

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration in addition to the gtlds and cctlds we operate or for which we provide backend registry services there are over 1200 other operational gtld registries over 250 ascii cctld registries more than 50 idn cctld registries and over 90 idn gtld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and other gtlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage among our competitors operating gtld and cctld registries are china internet network information center cnnic denic nominet public interest registry pir donuts godaddy and radix 

to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation via domain names or transact on ecommerce platforms we face competition from search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu social media networks such as facebook and wechat ecommerce platforms such as amazon ebay and taobao and microblogging tools such as twitter in addition we face competition from these social media and ecommerce platforms if they are used by businesses and individuals to establish an online presence rather than through the use of a domain name 

furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of mobile applications to locate and access content we face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure in addition our industry is characterized by collaborative relationships involving and consolidation of our competitors our ability to participate and benefit from such collaborative arrangements or consolidations may be limited and such collaborative arrangements and consolidations could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our business 

we compete with numerous companies that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to registries that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among our competitors are donuts centralnic ltd and godaddy 

industry regulation 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations icann plays a central coordination role in this bottomup multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit icann’s multistakeholder policy development processes have created and will continue to create policies programs and standards that directly or indirectly impact our business certain policies can be adopted as consensus or temporary policies which we are obligated to follow under our agreements with icann for example in response to the general data protection regulation icann issued a temporary policy modifying public access to information from the whois services delivered by registrars and registries 

we are also subject to countrylevel laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign countries in china we are required to maintain licenses for  com and  net tlds under regulations issued by the ministry of industry and information technology the licenses for the  com and  net tlds must be renewed in 2022 additionally in many jurisdictions in which we operate including california the european union the united kingdom china and elsewhere strict new data security and data privacy regulations have been or are being adopted because we do not possess extensive personal information we have not yet experienced significant impacts from these regulations however compliance costs and other business impacts could become significant as regulatory enforcement increases as courts interpret these regulations and as new laws and regulations continue to be adopted other regulations or changes to regulations may also impact our business operations including changes to the digital services act or network and information security directive in the european union or the communications decency act in the united states 

com toplevel domain

other significant terms within the  com registry agreement include performance specifications and service level agreements for the availability of our dns resolution services our shared registration system and our whois services the  com registry agreement contains marketing limitations including limitations on our ability to bundle products and the manner in which we provide marketing support to icannaccredited registrars we are also required under the  com registry agreement to provide icannaccredited registrars with access to our systems to register or take other actions related to domain names in order to introduce new registry services or make material changes to existing registry services we must follow prescribed procedures which permit icann to review and approve such services 

the com registry agreement requires that on a quarterly basis we pay 025 to icann for each annual term of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter amendment 3 to the  com registry agreement permits an increase to the maximum price as defined in the com registry agreement of com domain name registrations by up to 7 over the previous year in each of the final four years of each sixyear period the first such sixyear period began on october 26 2018 amendment 3 also clarified that the restrictions in the com registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the com tld and also clarified that our ability to increase prices by 7 over the previous year due to new icann consensus policies or documented extraordinary expense may occur only in years where we do not otherwise take the price increases described above 

our operation of the  com tld is also subject to the terms of a cooperative agreement with the doc the cooperative agreement has undergone various amendments with the most recent amendment 35 on october 26 2018 amendment 35 extended the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 which will automatically renew on the same terms 

for successive sixyear terms unless the doc provides written notice of nonrenewal 120 days prior to the end of the thencurrent term 

amendment 35 includes the doc’s consent to the modification of the pricing terms in the  com registry agreement as described above further we are entitled to increase the maximum price of a com domain name due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security or stability of the dns as described in the com registry agreement provided that we may not exercise such right unless the doc provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest such approval not to be unreasonably withheld the cooperative agreement further provides that we shall be entitled at any time during the term of the com registry agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the com registry agreement if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the com registry agreement as determined by the doc 

doc approval of changes to or the renewal of the  com registry agreement was limited by amendment 35 to only the following circumstances 1 changes to the pricing provisions other than as approved in amendment 35 2 changes to the vertical integration provisions other than the clarification approved in amendment 35 3 changes to the security stability and resiliency posture as reflected in the functional or performance specifications including the service level agreements 4 changes to the conditions for renewal or termination of the com registry agreement or 5 changes to the whois service except as mandated by icann through temporary or consensus policies as was the case with prior amendments amendment 35 is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on the company with respect to the  com registry agreement 

finally amendment 35 clarified that the restrictions in the com registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the  com tld as to the  com tld we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar that sells  com domain names in addition under amendment 35 we have agreed to continue to operate the  com tld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of contentneutral policies for the operation of the dns

 item 1a   risk factors 

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize our business operating results financial condition reputation cash flows or prospects can be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition reputation cash flows and prospects actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below 

cybersecurity and technology risk factors 

attempted security breaches including from the exploitation of vulnerabilities cyberattacks and distributed denial of service “ddos” attacks against our systems and services increase our costs expose us to potentially material liability and could materially harm our business and reputation 

as an operator of critical internet infrastructure we experience a high rate of cyberattacks and attempted security breaches targeting our systems and services including the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat attacks and zerohour threats the forms of these attacks are constantly evolving and may involve methods tools and strategies that have not been previously identified or observed until the moment of launch or until sometime after making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against in addition to external threats our systems and services are subject to insider threat risks including physical or electronic breakins sabotage and from suppliers such as consultants and advisors saas providers hardware software and network systems manufacturers regional internet registries and other vendors or from current or former contractors or employees these threats and any resulting security breach can arise from intentional or unintentional actions our continued exposure to these threats and the potential that they could lead to material liability claims against us requires us to expend significant financial and other resources our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security threats including insider threats could result in material harm to our business including loss of or delay in revenues failure to meet contracted servicelevel obligations material liability claims failure to maintain market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs and could call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

security vulnerabilities in our systems and our vendors’ systems including vulnerabilities in third party software and hardware pose a material risk to our operations we use externallydeveloped technology systems and services including both hardware and software for a variety of purposes including compute storage encryption and authentication backoffice support and other functions we have developed policies and procedures to reduce the impact of security vulnerabilities in system components as well as at any vendors where our data is stored or processed however such measures cannot provide absolute security while we strive to remediate known vulnerabilities on a timely basis such vulnerabilities could be exploited before our remediation is effective and if so could cause systems and service interruptions data loss and other damages our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security vulnerabilities including any potential failure to timely replace and upgrade network equipment servers or other technology assets could result in material harm to our business including loss of or delay in revenues failure to meet contracted servicelevel obligations material liability claims failure to maintain market acceptance injury to our reputation increased costs and call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

in addition our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks recent industry experience has demonstrated that ddos attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication and have the ability to widely disrupt internet services in recent years the size of ddos attacks has grown rapidly we have successfully mitigated ddos attacks during this time frame that are significantly larger than those we have historically experienced while we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against ddos attacks there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any attack even if only partially successful could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our service level obligations and generally impede our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community we have historically incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to enable our infrastructure to process levels of attack traffic that are significant multiples of our normal transaction volume we are employing new technologies and new and different services and capabilities to help mitigate ddos attacks if these new technologies services and capabilities are not effective our networks could be disrupted our response times could increase our ability to meet our contracted service level obligations could be negatively impacted and our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community could be impeded 

we may introduce undetected or unknown defects into our systems or services which could materially harm our business and harm our vendors or our customers 

despite testing services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors which could result in service outages or disruptions compromised customer data including dns data diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs performance of our services whether or not defective could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered on internet users and consumers and on thirdparty applications and services that use our services any of which could result in legal claims against us while we strive to prevent detect and remediate defects or errors they can and do occur and they could result in our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner failure to meet our contracted service level obligations injury to our reputation and increased costs 

our infrastructure and services are subject to vulnerabilities in the global routing system for the internet as well as risks arising from internet services providers’ increasing adoption of the resource public key infrastructure system 

routing on the internet depends on the border gateway protocol “bgp” which is a protocol that relies on networks within the internet infrastructure acting in a trustworthy manner when sharing information about destinations for connectivity and the routing of internet traffic as a trustbased protocol bgp has a number of vulnerabilities that may lead to outages or disrupt our services including as a result of “route hijacks” that involve accidental or malicious rerouting of internet traffic or “route leaks” that involve the malicious or unintentional propagation of routing information beyond the intended scope of the originator receiver andor one of the networks along the route’s path both route hijacks and route leaks can result in partial or full rerouting of internet traffic for the impacted destinations these events which are beyond our control could enable an array of attack conditions or service disruptions and could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the public’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

to address internet routing system vulnerabilities many internet service providers are beginning to adopt and apply internet reachability policies based on a system known as the resource public key infrastructure “rpki” operated by the regional internet registries “rirs” the rirs allocate internet number resources such as internet protocol addresses to enterprises and network operators we have limited visibility into the maturity of and investment in the rirs’ operational and security controls which are outside of our control when the availability integrity or confidentiality of any of the information in the rpki system or systems used to maintain and administer rpki data and systems are impacted or otherwise compromised in any of the rirs or any network operator that is a relying party of the rpki system or the operations or ingestion of data from the rpki system are otherwise impacted by a known or unknown vulnerability our services may be negatively impacted such impacts may include degraded or full loss of reachability of service addresses in the global internet routing system resulting in degradation or complete loss of availability of our services a compromise of the rpki system and related services or unintentional or unauthorized manipulation of data therein may also result in other denial of service attack conditions for our infrastructure and services the systemic dependencies introduced by rpki and relying parties of the rpki system including network service providers are outside of our control and are only as secure as the weakest elements of the rpki system we may contract with one or more rirs to employ rpki which carries material operational risks as described above as well as material contractual risks which may expose us to service disruptions and material liability 

we could encounter system interruptions or systems failures resulting from activities beyond our direct control that could materially harm our business 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures damage or interruption caused by fire earthquake and other natural disasters intentional acts of vandalism terrorist attacks unintentional mistakes or errors our systems and operations also face risks inherent in or arising from the terms and conditions of our agreements with service providers to operate our networks and data centers we are also subject to state suppression of internet operations any of these problems or outages could create potential liability and exposure including from a failure to meet our contracted service level obligations and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

our data centers including the shared registration systems located at our data centers and our resolution systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption which could impede our ability to provide our services expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our owned data centers in 2019 we began expanding some of our data center services to a leased data center facility these data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption including from fires earthquakes hurricanes floods power loss hardware or system failures physical or electronic breakins human error or interference we are also updating our network architecture in several of our new and existing data centers if our data center facilities or the updated 

network architecture do not operate as expected including the ability to quickly switch over between sites we could experience service interruptions or outages a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register or manage domain names for a period of time if such a registrar has not implemented robust services in a manner that preserves transactions until processed by the registry then the failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could also impact our ability to provide uptodate information in our resolution systems which could result in breaches of our service level obligations pertaining to our resolution services as well as impacting the resolution of domain names on the internet although we carry insurance we do not carry insurance or designated financial reserves for such interruptions 

in addition our services depend on the secure and efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the secure and efficient operation of internet service providers internet exchange point operators and internet backbone service providers such providers have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control and may continue to encounter problems and outages or may choose to discontinue their service if the providers that our connections depend upon do not protect maintain improve and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the dns through their networks our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation or update of the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers or the tld zone files that we operate including for example the  gov registry or other network functions could result in 1 a dns resolution or other service outage or degradation 2 the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet for a period of time 3 the deletion of one or more secondlevel domain names from the internet for a period of time or 4 a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the operation or update of the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could result in similar consequences any of these problems or outages could create potential material liability and exposure from litigation and investigations could result in a failure to meet our service level agreements and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business these problems could also result in adverse publicity decrease the public’s trust in the security of ecommerce or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

we retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information we retain or that is retained in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face material liability and exposure from litigation and investigations fail to meet contracted service level obligations or be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for operation of our businesses and customers could be reluctant to use our services any of which could also adversely affect our reputation and harm our business or cause financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance 

we face risks from the operation of the root server system and our performance of the root zone maintainer functions under the rzma 

although the overall root server system is redundant and dispersed a failure or interruption in the operation of the root server system could impact the effectiveness of our  com and  net authoritative servers and therefore negatively impact directory services necessary for the operation of the internet we also have an important operational role in support of a key internet assigned numbers authority “iana” function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative root zone data and make it available to all root server operators under the rzma with icann if we make errors in the publication of the root zone we may be subject to material claims challenging the rzma or our performance under it including tort claims and we may not have immunity from or sufficient indemnification or insurance for such claims 

contractual regulatory legal and compliance risk factors 

any loss or modification of our right to operate the  com and  net gtlds could have a material adverse impact on our business and result in loss of revenues 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operation of the  com gtld under our cooperative agreement with the doc and our  com registry agreement as well as our operation of the  net gtld under our net registry agreement any loss or modification of our right to operate the  com and  net gtlds could materially and adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and result in loss of revenues our  com and  net registry agreements contain “presumptive” rights of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms on november 30 2024 and june 30 2023 respectively icann could refuse to renew upon expiration or terminate our  com registry agreement or our  net registry agreement if upon proper notice 1 we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and 2 we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court additionally each of the com and net registry agreements provide that if certain terms of these agreements are not similar to such terms generally in effect in the registry agreements of the five largest gtlds then a 

renewal of these agreements would be upon terms reasonably necessary to render such terms to be similar to the registry agreements for those other gtlds any such terms if they apply could be unfavorable to us and have a material adverse impact on our business 

standard renewals of the  com registry agreement do not require further doc approval although the prior written approval of the doc is required for the removal of or any changes to the pricing section other than as approved in amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement and for changes to certain other specified terms whether such removal or changes is made at a renewal or otherwise we can provide no assurances that doc approval would be provided upon our request for any of these changes 

in addition under amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement we have agreed to continue to operate the  com gtld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of contentneutral policies for the operation of the dns and under our binding letter of intent with icann we have agreed to work with the icann community to develop certain best practices and other commitments for the security stability and resiliency of the dns and the internet such policies and processes could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

changes or challenges to the pricing provisions in the com registry agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business 

under the terms of the com registry agreement we may increase the annual fee of each com domain name registration or renewal by up to 7 over the previous year in each of the final four years of each sixyear period we can provide no assurance that we will exercise such right to increase the annual fee in addition to this contractual right we are entitled to increase the annual fee of each com domain name registration or renewal by up to 7 due to the imposition of any new specifications or policies adopted by icann pursuant to the procedures set forth in its bylaws and due process “consensus policies” or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the dns an “extraordinary expense” in addition our ability to increase the price for com domain name registrations and renewals due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense may occur only in years in which we do not increase the price for com domain name registrations and renewals as described above it is uncertain whether circumstances would arise that would permit us to take a price increase due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense or if they do whether we would seek to increase the price for com domain name registrations for this reason a failure to seek and obtain a price increase due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense when available could negatively affect our operating results we also have the right under the cooperative agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions on the com tld if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant these restrictions however it is uncertain whether we will seek the removal of these restrictions or whether the doc would approve the removal of these restrictions 

our com registry agreement including its pricing provisions has faced and could face in the future challenges including possible legal challenges or challenges under icann’s accountability mechanisms from icann registrars registrants and others and any adverse outcome from these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and internationally may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or internationally to the internet or the domain name industry have imposed and may in the future impose new costs and new restrictions on our business laws and regulations including those designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names or require registrants to provide additional documentation to register domain names have and may in the future impose significant additional costs on our business and subject us to additional liabilities or could prevent us from operating in certain jurisdictions for example the government of china has indicated that it will issue and has issued new regulations and has begun to enforce existing regulations that impose additional costs on and risks to our provision of registry services in china and could impact the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations in china registries including us and chinabased registrars are also required by some of these regulations to obtain a governmentissued license for each tld operating in china any failure to obtain the required licenses or to comply with any license requirements or any updates thereto by us or our chinabased registrars could impact our current and future business in china 

in addition laws have been and may be in the future adopted that are designed to restrict counterfeit goods or intellectual property violations such as cybersquatting or that restrict the transfer of data the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current locations expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

similarly the european union’s general data protection regulation which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds broad new requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and significant penalties became effective in may 2018 other countries and other states such as california with 

the california consumer privacy act have enacted or are enacting data protection laws regulating or limiting the collection storage and processing of personal data as well as granting new rights to data subjects to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and receive data originating from different jurisdictions and consequently we are subject to these continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws and regulations that are applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to international laws and regulations these evolving legal regulatory and compliance frameworks could impose significant costs for us that are likely to increase over time 

in addition as we market our tlds in international locations we are likely to raise our profile in certain foreign countries thereby increasing the regulatory and other scrutiny of our operations any negative developments arising from such increased scrutiny could diminish demand for our domain names increase our costs of regulatory compliance affect our reputation expose us to liability penalties or fines force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business 

our international operations expose us and our business to additional economic legal regulatory and political risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the us our business operations in international locations have required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular location and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international locations or expand our presence in existing locations failure to do so could materially harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

• competition with companies in international locations or other domestic companies entering international locations in which we operate as well as local governments actively promoting cctlds that we do not operate 

• political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies andor the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” of the us department of the treasury 

• tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• potential problems associated with adapting our services to technical conditions existing in different countries 

• difficulties in verifying enduser information including for the purposes of complying with the verification requirements of certain countries and with the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by ofac 

• more stringent privacy and data localization policies in some international jurisdictions 

• additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting us interests abroad 

• potentially conflicting or adverse tax consequences 

• reliance on third parties in international locations in which we only recently started doing business and 

• potential concerns of international governments or customers and prospects regarding doing business with us technology companies due to alleged us government data collection policies 

escalating political tensions between the united states and china in particular may pose additional risks to our business in china since 2018 the united states and china have imposed tariffs on certain of each other’s exports in 2019 and 2020 the us government announced restrictions on trading with certain chinese companies the chinese government subsequently announced actions that if implemented could impose additional restrictions on the chinese operations of nonchinese companies these and future government actions impacting our ability to operate in china may cause our management’s attention to be diverted our reputation to be damaged or our business in china to be adversely affected 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous international jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis because of a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure changes in tax laws that could adversely impact our income or nonincome taxes or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” plans to issue a final report that will provide a longterm multilateral proposal on the taxation of the digital economy if this proposal is ultimately agreed to and implemented by the oecd’s member states there could be significant modifications in the way multinational corporations are taxed in addition some international tax jurisdictions independent of the oecd have enacted or may enact new tax regimes aimed at income resulting from digital services although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such changes or the likelihood of such proposals being adopted throughout the world and tax treaties being modified accordingly any or all of these changes in tax policy for the digital economy could increase our taxes and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business faces risks arising from icann’s consensus and temporary policies technical standards and other processes 

our registry agreements with icann require us to implement consensus policies and changes mandated by icann through temporary specifications or policies “temporary policies” icann could adopt consensus policies or temporary policies that 1 are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of com  net and other gtlds that we operate 2 are inconsistent with our current or future plans 3 impose substantial costs on our business 4 subject the company to additional legal risks or 5 affect our competitive position these consensus policies or temporary policies could have a material adverse effect on our business for example icann has adopted a consensus policy that would require us to receive and display registrants’ personal and contact information and designated administrative and technical contact information “thick whois data” for com and  net  although that policy is undergoing modification by a new consensus policy that may make such transfer of thick whois data optional we can provide no assurances that such a modification will occur or that we would not choose to receive and display thick whois data for our  com and  net registries under it the costs of complying or failing to comply with consensus and temporary policies could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and exposure and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

our registry agreements with icann require us to implement and comply with various technical standards and specifications published by the internet engineering task force “ietf” icann could impose requirements on us through changes to these ietf standards or new standards that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position any such changes to the ietf standards or new standards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations if icann fails to uphold or significantly redefines the multistakeholder model it could harm our business 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 the us government completed a transition to the multistakeholder community of the historical role played by the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” in the coordination of the dns changes arising from this transition to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business for example icann has adopted bylaws that are designed in part to enhance its accountability through an organization called the empowered community which is comprised of a cross section of stakeholders icann or the empowered community may assert positions that could negatively impact our strategy or our business by completing the transition the us government through the ntia has ended its coordination and management of important aspects of the dns including the iana functions and the root zone there can be no assurance that the removal of the us government oversight of these key functions will not negatively impact our business 

claims lawsuits audits or investigations in which we are or could become involved may result in adverse outcomes to our business 

we are and may in the future become involved in claims lawsuits audits and investigations including intellectual property litigation and infringement claims litigation is inherently unpredictable and unexpected judgments or excessive verdicts do occur in addition proceedings that we initially view as immaterial could prove to be material adverse outcomes in lawsuits audits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example the current arbitration proceeding against icann challenging the validity of icann’s award of the web gtld to us could adversely affect our ability to operate the web gtld given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such claims lawsuits audits and investigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

strategic business and operating risk factors 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted how we operate our business and the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain 

the united states and the global community we serve are facing unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic the pandemic and the preventative measures taken in response to the pandemic including “shelterinplace” or “stayathome” and similar orders issued by international federal state or local authorities and the subsequent relaxation and reimposition of such orders have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in significant volatility business and economic disruptions and uncertainty in response to the pandemic we have taken steps to protect our employees including arranging for most of our employees to work remotely while we continue to operate all of our services including our registry services for com and net and our root operations however the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will continue to impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to control or predict including 

• the duration and scope of the pandemic 

• the extent and effectiveness of responsive actions including the relaxation and reimposition of orders by authorities and the delivery and administration of vaccines and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers and vendors 

• the impact of the pandemic on our key personnel and other employees including the impact of workfromhome arrangements on employee productivity and morale 

• the extent to which we are able to maintain and replace critical internet infrastructure components when necessary 

• our continued ability to execute on business continuity plans for the maintenance of our critical internet infrastructure while most of our employees continue to work remotely and 

• any negative impact on the demand for new and renewal domain name registrations resulting from the economic disruption caused by the pandemic and responses thereto 

further the impact of covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors any of which could have a material effect on us as of the date of this form 10k our financial condition and results of operations have not been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic regardless t his situation is uncertain and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider present material risks to our operations i f we are unable to successfully respond to and manage the impact of the pandemic and the resulting responses to it our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted and the impact could be material 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer lower demand for our products reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

we face competition from services that provide an online identity or presence including other gtld and cctld registries in order to remain competitive and retain our market position we must continually demonstrate the safety security and resiliency of our services and must adopt and support new technologies to adapt our services to changing technologies market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices if we do not successfully evolve and demonstrate the value of our services we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and such competitive pressures could materially harm our business in addition competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies 

noncompetitive or obsolete finally consolidation within our industry has occurred and is likely to continue to occur our ability to participate and benefit from such consolidations may be limited and consolidation within our industry amongst our competitors could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our business 

we have been designated as the registry operator for certain new gtlds including certain idn gtlds our new gtlds may not be as or more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors in addition our new gtlds may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges and it is possible that resolution of domain names within some of these new gtlds may be blocked within certain state or organizational environments challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability 

see the “competition” section in part i item 1 of this form 10k for further information 

the evolution of technologies or internet practices and behaviors the adoption of substitute technologies or wholesale price increases of our domain names may negatively impact the demand for the domain names for which we are the registry operator 

the growth of technologies including social media mobile devices apps and the dominance of search engines has evolved and continues to evolve changing the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses these ongoing changes can negatively impact the demand for our domain names in addition registrants purchase domain names for a variety of reasons including personal commercial and investment reasons changes in the motivation of domain name registrants can negatively impact our business 

technology changes to web browser or internet search technologies could reduce demand for domain names similarly if internet users’ preferences or practices shift away from recognizing and relying on web addresses or if internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content demand for our domain names could be negatively impacted demand for our domain names could be negatively impacted by new technologies that significantly decrease the use of domain names to develop and protect an online identity new technologies that encourage internet users to expand the use of thirdlevel domains or alternate identifiers such as identifiers from social networking ecommerce platforms and microblogging sites could also negatively impact the demand for our domain names in addition demand for domain names in our tlds could be impacted by alternative tlds that are operated outside the single authoritative root zone have been and continue to be proposed for example as part of certain blockchain namespace systems to the extent that web browsers applications registrars and dns resolvers recognize and support such tlds and that internet users are able to perform online operations with such tlds demand for domain names in tlds in the single authoritative root zone including our tlds could be negatively impacted 

some registrars and registrants seek to purchase and resell domain names at an increased price adverse changes in the resale value of domain names changes in the business models for such domain name registrars and registrants or other factors including regulations limiting the resale of domain names could result in a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for domain names in our tlds 

some registrars and registrants seek to generate revenues by registering domain names specifically for website advertising changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo baidu and bing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market for domain names used for this purpose which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for such domain names in addition if spending on online advertising and marketing is reduced this may result in a further decline in the demand for domain names used for this purpose 

under the terms of the com registry agreement as amended we may increase the annual fee of each com domain name registration or renewal by up to 7 over the previous year in each of the final four years of each sixyear period to the extent we increase wholesale prices there could be a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for com domain names 

if we fail to expand our services into developing and emerging economies in foreign locations our business may not grow 

we seek to serve many new developing and emerging economies in foreign locations to grow our business these economies are rapidly evolving and may not grow or even if they do grow our services may not be widely used or accepted there accordingly the demand for our services in these locations is uncertain factors that may affect acceptance or adoption of our services in these locations include 

• regional internet infrastructure development expansion penetration and adoption and the development maturity and depth of our sales channels 

• acceptance and adoption of substitute products and services that enable online presence without a domain name including social media ecommerce platforms website builders and mobile applications 

• increased acceptance and adoption of other substitute products and services including cctlds or other gtlds 

• public perception of the security of our technologies and of ip and other networks 

• the introduction and consumer acceptance of new generations of mobile devices and in particular the use of mobile applications as the primary engagement mechanism for navigating the internet and 

• government regulations affecting the internet internet access and availability domain name registrations or the provision of registry services data security or data localization ecommerce or telecommunications 

if our services are not widely accepted or adopted in these locations our business may not grow 

our business depends on registrars and their resellers maintaining their focus on marketing our products and services 

all of the domain name registrations and renewals for the registries we operate occur through registrars registrars and their resellers engage in substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names as well as their own associated offerings consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers including vertical integration by registrar or reseller industry participants could result in significant changes to their businesses operating models and cost structures these changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for the domain names for which we are the registry operator 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars and resellers have chosen to and may continue to choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms our registrars and resellers sell domain name registrations of other competing registries including new gtlds and some also sell and support their own services for websites such as email website hosting and other services our registrars and resellers may be more motivated to sell to registrants to whom they can also market their own services to the extent that registrars and resellers focus more on selling and supporting their services and less on the registration and renewal of domain names in our tlds our revenues could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully market our services to and build and maintain strong relationships with new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent if we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling registrations of domain names in our tlds as opposed to other competing tlds including the new gtlds or their own services our business could be harmed 

we depend on highly skilled employees to maintain and provide innovative solutions for our business and our business could be harmed if we are not able to attract and retain such qualified talent 

our business is highly technical and requires individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique technologies configurations operating systems and software development tools we depend on the knowledge experience and performance of our highly skilled employees and leaders to effectively manage and provide innovative solutions for our business for example we require employees with expertise in dns operations and with certain cybersecurity specialties because such employees are in high demand by our competitors and other companies we must be able to attract integrate retain and motivate such highly skilled employees and leaders and we must implement succession plans for these employees or our business could be harmed 

intellectual property risk factors 

we rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of other countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and 

technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the ietf to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” in some cases we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

we also license externally developed technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions these externally developed technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our services launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate verisign in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously disclosed a subsidiary of afilias plc “afilias” a competitor and losing bidder in the web auction filed a form of arbitration proceeding against icann an independent review process “irp” under icann’s bylaws on november 14 2018 afilias alleges that the agreement between verisign and nu dotco llc “ndc” pertaining to  web violated icann’s new gtld applicant guidebook as a result afilias claims that icann had a duty to disqualify ndc’s bid and award the  web gtld to afilias afilias also claims that icann would violate its bylaws pertaining to competition by awarding the  web gtld to verisign afilias amended its irp request on march 21 2019 in part to oppose verisign’s and ndc’s participation in the irp a hearing was held on verisign’s and ndc’s applications for participation and on february 12 2020 the irp panel permitted verisign and ndc to participate in aspects of the irp in early august 2020 the irp panel held a hearing on afilias’ claims we expect the irp panel to issue its decision in the first quarter of 2021 we believe that afilias’ claims regarding verisign’s and ndc’s conduct are without merit and we intend to vigorously oppose afilias’ claims in this matter 

we are also involved in various investigations claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business none of which in our opinion will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any litigation regardless of the outcome any litigation may require us to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention

overview

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 1652 million  com and  net registrations in the domain name base the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors including overall economic conditions competition from cctlds other gtlds services that offer alternatives for an online presence such as social media and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals

covid19 update 

the united states and the global community we serve are facing unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic in response to the pandemic we have established a task force to monitor the pandemic and have taken a number of actions to protect our employees including restricting travel modifying our sick leave policy to encourage quarantine and isolation when warranted and directing most of our employees to work from home we have implemented our readiness plans which include the ability to maintain critical internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely we believe that the effects of the pandemic to date have led to a modest increase in the demand for domain names particularly as businesses and entrepreneurs have been seeking to establish or expand their presence online in response to the pandemic our revenues increased during 2020 primarily driven by an increase in the domain name base for the com tld however the situation remains uncertain and hard to predict the broader implications of the pandemic on our business and operations and our financial results including the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact future growth in the domain name base remain uncertain the duration and severity of the economic disruptions from the pandemic may ultimately result in negative impacts on our business and operations results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and capital and financial resources because fees for domain name registrations and renewals are generally due at the time of registration or renewal and revenues from such registrations and renewals are recognized ratably over their terms the effects of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods for further discussion see “risk factors – the effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted how we operate our business and the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  income taxes 

we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and internationally tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions are complex interrelated and periodically changing significant judgment or interpretation of these laws and regulations is often required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes including for example the calculations of taxable income in each jurisdiction deferred taxes and the availability and amount of deductions and tax credits 

the final taxes payable are also dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from various tax examinations we only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions and tax benefit amounts that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light 

of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in an outcome that is materially different from our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits see note 10 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits during 2020 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

our revenues are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds and from providing backend registry services to a number of tld registry operators all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered in the com and net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is determined pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with registrars or their resellers and the registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars the annual fee for a  com domain name registration has been fixed at 785 since 2012 on october 26 2018 verisign and the doc amended the cooperative agreement the amendment among other items extends the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 and permits the price of a com domain name to be increased subject to appropriate changes to the com registry agreement without further doc approval by up to 7 in each of the final four years of each sixyear period beginning on october 26 2018 on march 27 2020 verisign and icann amended the com registry agreement “third com amendment” that among other items incorporates these changes agreed to with the doc to the pricing terms we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our agreement with icann through june 30 2023 as part of our response to the covid19 crisis we announced on march 25 2020 that we would freeze registry prices for domain name registrations and renewals for all of our tlds including com and net  through the end of 2020 on july 23 2020 we announced that we would extend the freeze on registry prices for all of our tlds including com and net  through march 31 2021 on february 11 2021 we announced that we will increase the annual registrylevel wholesale fee for each new and renewal  com domain name registration from 785 to 839 effective september 1 2021 we offer promotional incentivebased discount programs to registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for com and net registrations are in us dollars 

a comparison of revenues is presented below 



the following table compares the  com and net domain name registrations in the domain name base   



growth in the domain name base has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars however competitive pressure from cctlds other gtlds services that offer alternatives for an online presence such as social media ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants managing their investment in domain names and historical global economic uncertainty has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2021 and beyond 

revenues increased by 334 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in revenues from the operation of the registry for the com tld partially offset by the elimination of revenues from our sale of our security services customer contracts the increase in revenues from the com tld was driven by a 4 increase in the domain name base for com  

geographic revenues 

we generate revenues in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” china and certain other countries including canada australia and japan the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues in the table above are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region the majority of our revenue growth in 2020 has come from increased sales to registrars based in the us and emea revenues from registrars based in china declined during 2020 as a result of lower new registrations and renewal rates in the country 

we expect revenues to continue to grow in 2021 as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2020 and continued growth in registrations in the domain name base in 2021 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 



cost of revenues remained consistent in 2020 compared to 2019 as a decrease in salary and employee benefits expenses was offset by an increase in direct cost of revenues salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 23 million due to a functional realignment of some headcount to research and development partially offset by headcount increases throughout the year and an increase in expenses for other employee benefits including expanded paid time off benefits provided to employees in response to the covid19 pandemic direct cost of revenues increased by 18 million as a result of an increase in registry fees primarily related to the com tld 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to increase slightly in 2021 as compared to 2020 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



sales and marketing expenses decreased by 98 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a 69 million decrease in advertising and marketing expenses and a combination of other individually insignificant factors advertising and marketing expenses declined as a result of decreases in marketing programs in various regions 

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



research and development expenses increased by 139 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses and allocated overhead expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 102 million as a result of several factors including a functional realignment of some headcount from cost of revenues additional headcount increases throughout the year and an increase in expenses for other employee benefits including expanded paid time off benefits provided to employees in response to the covid19 pandemic allocated overhead expenses increased by 40 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount relative to other cost types 

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees and certain tax and license fees offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 



general and administrative expenses increased by 116 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses software license expenses charitable contributions and contract and professional services expenses partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expenses and an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 81 million as a result of an increase in average headcount as well as an increase in expenses for other employee benefits including expanded paid time off benefits provided to employees in response to the covid19 pandemic software license expenses increased by 33 million due to expenses related to network security and other software services charitable contributions increased by 36 million to support the response to the covid19 pandemic and to promote equal justice contract and professional services expenses increased by 20 million due to increases in expenses for network security and other corporate support services stockbased compensation expense decreased by 24 million as a result of a decrease in the projected achievement levels on certain performancebased rsu grants overhead costs allocated to other cost types increased by 30 million due to an increase in total allocable expenses 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020 

interest expense 

see note 4 “debt and interest expense” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we expect interest expense to remain consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020 

nonoperating income net 

see note 9 “nonoperating income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we expect nonoperating income net to decrease in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the transition services income and gain recognized in 2020 in connection with the sale of our security services customer contracts which will not recur in 2021 and lower interest income in 2021 as a result of lower interest rates 

income tax benefit expense 



the effective tax rate for each of the periods in the table above differed from the statutory federal rate of 21 due to a lower foreign effective tax rate and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation offset by state income taxes and us taxes on foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits 

additionally during 2020 we recognized an income tax benefit of 2042 million as a result of the remeasurement of certain previously unrecognized income tax benefits the majority of this tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction taken in 2013 these remeasurements were based on written confirmations from internal revenue service “irs” received in 2020 indicating no examination adjustments would be proposed related to the worthless stock deduction or certain other matters reviewed as part of the audit of our federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2014 and the lapse of statutes of limitations related to other unrecognized income tax benefits notwithstanding these written confirmations our us federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2014 remain under examination by the irs 

as of december 31 2020 we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 744 million net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 

we qualified for a tax holiday in switzerland until the end of 2019 which lowered tax rates on certain types of income and required certain thresholds of foreign source income the tax holiday reduced our foreign income tax expense by 173 million 015 per share in 2019 the benefit from the tax holiday is calculated before consideration of any offsetting tax impact in the united states effective january 1 2020 due to swiss tax law changes the tax holiday was eliminated which was partially offset by a lowered statutory tax rate 

we expect the effective tax rate for 2021 to be between 20 and 23 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2020 our principal source of liquidity was 4012 million of cash and cash equivalents and 7657 million of marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of three months or less as of december 31 2020 all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “financial instruments” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2020 we repurchased 37 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 20006 for an aggregate cost of 7349 million under our share repurchase program in 2019 we repurchased 39 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 18884 for an aggregate cost of 7385 million effective february 11 2021 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of 7470 million in addition to the 2530 million that remained available for repurchases under the share repurchase program for a total repurchase authorization of up to 10 billion under the program 

as of december 31 2020 we had 5500 million principal amount outstanding of 475 senior unsecured notes due 2027 5000 million principal amount outstanding of the 525 senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 7500 million principal amount outstanding of the 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2023 as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in 2024 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for income taxes and decreases in cash received from interest on investments and from transition services partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers cash paid for income taxes increased as we used the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards by the end of 2019 cash received from interest on investments decreased due to a decline in interest rates cash received from transition services decreased due to the expiration of the transition services agreement related to our sale of our security services customer contracts in february 2020 cash received from customers increased primarily due to higher domain name registrations and renewals 

cash flows from investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities purchases of property and equipment and the sale of businesses 

  

we had net cash outflows from investing activities in 2020 compared to net cash inflows during 2019 primarily due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities and investments net of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities and investments and an increase in purchases of property and equipment partially offset by contingent consideration received related to our sale of security services customer contracts 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases repayment of borrowings and our employee stock purchase plan 

  

net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases 

impact of inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented 

income taxes 

  

we expect cash paid for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income to be between 20 and 23 in 2021 

property and equipment expenditures 

  our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2021 are anticipated to be between 550 million and 650 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 11 “commitments and contingencies” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2020 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 11 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

dilution from rsus 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2020 there are a total of 07 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of less than 10 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2020 we had 101 billion of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business in several countries and transact in multiple foreign currencies the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the us dollar our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2020 we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 275 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

  market risk management 

the fair market values of our senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2020 the fair values of the senior notes issued in 2013 2015 and 2017 were 7588 million 5691 million and 5899 million respectively based on available market information from public data sources

services

in addition to our registry agreements with icann we have agreements to operate the registry for the tv and cc country code toplevel domains “cctlds” for tuvalu and cocos keeling islands respectively and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs and edu sponsored tlds among others these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of dns servers and shared registration system 

  

we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language our gtlds and cctlds can support standardscompliant registrations in over 100 different native languages and scripts 

we also perform the root zone maintainer function under an agreement with icann for the core of the internet’s dns and operate two of the 13 root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy 

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years the fees charged for com  net and name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc and tv domain names and our idn gtlds are based on a similar fee system and registration system although the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by the doc on com  or icann with respect to net and name  the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure and that of others for which verisign provides such services are based on the terms of verisign’s agreements with those respective registry operators  

  

operations infrastructure 

our operations infrastructure consists of three secure data centers in dulles virginia new castle delaware and fribourg switzerland as well as more than 100 resolution sites around the world our domain name servers provide the associated authoritative name servers and ip addresses for every com and net domain name on the internet and a large number of other tld queries processing more than 192 billion queries daily these secure data centers operate 24 hours a day supporting our business units and services the performance and scale of our infrastructure are critical for our business and give us the platform to maintain our leadership position key features of our operations infrastructure include 

  

   

   



personnel directly connect are separated from the silos that house production services administration of production gear from corporate systems must go through an internal fortified intermediary and account credentials used within the corporate networks are not used within the production silos nor on the fortified systems 

   

we have continuously expanded our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to address projected internet attack trends 

  

call centers and help desk we provide customer support services through phonebased call centers email help desks and webbased selfhelp systems our virginia call center is staffed with trained customer support agents 24 hours a day every day of the year 

  

operations support and monitoring through our network operations center we have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical database systems and our global resolution systems our network operations center is staffed 24 hours a day every day of the year 

  

disaster recovery plans we have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities we maintain dual mirrored data centers that allow rapid failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity as well as offcontinent tertiary facilities our critical data services including domain name registration and global resolution use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as synchronous mirroring and remote replication 

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we seek to expand our business through focused marketing campaigns and programs that target growth in the com and net domain name base both domestically and in foreign markets we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we provide tools to be used by both registrars and end users to enable them to find relevant domain names we have marketing and sales offices in several countries around the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and new and enhanced ways to ensure the security stability and resiliency of our services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace 

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration establish an online presence as well as other uses of domain names such as branded email in addition to the gtlds and cctlds we operate or for which we provide backend registry services there are over 1200 other operational gtld registries over 250 latin script cctld registries more than 50 idn cctld registries and over 90 idn gtld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and other gtlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media or transact on ecommerce platforms as opposed to direct navigation we face competition from search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu social media networks such 

as facebook and wechat ecommerce platforms such as amazon ebay and taobao and microblogging tools such as twitter in addition we face competition from these social media businesses and ecommerce platforms if they are used by businesses and individuals to establish an online presence rather than through the use of a domain name furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and mobile applications to locate and access content we face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 

we compete with numerous companies that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to registries that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among our competitors are afilias plc centralnic ltd and neustar inc 

industry regulation 

  

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit the multistakeholder process has and will continue to create policies programs and standards that directly or indirectly impact or affect our business in addition countrylevel regulations such as those implemented by china impose additional costs on our business can affect the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations and may also affect our ability to do business for example under its internet domain name regulations china’s ministry of industry and information technology awarded licenses for the continued operation of the  com and  net tlds in china these licenses must be renewed in 2022 domestically and abroad legislative and regulatory bodies continue to enhance and modify data privacy protections which impact our collection and delivery of personal data as we provide our domain name registry services and could affect our costs of operation 

as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com and net gtlds we have entered into certain agreements with icann and in the case of  com  the doc under a cooperative agreement 

  

com registry agreement 

the extension of the com registry agreement effective on october 20 2016 provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com gtld through november 30 2024 as part of the extension of the com registry agreement the company and icann agreed to cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the com registry agreement i by october 20 2018 to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the internet or the com tld and ii as may be necessary for consistency with changes to or the termination or expiration of the cooperative agreement on january 3 2020 the company and icann announced that they reached a proposed agreement to amend the com registry agreement “proposed com amendment” and to enter into a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security stability and resiliency of the dns in the form of a binding letter of intent “proposed loi” together these agreements satisfy the requirements described above as part of the com registry agreement extension in conjunction with the public announcement icann published the proposed com amendment and proposed loi for public comment until february 14 2020 following the close of the comment period and review of the public comments icann will prepare and publish a summary and analysis report thereafter icann and verisign will determine whether to ente r into the proposed com amendment and proposed loi 

the proposed com amendment among other items incorporates the applicable terms of amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement specifically the proposed  com amendment would allow verisign to increase the maximum price as defined in the com registry agreement of a com domain name registration by up to 7 in each of the final four years of each sixyear period the first such sixyear period began on october 26 2018 the proposed  com amendment also clarifies that the restrictions on the com registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the  com tld 

the proposed com amendment also clarifies that verisign’s ability to increase prices by 7 over the previous year due to new icann specifications or polices adopted by icann pursuant to the procedures set forth in its bylaws and due process “consensus policies” or documented extraordinary expense may occur only in years where verisign does not otherwise take the price increases described above in addition it sets forth additional obligations including updated technical and reporting requirements that are similar to requirements in icann’s new gtld base agreement 

the proposed loi formalizes a framework by which icann and the company will work together to support additional enhancements to the security and stability of the dns the proposed loi provides that the company will make payments annually to icann totaling 20 million over five years beginning on january 1 2021 to support icann’s initiatives to preserve and enhance the security stability and resiliency of the dns including root server system governance mitigation of dns security threats promotion andor facilitation of dnssec deployment the mitigation of name collisions and research into the operation of the dns a material term of the proposed loi is a signed confirmation by an icann offer confirming that icann incurred costs in the amount of verisign’s support payment during each period 

the com registry agreement includes a number of obligations including on a quarterly basis that we pay 025 to icann for each annual term of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter in addition we are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies “temporary policies” and consensus policies as well as other provisions relating to registry operations 

the com and net registry agreements with icann contain a “presumptive” right of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms icann could terminate or refuse to renew our  com andor net registry agreements if upon proper notice i we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and ii we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court see “risk factors  risks arising from our agreements governing our business could limit our ability to maintain or grow our business” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information our com and net registry agreements contain obligations to provide access to our systems restrictions on our ability to market and bundle our products and services and restrictions on our ability to control our registrar channel or own a registrar the com and  net registry agreements also provide a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve certain changes to registry services and requests by verisign to offer additional registry services the  com and  net registry agreements contain service level agreements for the availability of our dns resolution services our shared registration system and our whois services 

cooperative agreement 

verisign and the doc entered into amendment 35 of the cooperative agreement on october 26 2018 which among other items extends the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 the cooperative agreement will automatically renew on the same terms for successive sixyear terms unless the doc provides written notice of nonrenewal 120 days prior to the end of the thencurrent term under amendment 35 standard renewals of the  com registry agreement with icann will not require further doc approval although removal of or any changes to the pricing section other than as approved in amendment 35 changes to the vertical integration provisions other than the clarification approved in amendment 35 changes to the security stability and resiliency posture as reflected in the functional or performance specifications including the slas the conditions for renewal or termination or to the whois service except as mandated by icann through temporary or consensus policies as set forth in the amendment 35 would require further doc approval as was the case with prior amendments the doc’s approval of amendment 35 was not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on verisign with respect to the  com registry agreement 

under amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement the maximum price as defined in the com registry agreement of a com domain name may be increased without further doc approval by up to 7 in each of the final four years of each sixyear period the first such sixyear period began on october 26 2018 the changes to the maximum price under amendment 35 are not effective until such price increases are incorporated in the com registry agreement with icann through the proposed com amendment further we are entitled to increase the maximum price of a com domain name due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security or stability of the dns as described in the com registry agreement and as may be further clarified in the proposed com amendment provided that we may not exercise such right unless the doc provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest such approval not to be unreasonably withheld the cooperative agreement further provides that we shall be entitled at any time during the term of the com registry agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the com registry agreement if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the com registry agreement as determined by the doc also under amendment 35 we clarified that the restrictions in the com registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the  com tld as to the  com tld we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar that sells  com domain names in addition under amendment 35 we have agreed to continue to operate the  com tld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of contentneutral policies for the operation of the dns 

net registry agreement 

we entered into a renewal of our  net registry agreement with icann that was effective on july 1 2017 the net registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the net tld through june 30 2023

 item 1a   risk factors 

please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize our business operating results financial condition reputation cash flows or prospects can be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition reputation cash flows and prospects actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

risks arising from our agreements governing our business could limit our ability to maintain or grow our business 

we are parties to i a cooperative agreement as amended with the doc with respect to the  com gtld and ii registry agreements with icann with respect to the com  net name and other gtlds including our idn gtlds as substantially all of our revenues are derived from operation of these gtlds limitations and obligations in or changes or challenges to these agreements particularly the agreements that involve  com and  net  could have a material adverse impact on our business certain competing registries such as the cctlds are not subject to the same limitations or obligations that we are subject to in our agreements verisign and the doc entered into amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement on october 26 2018 which among other things extends the term of the cooperative agreement through november 30 2024 as amended by amendment 35 the cooperative agreement will automatically renew on the same terms for successive sixyear terms unless the doc provides written notice of nonrenewal within 120 days prior to the end of the thencurrent term further changes to the cooperative agreement require the mutual agreement of the doc and the company 

modifications or amendments in october 2016 the company and icann entered into an amendment to extend the term of the com registry agreement to november 30 2024 “first com amendment” as part of the first com amendment the company and icann agreed to negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the com registry agreement i by october 20 2018 to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the internet or the com tld and ii as may be necessary for consistency with changes to or the termination or expiration of the cooperative agreement on january 3 2020 the company and icann announced that they reached a proposed agreement to amend the com registry agreement “proposed com amendment” and to enter into a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security stability and resiliency of the dns in the form of a binding letter of intent “proposed loi” together these agreements satisfy the requirements described as part of the first com amendment in conjunction with the public announcement icann published the proposed com amendment and the proposed loi for public comment until february 14 2020 although we do not anticipate changes to these documents we can provide no assurance that modifications will not be made in connection with the public comment process or otherwise see the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 for further information 

under the cooperative agreement as amended by amendment 35 standard renewals of the  com registry agreement will not require further doc approval although removal of or any changes to the pricing section other than as approved in amendment 35 changes to the vertical integration provisions other than the clarification approved in amendment 35 changes to the security stability and resiliency posture as reflected in the functional or performance specifications including the slas changes to the conditions for renewal or termination or changes to the whois service other than such changes mandated by icann through temporary specifications or policies “temporary policies” and specifications or polices adopted by icann pursuant to the procedures set forth in its bylaws and due process “consensus policies” as set forth in amendment 35 the prior written approval of the doc is required we can provide no assurances that such approval would be provided 

in addition our registry agreements for new gtlds including the registry agreements for our idn gtlds include icann’s right to amend the agreements without our consent which could impose unfavorable contract obligations on us that could impact our plans and competitive positions with respect to new gtlds at the time of renewal of our com or net registry agreements icann might also attempt to impose this same unilateral right to amend these registry agreements under certain conditions icann has also included new mandatory obligations on new gtld registry operators including us that may increase the risks and potential liabilities associated with operating new gtlds icann might seek to impose these new mandatory obligations in our other registry agreements under certain conditions we can provide no assurance that any changes to our registry agreements as a result of the above obligations will not have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

pricing  under the terms of the cooperative agreement as amended by amendment 35 the company and icann may agree to amend the terms of the  com registry agreement to permit the price of registrations or renewals of  com domain names to be increased by up to 7 per year in each of the final four years of each sixyear period beginning on october 26 2018 the proposed com amendment would allow such price increases 

in addition we are entitled to increase the price up to 7 due to the imposition of any new consensus policies or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the dns “extraordinary expense” the proposed com amendment would clarify that verisign’s ability to increase prices due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense may occur only in years where verisign does not take a price increase as described in the above paragraph it is uncertain whether circumstances would arise that would permit a price increase due to a consensus policy or extraordinary expense or if they do whether we would seek to increase the price for com domain name registrations for this reason 

we also have the right under the cooperative agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions however it is uncertain whether we will seek the removal of such restrictions or whether the doc would approve the removal of such restrictions in comparison under the terms of the net and name registry agreements with icann we are permitted to increase the price of domain name registrations and renewals in these tlds up to 10 per year additionally icann’s registry agreements for new gtlds do not contain such pricing restrictions 

vertical integration  under amendment 35 the parties clarified that the restrictions in the com registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the  com tld this clarification is now set forth in the proposed com amendment as to the  com tld we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar that sells  com domain name registrations historically all gtld registry operators were subject to a vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal for certain other registry operators additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities if we seek to become vertically integrated except with respect to  com  it is uncertain whether approval to do so would be obtained under icann’s processes furthermore even if we obtain such approval we can provide no assurances that we will enter the domain name retail market or that we will be successful if we choose to do so if registry operators of other tlds including cctlds are able to obtain competitive advantages through vertical integration and we are not it could materially harm our business 

renewal and termination  our  com   net and  name registry agreements with icann contain “presumptive” rights of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms on november 30 2024 june 30 2023 and august 15 2020 respectively the registry agreements for our new gtlds including our idn gtlds are subject to a 10year term and contain similar “presumptive” renewal rights if certain terms in our com and net registry agreements are not similar to such terms generally in effect in the registry agreements of the five largest gtlds then a renewal of these agreements shall be upon terms reasonably necessary to render such terms similar to the registry agreements for those other gtlds there can be no assurance that such terms if they apply will not have a material adverse impact on our business a failure by icann to approve the renewal of the com registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2024 or to approve the renewal of the  net registry agreement prior to or upon the expiration of its current term on june 30 2023 would have absent an extension a material adverse effect on our business icann could terminate or refuse to renew our  com or  net registry agreements if upon proper notice i we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and ii we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court icann’s termination or refusal to renew either the  com or  net registry agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business 

consensus policies  our registry agreements with icann require us to implement consensus policies and temporary policies icann could adopt consensus policies or temporary policies that are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of com  net and our other gtlds that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position such consensus policies or temporary policies could have a material adverse effect on our business as an example icann has adopted a consensus policy that requires verisign to receive and display thick whois data for com and  net  although that policy is scheduled to be reviewed by icann in addition icann has adopted an interim consensus policy that establishes temporary requirements for registry operators and registrars regarding the collection display and disclosure of thick whois data pending icann’s establishment of a permanent consensus policy the costs of complying or failing to comply with these policies as well as laws and regulations such as general data protection regulation “gdpr” regarding personal information and data privacy such as domestic and various foreign privacy regimes could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

technical standards and icann processes our registry agreements with icann require verisign to implement and comply with various technical standards and specifications published by the internet engineering task force “ietf” icann could impose requirements on us through changes to these ietf standards that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position any such changes to the ietf standards could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition under 

amendment 35 we have agreed to continue to operate the  com tld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of contentneutral policies for the operation of the dns and under the proposed loi we have agreed to work with the icann community to develop certain best practices and other commitments for the security stability and resiliency of the dns and the internet such policies and processes could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

legal challenges  our registry agreements have faced and could face in the future challenges including possible legal challenges resulting from our activities or the activities of icann registrars registrants and others and any adverse outcome from such challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and overseas may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or overseas to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation for example the government of china has indicated that it will issue and in some instances has begun to issue new regulations and has begun to enforce existing regulations that impose additional costs on and risks to our provision of registry services in china and could impact the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations in china in addition to registry operators some of these regulations also require registrars to obtain a governmentissued license for each tld whose domain name registrations they intend to sell directly to registrants any failure to obtain the required licenses or to comply with any license requirements or any updates thereto by us or our registrars could impact our current and future business in china 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names online gambling counterfeit goods and intellectual property violations such as cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cybersecurity may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 

to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and receive data originating from different jurisdictions and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s gdpr which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and significant penalties became effective in may 2018 other countries and other states have enacted or are enacting data localization laws regulating or limiting data collection storage and transfer as well as granting new rights to data subjects all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements can impose significant costs for us that are likely to increase over time 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that federal state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified or enforced using new or novel legal theories and new laws may be enacted in the future in addition as we continue to launch and market our idn gtlds and increase our marketing efforts of our other tlds in foreign countries we may raise our profile in certain foreign countries thereby increasing the regulatory and other scrutiny of our operations any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation expose us to liability penalties or fines force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations 

undetected or unknown defects in our systems or services security breaches including from vulnerabilities defects in the technologies components and services in our supply chain and distributed denial of service “ddos” attacks could expose us to liability and materially harm our business and reputation 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in service outages or disruptions compromised customer data including dns data diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs any of which could harm our business performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as more broadly on internet users and consumers and on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security vulnerabilities and breaches or our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues failure to meet 

contracted service level obligations loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

in addition to undetected defects or errors we are also subject to cyberattacks and attempted security breaches we retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems it is critical to our business strategy as well as fulfilling our obligations as the registry operator for com and net that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure that we continue to meet our service level agreements and that we maintain the public’s trust in the internet services that we provide the company as an operator of critical internet infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat attacks and zerohour threats these forms of attacks involve situations where the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched in addition these forms of attacks may target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist only within the target’s supply chain or operating environment making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against in addition to external threats we may be subject to insider threats including those from thirdparty suppliers such as consultants and advisors saas providers hardware software and network systems manufacturers and other outside vendors or from current or former contractors or employees these threats can be realized from intentional or unintentional actions the shared registration system the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone maintainer system the tld name servers and the tld zone files that we operate are critical to our operations therefore attacks against thirdparty suppliers that provide services to our operations could also impact our infrastructure despite the significant time and money expended on our security measures we have been subject to a security breach that was previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins disruptions resulting from destructive malware hardware or enabling software defects computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may cause an outage of or jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability fail to meet contracted service level obligations customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for operation of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business or cause financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance that we maintain such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

we use externally developed technology systems and services including both hardware and software for a variety of purposes including without limitation compute storage encryption and authentication backoffice support and other functions while we have developed operational policies and procedures to reduce the impact of security vulnerabilities in system components as well as at any vendors where company data is stored or processed such measures cannot provide absolute security while we strive to remediate known vulnerabilities on a timely basis such vulnerabilities could be exploited before our remediation is effective and if so could cause systems and service interruptions data loss and other damages any of which could be materially harmful to our business vulnerabilities in and exploits leading to breaches of our or our vendors’ technology systems or services could expose us or our customers to a risk of outages loss or misuse of company data including but not limited to sensitive personal information 

additionally our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks recent attacks have demonstrated that ddos attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication and have an ability to widely disrupt internet services particularly since 2016 the size of ddos attacks has grown rapidly and we have successfully mitigated ddos attacks during this time frame that are significantly larger than those we have historically experienced while we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against such attacks there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any attack even if only partially successful could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our contracted service level obligations and generally impede our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community we have historically incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to enable our infrastructure to process levels of attack traffic that are significant multiples of our normal transaction volume further we are in the process of transitioning our security services customer contracts to neustar we will operate our ddos protection services during this transition period these ddos protection services share some of the infrastructure used to protect our registry services business therefore the operation of such services might expose our critical infrastructure to temporary degradations or outages caused by ddos attacks against those customers in addition to any attacks directed specifically against us and our networks any new technologies or services used to replace or enhance existing or future ddos and other attack mitigation capabilities may introduce risk that may not exist today in those environments and if security incidents occur associated with those new technologies or services could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our 

contracted service level obligations and generally impede our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community 

changes to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations 

role of the us government  in the fourth quarter of 2016 the us government completed a transition to the multistakeholder community of the historical role played by the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” in the coordination of the dns changes arising from this transition to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business for example icann has adopted bylaws that are designed in part to enhance accountability through a new organization called the empowered community which is comprised of a cross section of stakeholders icann or the empowered community may assert positions that could negatively impact our strategy or our business 

by completing the transition discussed above the us government through the ntia has ended its coordination and management of important aspects of the dns including the iana functions and the root zone there can be no assurance that the removal of the us government oversight of these key functions will not negatively impact our business 

role of icann  icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit if icann or the empowered community fails to uphold or significantly redefines the multistakeholder model it could harm our business additionally the empowered community could adversely impact icann which could negatively impact its ability to coordinate the multistakeholder system of governance or negatively affect our interests also legal regulatory or other challenges could be brought challenging the legal authority underlying the roles and actions of icann the empowered community or us 

role of foreign governments  some governments and members of the multistakeholder community have questioned icann’s role with respect to internet governance and as a result could seek a multilateral oversight body as a replacement additionally the role of icann’s governmental advisory committee which is comprised of representatives of national governments could change and give governments more control of certain aspects of internet governance some governments and governmental authorities outside the us have in the past disagreed and may in the future disagree with the actions policies or programs of icann the us government and us relating to the dns changes to the roles that foreign governments play in internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

we face risks from our operation of two root zone servers and performance of the root zone maintainer functions under the rzma 

we operate two of the 13 root zone servers root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and dns configuration data necessary to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet we also have an important operational role in support of a key iana function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative root zone data and make it available to all root server operators under an agreement with icann the root zone maintainer service agreement “rzma” 

as we perform the root zone maintainer services under the rzma we may be subject to significant claims challenging the agreement or our performance under the agreement and we may not have immunity from or sufficient indemnification or insurance for such claims 

additionally over 1200 new gtlds have already been delegated into the root zone in the current round of new gtlds icann plans on offering a subsequent round of new gtlds the timing of which remains uncertain we believe there are potential security and stability issues that could involve the root zone and at other levels of the dns from the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our and others’ efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all for example domain name collisions have been reported to icann which have resulted in various network interruptions for enterprises as well as confusion and usability issues that have led to phishing and other cyberattacks it is anticipated that as additional new gtlds are delegated now or in subsequent rounds more domain name collisions and associated security issues will occur 

the evolution of internet practices and behaviors and the adoption of substitute technologies may impact the demand for domain names 

domain names and the domain name system have been used by consumers and businesses to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity for many years the growth of technologies such as social media mobile devices apps and the dominance of search engines has evolved and changed the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses alike these changes can impact the demand for domain names by those who purchase domain names for personal commercial and investment reasons factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will monetize their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business some domain name registrars and registrants seek to purchase and resell domain names at an increased price adverse changes in the resale value of domain names changes in the business models for such domain name registrars and registrants or other factors including regulations limiting the resale of domain names could result in a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for domain names in our tlds such a resulting decrease in demand andor renewal rates could negatively impact the volume of new domain name registrations our renewal rates and our associated revenue growth 

some domain name registrants use a domain name to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser the use of an app on their smart phone or mobile device the use of a voice recognition technology such as alexa cortana google assistant or siri or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet users’ preferences or practices shift away from recognizing and relying on web addresses for navigation through the use of new and existing technologies iii internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content iv internet users were to significantly decrease the use of domain names to develop and protect their online identity or v internet users were to increasingly use thirdlevel domains or alternate identifiers such as identifiers from social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names in our tlds could decrease this may trigger current or prospective customers and parties in our target markets to reevaluate their need for registration or renewal of domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenues through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo baidu and bing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past changed and may change in the future its search algorithm which may decrease site traffic to certain websites and provide less payperclick compensation for certain types of websites this has reportedly made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

if any of the above factors negatively impact the renewal of domain names or the demand for new domain names we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

many of our markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business or our prospects could be harmed 

we seek to serve many new developing and emerging markets in foreign countries to grow our business these markets are rapidly evolving and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely used or accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance or adoption of our services in these markets include the following 



 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer lower demand for our products reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market position we must continually improve our access to technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or potentially launch entirely new products and services such as new gtlds in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish an online presence we have been designated as the registry operator for certain new gtlds including certain idn gtlds however there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be as or more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the new gtlds including our new gtlds may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and developers of desktop and mobile device software may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn gtlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well as a result of these challenges it is possible that resolution of domain names within some of these new gtlds may be blocked within certain state or organizational environments challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability on the internet 

see the “competition” section in part i item 1 for further information 

we must establish and maintain strong relationships with registrars and their resellers to maintain their focus on marketing our products and services otherwise our business could be harmed 

all of our domain name registrations occur through registrars registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names as well as their own associated offerings consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars have chosen to and may continue to choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms our registrars and resellers sell domain name registrations of other competing registries including other new gtlds and some also sell and support their own services for websites such as email website hosting as well as other services therefore our registrars and resellers may be more motivated to sell to registrants to whom they can also market their own services to the extent that registrars and their resellers focus more on selling and supporting their services and less on the registration and renewal of domain names in our tlds our revenues could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully market our services to and build and maintain strong relationships with new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent if we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling registrations of domain names in our tlds as opposed to other competing tlds including the new gtlds or their own services our business could be harmed 

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our owned data centers in 2019 we began transitioning some of our data center operations to a leased data center facility we are also updating our network architecture in several of our new and existing data centers to the extent our data center facilities or the updated network architecture do not operate as expected we could experience service interruptions or outages which could harm our business also to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to our primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for such interruptions 

in addition our services depend on the secure and efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the secure and efficient operation of internet service providers internet exchange point operators and internet backbone service providers such providers have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control and may continue to encounter problems and outages in addition if the providers that our connections depend upon do not protect maintain improve and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the dns through their networks our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation or update of the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers or the tld zone files that we operate including for example our operation of the gov registry or other network functions could result in a dns resolution or other service outage or degradation the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet the deletion of one or more secondlevel domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the operation or update of the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could result in similar consequences a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register or maintain domain names for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services in conformance with industry best practices the failure could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period any of these problems or outages could create potential liability and exposure including from a failure to meet our service level agreements in our registry agreements and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the reliability of our services or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social public health and political conditions 

an unfavorable global market economic social and political environment has impacted or may negatively impact among other things 



 in addition to the extent that the market economic social public health and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many endusers of our products and services are concentrated such as china that may have a disproportionate negative impact on our business 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic legal regulatory and political risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the us our business operations in international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could materially harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business internationally including among others 

 we rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internallydeveloped technologies and related intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same 

extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the ietf to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” in some cases we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

we also license externallydeveloped technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions these externallydeveloped technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate verisign in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold in addition in the us and most other countries word marks solely for tlds have currently not been successfully registered as trademarks accordingly we may not be able to fully realize or maintain the value of these intellectual property assets 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

we cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of other parties the international use of our logo could present additional potential risks for external party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

an external party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses including patents related to software and business methods are uncertain and evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits audits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits audits and investigations litigation is inherently unpredictable and unexpected judgments or excessive verdicts do occur in addition such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material adverse outcomes in lawsuits audits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business such as our ability 

to operate the  web gtld and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such claims lawsuits audits and investigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we explore possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the investment in and the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio backend registry services and idn gtlds in addition we have evaluated and are pursuing and will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions of tlds that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded or delegated as long as they support our growth strategy 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel possible regulatory scrutiny or thirdparty claims possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative as well as damage to our reputation if we are unsuccessful in pursuing a strategic initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net name and other tlds including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review or icann determines that such a review is required we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all any strategic initiative to leverage our patent portfolio will likely increase litigation risks from potential licensees and we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we operate in a unique competitive and highly regulated environment and we depend on the knowledge experience and performance of our senior management team and other key employees in this regard and otherwise we periodically experience changes in our management team if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these key individuals as well as other highly skilled employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer for example our service products are highly technical and require individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique platforms operating systems and software development tools 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis because of a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure changes in tax laws that could adversely impact our income or nonincome taxes or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions for example we claimed a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return and recorded a net income tax benefit of 3801 million although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has released plans to issue a final report by the end of 2020 that will provide a longterm multilateral proposal on the taxation of the digital economy if this proposal is ultimately agreed to and implemented by the member states there could be significant modifications in the way multinational corporations are taxed in addition some international tax jurisdictions have or may independently of the oecd enact new tax regimes aimed at income resulting from digital services although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such changes or the likelihood of such proposals being adopted legislatively throughout the world and tax treaties being modified 

accordingly any or all of these changes in tax policy for the digital economy could increase our taxes and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

as of december 31 2019 we had 123 billion in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 7099 million was invested in marketable securities the cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by financial market credit and liquidity events if the global credit or liquidity market deteriorates or other events negatively impact the market for us treasury securities our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in dulles virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including 

 we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for an outside party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder which generally means a person who together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of outstanding debt and we periodically reassess our capital structure and may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness including any future indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations or to arrange alternative liquidity sources to make principal and interest payments when due or to repurchase or settle our debt if triggered by certain corporate events or certain events of default it could also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry or make required capital expenditures and investments in our business make it difficult or more expensive to refinance our debt or obtain new debt trigger an event of default and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions some of our debt contains covenants which may limit our operating flexibility including restrictions on share repurchases dividends prepayment or repurchase of debt acquisitions disposing of assets if we do not continue to meet certain financial ratios any rating assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency which could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition

legal proceedings

we are also involved in various investigations claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business none of which in our opinion will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any litigation regardless of the outcome any litigation may require us to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention

overview 

we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet infrastructure enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names we enable the security stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services including providing root zone maintainer services operating two of the 13 global internet root servers and providing registration services and authoritative resolution for the  com and  net toplevel domains which support the majority of global ecommerce 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 1588 million  com and  net registrations in the domain name base the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors including overall economic conditions competition from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals 

2019 business highlights and trends 



critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  income taxes 

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

our revenues are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds and from providing backend registry services to a number of tld registry operators all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with registrars or their resellers and the registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars the annual fee for a com domain name registration has been fixed at 

785 since 2012 on october 26 2018 we entered into an agreement with the doc to amend the cooperative agreement the amendment extends the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 and permits the price of a com domain name to be increased without further doc approval by up to 7 in each of the final four years of each sixyear period beginning on october 26 2018 we increased the annual fee for a net domain name registration from 820 to 902 on february 1 2018 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our agreement with icann through june 30 2023 we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for  com and  net registrations are in us dollars 

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares the  com and net domain name registrations in the domain name base   



growth in the domain name base has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars however competitive pressure from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants managing their investment in domain names and historical global economic uncertainty has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2020 and beyond 

revenues increased by 167 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in revenues from the operation of the registries for the com and net tlds partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the security services business as customers terminated or consented to the assignment of their contracts to neustar the increase in revenues from the com and net tlds was driven by a 5 increase in registrations in the domain name base for com and the increase in the net domain name registration fees in february 2018 partially offset by a 4 decline in registrations in the domain name base for net  

geographic revenues 

we generate revenues in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” china and certain other countries including canada australia and japan   the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues in the table above are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region the majority of our revenue growth in 2019 has come from increased sales to registrars based in the us and china revenues in the us and emea regions in particular were impacted by the decrease in revenues from our security services business as customers terminated or consented to the assignment of their contracts to neustar 

we expect revenues will continue to grow in 2020 as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2019 and continued growth in registrations in the domain name base in 2020 partially offset by the elimination of revenue from the customers of our security services business that had not yet consented to the assignment of their contracts to neustar 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  



cost of revenues decreased by 117 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses telecommunications expenses and depreciation expenses salary and benefits expenses decreased by 55 million due to a reduction in average headcount primarily related to employees supporting the divested security services business telecommunications expenses decreased by 51 million as a result of lower costs to support our operations depreciation expenses decreased by 20 million as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures in recent years 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



sales and marketing expenses decreased by 183 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses advertising and marketing expenses and allocated overhead expenses salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 91 million due to a reduction in average headcount primarily affecting employees supporting the divested security services business advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 44 million as we executed fewer marketing activities and campaigns allocated overhead expenses decreased by 27 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount relative to other cost types 

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



research and development expenses increased by 29 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in capitalized labor and an increase in allocated overhead expenses capitalized labor decreased by 25 million due to a shift in work from capital projects to certain noncapital projects and maintenance of existing software products allocated overhead expenses increased by 20 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount relative to other cost types 

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees and certain tax and license fees offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

general and administrative expenses increased by 50 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses and software license expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 28 million due to an increase in average headcount and annual salary increases software license expenses increased by 24 million resulting from costs related to certain security initiatives 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 

interest expense 

see note 4 “debt and interest expense” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we expect interest expense to remain consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 

nonoperating income net 

see note 9 “nonoperating income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we expect nonoperating income net to decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to income from the transition services provided to neustar in 2019 in connection with the sale of customer contracts of our security services business and a decrease in interest income resulting from a decline in interest rates 

income tax expense 

the effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were lower than the statutory federal rate of 21 due to a lower foreign effective tax rate and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation partially offset by state income taxes us taxes on our foreign earnings and accrual for uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2019  we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 948 million  net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign nol carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 

we qualified for a tax holiday in switzerland until the end of 2019 which lowered tax rates on certain types of income and required certain thresholds of foreign source income the tax holiday reduced our foreign income tax expense by 173 million 015 per share and 169 million 014 per share in 2019 and 2018 respectively the benefit from the tax holiday is calculated before consideration of any offsetting tax impact in the united states effective january 1 2020 due to swiss tax law changes the tax holiday was eliminated which was partially offset by a lowered statutory tax rate 

we expect the effective tax rate for 2020 to be between 18 and 21 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2019  our principal source of liquidity was 5082 million of cash and cash equivalents and 7099 million of marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days as of december 31 2019  all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible following the tax cuts and jobs act we have greater flexibility in accessing the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “financial instruments” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2019  we repurchased 39 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 18884 for an aggregate cost of 7385 million under our share repurchase program in 2018  we repurchased 44 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 13786 for an aggregate cost of 6000 million effective february 6 2020 our board authorized the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of 7430 million in addition to the 2570 million that remained available for repurchases under the share repurchase program for a total repurchase authorization of up to 10 billion under the program 

as of december 31 2019 we had 5500 million principal amount outstanding of 475 senior unsecured notes due 2027 5000 million principal amount outstanding of the 525 senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 7500 million principal amount outstanding of the 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2023 in december 2019 we entered into a new 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility this facility will expire in 2024 and takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 

in 2018 we settled our subordinated convertible debentures with the 125 billion principal value paid in cash and 261 million shares of common stock issued for the conversion spread 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2019  2018  and 2017 were as follows 

cash flows from operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and a decrease in cash paid for interest partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes cash received from customers increased primarily due to higher domain name registrations and renewals the decrease in cash paid for interest on our debt obligations was primarily due to the settlement of our subordinated convertible debentures in may 2018 the increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to by higher us federal income tax payments in 2019 partially offset by the 607 million of foreign withholding taxes paid on the repatriation of 115 billion cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the us in the first quarter of 2018 

cash flows from investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities purchases of property and equipment and the sale of businesses 

  

net cash provided by investing activities decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases proceeds from the sale of businesses and an increase in purchases of property and equipment 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from and repayment of borrowings and our employee stock purchase plan “espp” 

  

net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the repayment of the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures during 2018 partially offset by an increase in share repurchases 

impact of inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented 

income taxes 

  

we expect cash paid for income taxes in 2020 to approximate our income tax expenses for the year 

property and equipment expenditures 

  our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2020 are anticipated to be between 450 million and 550 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 11 “commitments and contingencies” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k   

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2019  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 11 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

dilution from rsus 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2019  there are a total of 09 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of less than 10 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2019  we had 104 billion of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business in several countries and transact in multiple foreign currencies the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the us dollar our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2019  we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 263 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

  market risk management 

the fair market values of our senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2019  the fair values of the senior notes issued in 2013 2015 and 2017 were 7628 million  5523 million  and 5819 million  respectively based on available market information from public data sources

registry services 

  

registry services operates the authoritative directory of andor the backend systems for all com net cc tv gov jobs 

edu and  name  domain names among others registry services allows individuals and organizations to establish their online identities while providing the secure alwayson access they need to communicate and transact reliably with largescale online audiences 

  

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net  and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” among others under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com  agreement the us department of commerce “doc” we are also the exclusive registry of domain names within certain transliterations of com  and net  in a number of different native languages and scripts “idn gtlds” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names eg johndoecom and janedoenet in these gtlds and idn gtlds our global constellation of dns servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows icannaccredited registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into central directories and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

in addition to our registry agreements with icann we have agreements to operate the registry for the tv  and cc  country code toplevel domains “cctlds” for tuvalu and cocos keeling islands respectively and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs  and edu sponsored tlds among others these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of dns servers and shared registration system 

  

we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language our gtlds and cctlds can support standardscompliant registrations in over 100 different native languages and scripts 

we also perform the root zone maintainer function under an agreement with icann for the core of the internet’s dns and operate two of the 13 root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy 

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years the fees charged for com  net and  name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc  and tv  domain names and our idn gtlds are based on a similar fee system and registration system although the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by the doc on com  or icann with respect to net and  name  the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure and that of others for which verisign provides such services are based on the terms of verisign’s agreements with those respective registry operators  

historically we have experienced a higher volume of domain name transactions in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance the effect of this seasonality has historically resulted in the largest amount of growth in our deferred revenue balance occurring during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters 

  

security services 

  

as described above the company sold its security services customer contracts to neustar on december 5 2018 security services was primarily comprised of ddos protection services and managed dns services 

ddos protection services supports online business continuity by providing monitoring and mitigation services against ddos attacks customers include financial institutions softwareasaservice providers ecommerce providers and media companies customers pay a subscription fee that varies depending on the customer’s network requirements 

  

managed dns services is a hosting service that delivers dns resolution improving the availability of webbased systems customers include financial institutions ecommerce and softwareasaservice providers customers pay a subscription fee that varies based on the amount of dns traffic they receive 

operations infrastructure 

our operations infrastructure consists of three secure data centers in dulles virginia new castle delaware and fribourg switzerland as well as more than 160 resolution sites around the world our domain name servers provide the associated authoritative name servers and ip addresses for every com  and net  domain name on the internet and a large number of other tld queries processing more than 152 billion queries daily these secure data centers operate 24 hours a day supporting our business units and services the performance and scale of our infrastructure are critical for our business and give us the platform to maintain our leadership position key features of our operations infrastructure include 

  

   

   

 

   

we have continuously expanded our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to address projected internet attack trends 

  

call centers and help desk we provide customer support services through phonebased call centers email help desks and webbased selfhelp systems our virginia call center is staffed with trained customer support agents 24 hours a day every day of the year 

  

operations support and monitoring through our network operations center we have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical database systems and our global resolution systems our network operations center is staffed 24 hours a day every day of the year 

  

disaster recovery plans we have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities we maintain dual mirrored data centers that allow rapid failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity as well as offcontinent tertiary facilities our critical data services including domain name registration and global resolution use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as synchronous mirroring and remote replication 

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we seek to expand our business through focused marketing campaigns and programs that target growth in the com and net  domain name base both domestically and in foreign markets we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we provide tools to be used by both registrars and end users to allow them to find relevant domain names we have marketing and sales offices in several countries around the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and new and enhanced ways to ensure the security stability and resiliency of our services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace 

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in the registry services business the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration establish an online presence as well as other uses of domain names such as branded email in addition to the gtlds and cctlds we operate or for which we provide backend registry services there are over 1200 other operational gtld registries over 250 latin script cctld registries more than 50 idn cctld registries and over 150 idn gtld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and other gtlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media or transact on ecommerce platforms as opposed to direct navigation we face competition from search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu social media networks such as facebook and wechat ecommerce platforms such as amazon ebay and taobao and microblogging tools such as twitter in addition we face competition from these social media businesses and ecommerce platforms if they are used to establish an online presence by endusers rather than through the use of a domain name furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and mobile applications to locate and access content we face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to registries that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among our competitors are afilias plc centralnic ltd and neustar inc 

industry regulation 

  

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit the multistakeholder process has and will continue to create policies programs and standards that directly or indirectly impact or affect our business in addition countrylevel regulations such as those implemented by china impose additional costs on our registry services can affect the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations and may also affect our ability to do business similarly in the european union legislative and regulatory bodies responsible for data privacy continue to enhance and modify data privacy protections which impacts our collection and delivery of personal data as we provide our domain name registry services and could affect costs of operation 

as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com and net gtlds we have entered into certain agreements with icann and in the case of  com  the doc under a cooperative agreement 

  

com registry agreement   

following the extension of the com  registry agreement on october 20 2016 the com  registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com  gtld through november 30 2024 as part of the extension of the com  registry agreement the company and icann agreed to cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the com  registry agreement i by october 20 2018 to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the internet or the com tld and ii as may be necessary for consistency with changes to or the termination or expiration of the cooperative agreement icann and verisign are engaged in discussions related to these obligations including modifying the  com  registry agreement based on changes to the cooperative agreement arising from amendment 35 on a quarterly basis we pay 025 to icann for each annual increment of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter we are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies as well as other provisions pursuant to the com  registry agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations the com  registry agreement also provides a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve additional registry services 

the com  and net  registry agreements with icann contain a “presumptive” right of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms icann could terminate or refuse to renew our  com  andor net registry agreements if upon proper notice i we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and ii we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court see “risk factors  risks arising from our agreements governing our registry services business could limit our ability to maintain or grow our business” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information our com  and net  registry agreements contain obligations to provide access to our systems restrictions on our ability to market and bundle our products and services and restrictions on our ability to control our registrar channel or own a registrar 

cooperative agreement 

verisign and the doc entered into amendment 35 of the cooperative agreement on october 26 2018 which among other items extends the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 the cooperative agreement will automatically renew on the same terms for successive sixyear terms unless the doc provides written notice of nonrenewal 120 days prior to the end of the thencurrent term under amendment 35 standard renewals of the  com  registry agreement with icann will not require further doc approval although any additional changes to the pricing section other than as approved in amendment 35 changes to the vertical integration provisions the functional or performance specifications including the slas the conditions for renewal or termination or to the whois service as set forth in the amendment 35 would require further doc approval as was the case with prior amendments the doc’s approval of amendment 35 was not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on verisign with respect to the  com  registry agreement 

under amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement the maximum price as defined in the com  registry agreement of a com  domain name may be increased without further doc approval by up to 7 in each of the final four years of each sixyear period the first such sixyear period begins on october 26 2018 the changes to the maximum price under amendment 35 are not effective until such price increases are incorporated in the com  registry agreement with icann further we are entitled to increase the maximum price of a com  domain name due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security or stability of the dns as described in the com  registry agreement provided that we may not exercise such right unless the doc provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest such approval not to be unreasonably withheld the cooperative agreement further provides that we shall be entitled at any time during the term of the com  registry agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the com  registry agreement if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the com  registry agreement as determined by the doc also under amendment 35 we clarified that the restrictions in the com  registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the  com  tld as to the  com  tld we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar that sells  com  domain names in addition under amendment 35 we have agreed to continue to operate the  com  tld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of contentneutral policies for the operation of the dns 

net registry agreement 

we entered into a renewal of our  net  registry agreement with icann that was effective on july 1 2017 the net  registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the net  tld through june 30 2023 

  root zone maintainer service agreement 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we entered into a new agreement with icann the root zone maintainer service agreement “rzma” under which we perform the root zone maintainer functions on behalf of icann the rzma will expire on october 19 2024 with an automatic renewal unless earlier terminated

  we have been issued numerous patents in the us and abroad covering a wide range of our technologies additionally we continue to file numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technologies in the us patent and trademark office and internationally patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide sufficient protection of our intellectual property we continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for the verisign mark and verisign logo in the us and certain countries and have pending trademark applications for the verisign logo in a number of other countries we have common law rights in other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services 

  

our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our registry services business and certain methodologies many of which are patented or for which patent applications are pending and technical expertise and proprietary knowhow we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services we own our proprietary shared registration system through which registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors and some are based on open standards set by organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standard essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function 



we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 




 item 1a   risk factors 

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

risks arising from our agreements governing our registry services business could limit our ability to maintain or grow our business 

we are parties to i a cooperative agreement as amended with the doc with respect to the  com  gtld and ii registry agreements with icann for com  net name and other gtlds including our idn gtlds as substantially all of our revenues are derived from our registry services business limitations and obligations in or changes or challenges to these agreements particularly the agreements that involve  com  and  net  could have a material adverse impact on our business certain competing registries such as the cctlds do not face the same limitations or obligations that we face in our agreements verisign and the doc entered into amendment 35 of the cooperative agreement on october 26 2018 which among other items extends the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 the cooperative agreement will automatically renew on the same terms for successive sixyear terms unless the doc provides written notice of nonrenewal 120 days prior to the end of the thencurrent term further changes to the cooperative agreement require the mutual agreement of the doc and the company 

modifications or amendments  in october 2016 the company and icann entered into an amendment to extend the term of the com  registry agreement to november 30 2024 the “ com  amendment” as part of the com amendment the company and icann agreed to negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the com  registry agreement i by october 20 2018 to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the internet or the com tld and ii as may be necessary for consistency with changes to or the termination or expiration of the cooperative agreement icann and verisign are engaged in discussions to satisfy this obligation including modifying the  com  registry agreement based on changes to the cooperative agreement arising from amendment 35 we can provide no assurance that any new terms for the com  registry agreement that we agree to as a result of these discussions will match the changes permitted in amendment 35 nor can we provide assurances that certain terms that we agree to will not increase the costs or risks associated with the operation of the  com  tld under amendment 35 standard renewals of the  com  registry agreement will not require further doc approval if in connection with a renewal of the com registry agreement the company seeks any additional changes to the pricing section other than as approved in amendment 35 changes to the vertical integration provisions the functional or performance specifications including the slas the conditions for renewal or termination or to the whois service as set forth in the amendment 35 doc approval is required we can provide no assurances that such approval would be obtained 

in addition our registry agreements for new gtlds including the registry agreements for our idn gtlds include icann’s right to amend the agreements without our consent which could impose unfavorable contract obligations on us that could impact our plans and competitive positions with respect to new gtlds at the time of renewal of our com  or net  registry agreements icann might also attempt to impose this same unilateral right to amend these registry agreements under certain conditions icann has also included new mandatory obligations on new gtld registry operators including us that may increase the risks and potential liabilities associated with operating new gtlds icann might seek to impose these new mandatory obligations in our other registry agreements under certain conditions we can provide no assurance that any changes to our registry agreements as a result of the above obligations will not have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

pricing  under the terms of amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement the company and icann may agree to amend the terms of the  com  registry agreement to permit the price of registrations or renewals of  com  domain names to be increased by up to 7 per year in each of the final four years of each sixyear period beginning on october 26 2018 in addition we are entitled to increase the price up to 7 with the prior approval of the doc due to the imposition of any new icann consensus policies as established and defined under icann’s bylaws and due process and covering certain items listed in the  com  registry agreement or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the dns however it is uncertain that these additional circumstances will arise or if they do whether we would seek or the doc would approve any request to increase the price for com  domain name registrations we also have the right under the cooperative agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions however it is uncertain whether we will seek the removal of such restrictions or whether the doc would approve the removal of such restrictions in comparison under the terms of the net  and name  registry agreements with icann we are permitted to increase the price of domain name registrations and renewals in these tlds up to 10 per year additionally icann’s registry agreements for new gtlds do not contain such pricing restrictions 

vertical integration  under amendment 35 the parties clarified that the restrictions in the com  registry agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the  com  tld as to the  com  tld we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar that sells  com  domain name registrations historically all gtld registry operators were subject to a vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal for certain other registry operators additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities if we seek to remove the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements it is uncertain whether icann approval would be obtained furthermore even if we obtain such approval we can provide no assurances that we will enter the domain name retail market or that we will be successful if we choose to do so if registry operators of other tlds including cctlds are able to obtain competitive advantages through vertical integration and we are not it could materially harm our business 

renewal and termination  our  com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann contain “presumptive” rights of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms on november 30 2024 june 30 2023 and august 15 2020 respectively the registry agreements for our new gtlds including our idn gtlds are subject to a 10year term and contain similar “presumptive” renewal rights if certain terms in our com  and net  registry agreements are not similar to such terms generally in effect in the registry agreements of the five largest gtlds then a renewal of these agreements shall be upon terms reasonably necessary to render such terms similar to the registry agreements for those other gtlds there can be no assurance that such terms if they apply will not have a material adverse impact on our business a failure by icann to approve the renewal of the com  registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2024 or to approve the renewal of the  net  registry agreement prior to or upon the expiration of its current term on june 30 2023 would have absent an extension a material adverse effect on our business icann could terminate or refuse to renew our  com  or  net  registry agreements if upon proper notice i we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and ii we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court icann’s termination or refusal to renew either the  com  or  net  registry agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business 

consensus policies  our registry agreements with icann require us to implement consensus policies and specifications or policies established on a temporary basis “temporary policies” icann could adopt consensus policies or temporary policies that are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of com  net and our other   gtlds that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position such consensus policies or temporary policies could have a material adverse effect on our business as an example icann has adopted a consensus policy that requires verisign to receive and display thick whois data for com  and  net  in addition icann has adopted a temporary specification that establishes temporary requirements for registry operators and registrars regarding the collection display and disclosure of thick whois data pending icann’s establishment of a permanent consensus policy the costs of complying or failing to comply with these policies as well as laws and regulations such as general data protection regulation “gdpr” regarding personally identifiable information and data privacy such as domestic and various foreign privacy regimes could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

technical standards and icann processes   our registry agreements with icann require verisign to implement and comply with various technical standards and specifications published by the internet engineering task force “ietf” icann could impose requirements on us through changes to these ietf standards that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position any such changes to the ietf standards could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition under amendment 35 we have agreed to continue to operate the  com  tld in a contentneutral manner and to work within icann processes to promote the development of content neutral policies for the operation of the dns such policies could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

legal challenges  our registry agreements have faced and could face in the future challenges including possible legal challenges resulting from our activities or the activities of icann registrars registrants and others and any adverse outcome from such challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and overseas may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or overseas to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation for example the government of china has indicated that it will issue and in some instances has begun to issue new regulations and has begun to enforce existing regulations that impose additional costs on and risks to our provision of 

registry services in china and could impact the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations in china in addition to registry operators certain of such regulations also require registrars to obtain a governmentissued license for each tld whose domain name registrations they intend to sell directly to registrants any failure to obtain the required licenses or to comply with any license requirements or any updates thereto by us or our registrars could impact the growth of our business in china 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names online gambling counterfeit goods and intellectual property violations such as cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 

to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and receive data originating from different jurisdictions and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s gdpr which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and significant penalties became effective in may 2018 other countries and other states have enacted or are enacting data localization laws regulating or limiting data collection storage and transfer all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements can impose significant costs for us that are likely to increase over time 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that federal state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified or enforced using new or novel legal theories and new laws may be enacted in the future in addition as we continue to launch our idn gtlds and increase our marketing efforts of our other tlds in foreign countries we may raise our profile in certain foreign countries thereby increasing the regulatory and other scrutiny of our operations any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation expose us to liability penalties or fines force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations 

undetected or unknown defects in our service security breaches defects in the technologies and services in our supply chain and ddos attacks could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in service outages compromised customer data including dns data diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs any of which could harm our business performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as more broadly on internet users and consumers and on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security vulnerabilities and breaches or our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues failure to meet contracted service level obligations loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

in addition to undetected defects or errors we are also subject to cyberattacks and attempted security breaches we retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems it is critical to our business strategy as well as fulfilling our obligations as the registry operator for com  and net  that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure that we continue to meet our service level agreements and we maintain the public’s trust in the internet services that we provide the company as an operator of critical internet infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat attacks and zerohour threats these forms of attacks involve situations where the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched in addition these forms of attacks may target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist only within the target’s supply chain or operating environment making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against in addition to external threats we may be subject to insider threats including those from thirdparty suppliers such as consultants and advisors saas providers hardware software and network systems manufacturers and other outside vendors or from current or former contractors or employees these threats can be realized from intentional or unintentional actions the shared registration system the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers and the tld zone files that we operate are critical to our registry services operations therefore attacks against thirdparty suppliers that provide services to our registry services operations could also impact our infrastructure despite the significant time and money expended on our security measures we have been subject to a security breach as disclosed in our quarterly report on form 

10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins disruptions resulting from destructive malware hardware or enabling software defects computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may cause an outage of or jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability fail to meet contracted service level obligations customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for operation of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business or cause financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance that we maintain such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

we use externally developed technology systems and services including both hardware and software for a variety of purposes including without limitation compute storage encryption and authentication backoffice support and other functions while we have developed operational policies and procedures to reduce the impact of security vulnerabilities in system components as well as at any vendors where company data is stored or processed such measures cannot provide absolute security vulnerabilities in and exploits leading to breaches of our vendors’ technology systems or services could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of company data including but not limited to sensitive personally identifiable information 

additionally our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks recent attacks have demonstrated that ddos attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication and have an ability to widely disrupt internet services particularly since 2016 the size of ddos attacks has grown rapidly and we have successfully mitigated ddos attacks during this time frame that are significantly larger than those we have historically experienced while we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against such attacks there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any attack even if only partially successful could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our contracted service level obligations and generally hamper our ability to provide reliable service to our registry services customers and the broader internet community we have historically incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to enable our infrastructure to process levels of attack traffic that are significant multiples of our normal transaction volume further we are in the process of transitioning our security services customer contracts to neustar during this migration period we will continue to operate ddos protection services for customers that have yet to transition these ddos protection services share some of the infrastructure used in our registry services business therefore the operation of such services might expose our critical registry services infrastructure to temporary degradations or outages caused by ddos attacks against those customers in addition to any attacks directed specifically against us and our networks 

changes to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations 

role of the us government  in the fourth quarter of 2016 the united states government completed a transition to the multistakeholder community of the historical role played by the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” in the coordination of the dns changes arising from this transition to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business for example icann has adopted bylaws that are designed in part to enhance accountability through a new organization called the empowered community which is comprised of a cross section of stakeholders icann or the empowered community may assert positions that could negatively impact our strategy or our business 

by completing the transition discussed above the us government through the ntia has ended its coordination and management of important aspects of the dns including the iana functions and the root zone there can be no assurance that the removal of the us government oversight of these key functions will not negatively impact our business 

role of icann  icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit if icann or the empowered community fails to uphold or significantly redefines the multistakeholder model it could harm our business additionally the empowered community could adversely impact icann which could negatively impact its ability to coordinate the multistakeholder system of governance or negatively affect our interests also legal regulatory or other challenges could be brought challenging the legal authority underlying the roles and actions of icann the empowered community or us 

role of foreign governments  some governments and members of the multistakeholder community have questioned icann’s role with respect to internet governance and as a result could seek a multilateral oversight body as a replacement additionally the role of icann’s governmental advisory committee which is comprised of representatives of national governments could change and give governments more control of certain aspects of internet governance some governments and governmental authorities outside the us have in the past disagreed and may in the future disagree with the actions policies or programs of icann the us government and us relating to the dns changes to the roles that foreign governments play in internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

we face risks from our operation of two root zone servers and performance of the root zone maintainer functions under the rzma 

we operate two of the 13 root zone servers root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and dns configuration data necessary to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet we also have an important operational role in support of a key iana function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative root zone data and make it available to all root server operators under an agreement with icann the root zone maintainer service agreement “rzma” 

as we perform the root zone maintainer services under the rzma we may be subject to significant claims challenging the agreement or our performance under the agreement and we may not have immunity from or sufficient indemnification or insurance for such claims 

for example dnssec enabled in the root zone and at other levels of the dns requires new preventative maintenance including root key signing key “ksk” rollover necessitating functions and complex operational practices that did not exist prior to the introduction of dnssec any failure by us icann external dns vendors and service providers or other relying parties to comply with stated practices such as those outlined in relevant dnssec practice statements and internet standards introduces risk to dnssec relying parties and other internet users and consumers of the dns which could have a material adverse impact on our business in particular because root ksk rollover involves updates to the ksk public key the “trust anchor” and private key pair managed by icann’s public technical identifiers pti operation to the root zone dnssec records published by us in our role as root zone maintainer and to corresponding trust anchor configurations maintained by external dns vendors and service providers’ dnssecaware implementations if such external parties are not adequately prepared for andor do not appropriately effectuate root key updates any root ksk rollover including the initial rollover that occurred on october 11 2018 at icann’s direction may introduce substantial risk to relying parties even where we have correctly implemented our key updates we could face potential legal claims and reputational harm if the failures described occur 

additionally over 1200 new gtlds have already been delegated into the root zone in the current round of new gtlds icann plans on offering a subsequent round of new gtlds the timing of which remains uncertain we believe there are potential security and stability issues that could involve the root zone and at other levels of the dns from the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our and others’ efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all for example domain name collisions have been reported to icann which have resulted in various network interruptions for enterprises as well as confusion and usability issues that have led to phishing and other cyberattacks it is anticipated that as additional new gtlds are delegated now or in subsequent rounds more domain name collisions and associated security issues will occur 

the evolution of internet practices and behaviors and the adoption of substitute technologies may impact the demand for domain names 

domain names and the domain name system have been used by consumers and businesses to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity for many years the growth of technologies such as social media mobile devices apps and the dominance of search engines has evolved and changed the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses alike these changes can impact the demand for domain names by those who purchase domain names for personal commercial and investment reasons factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will monetize their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business some domain name registrars and registrants seek to purchase and resell domain names at an increased price adverse changes in the resale value of domain names changes in the business models for such domain name registrars and registrants or other factors could result in a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for domain names in our tlds the resulting decrease in demand andor renewal rates could negatively impact the volume of new domain name registrations our renewal rates and our associated revenue growth 

some domain name registrants use a domain name to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a 

web browser the use of an app on their smart phone or mobile device the use of a voice recognition technology such as alexa cortana google assistant or siri or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet users’ preferences or practices shift away from recognizing and relying on web addresses for navigation through the use of new and existing technologies iii internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content iv internet users were to significantly decrease the use of domain names to develop and protect their online identity or v internet users were to increasingly use third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names in our tlds could decrease this may trigger current or prospective customers and parties in our target markets to reevaluate their need for registration or renewal of domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo baidu and bing have and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past changed and may change in the future its search algorithm which may decrease site traffic to certain websites and provide less payperclick compensation for certain types of websites this has made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

if any of the above factors negatively impact the renewal of domain names or the demand for new domain names we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

many of our markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

we seek to serve many new developing and emerging markets in foreign countries to grow our business these markets are rapidly evolving and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely used or accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance or adoption of our services in these markets include the following 

 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer lower demand for our products reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market position we must continually improve our access to technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or potentially launch entirely new products and services such as new 

gtlds in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish a web presence we have been designated as the registry operator for certain new gtlds including certain idn gtlds however there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be as or more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the new gtlds including our new gtlds may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and developers of desktop and mobile device software may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn gtlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well as a result of these challenges it is possible that resolution of domain names within some of these new gtlds may be blocked within certain state or organizational environments challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability on the internet 

see the “competition” section in part i item 1 for further information 

we must establish and maintain strong relationships with registrars and their resellers to maintain their focus on marketing our products and services otherwise our registry services business could be harmed 

all of our domain name registrations occur through registrars registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names as well as their own associated offerings consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars have chosen to and may continue to choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms our registrars and resellers sell domain name registrations of other competing registries including the new gtlds and some also sell and support their own services for websites such as email website hosting as well as other services therefore our registrars and resellers may be more motivated to sell to registrants to whom they can also market their own services to the extent that registrars and their resellers focus more on selling and supporting their services and less on the registration and renewal of domain names in our tlds our revenues could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully market our services to and build and maintain strong relationships with new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent if we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling registrations of domain names in our tlds as opposed to other competing tlds including the new gtlds or their own services our business could be harmed 

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 



 most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland in 2019 we will begin transitioning some of our data center operations to a leased data center facility in ashburn virginia to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to our primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for such interruptions or for potential losses arising from terrorism 

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the secure and efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the secure and efficient operation of internet service providers internet exchange point operators and internet backbone service providers some or all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control in addition if these service providers do not protect maintain improve and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the dns through their networks our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation or update of the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers or the tld zone files that we operate including for example our operation of the gov  registry or other network functions could result in a dns resolution or other service outage or degradation the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet the deletion of one or more secondlevel domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the operation or update of the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could result in similar consequences a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register or maintain domain names for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services in conformance with industry best practices the failure could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period any of these problems or outages could create potential liability and exposure including from a failure to meet our service level agreements in our registry agreements and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the reliability of our services or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

an unfavorable global market economic social and political environment has impacted or may negatively impact among other things 

 in addition to the extent that the market economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many endusers of our products are concentrated that may have a disproportionate negative impact on our business 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic legal and political risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the us our business operations in international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets 

failure to do so could materially harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

 we rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” in some cases we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

we also license externally developed technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions these externally developed technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our registry services business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate verisign in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or 

enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold in addition in the us and most other countries word marks solely for tlds have currently not been successfully registered as trademarks accordingly we may not be able to fully realize or maintain the value of these intellectual property assets 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

we cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of other parties the international use of our logo could present additional potential risks for external party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

an external party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses including patents related to software and business methods are uncertain and evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits audits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits audits and investigations for example afilias a competitor and a losing bidder in the  web  auction filed an arbitration proceeding against icann on november 14 2018 alleging that icann’s failure to disqualify nu dotco llc “ndc” from participating in the web  auction violated icann’s rules the arbitration which was filed more than two years after the  web  auction took place seeks to compel icann to award the  web  tld to afilias neither verisign nor ndc currently are parties in the afilias arbitration but both have filed requests to participate in the arbitration as interested parties as allowed by icann’s rules we believe afilias’ claims against icann are without merit if afilias were successful in the arbitration on its claims that icann violated its own rules we believe that icann would still need to make a further determination to remedy such a violation nevertheless it is possible that afilias or another party could potentially become the operator of the  web  tld 

litigation is inherently unpredictable and unexpected judgments or excessive verdicts do occur in addition such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material adverse outcomes in lawsuits audits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business such as our ability to obtain the  web  gtld and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such claims lawsuits audits and investigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we explore possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the investment in and the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio backend registry services and idn gtlds in addition we have evaluated and are pursuing and will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions of tlds that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded or delegated as long as they support our growth strategy 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel including for example management involvement in the transition of security services customers to neustar possible regulatory scrutiny or thirdparty claims possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative as well as damage to our reputation if we are unsuccessful in pursuing a strategic initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net   name  and other tlds including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review or icann determines that such a review is required we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all any strategic initiative to leverage our patent portfolio will likely increase litigation risks from potential licensees and we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we operate in a unique competitive and highly regulated environment and we depend on the knowledge experience and performance of our senior management team and other key employees in this regard and otherwise we periodically experience changes in our management team if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these key individuals as well as other highly skilled employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer for example our service products are highly technical and require individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique platforms operating systems and software development tools 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis because of a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure changes in tax laws that could adversely impact our income or nonincome taxes or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions for example we claimed a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return and recorded a net income tax benefit of 3801 million although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act significantly revamped us taxation of corporations including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 a limitation on interest deductibility and a new tax regime for foreign earnings our decision to redeem the convertible debentures the new us taxes on accumulated and future foreign earnings other adverse changes resulting from the tax act or a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings might offset the benefit from the reduced tax rate and our future effective tax rates andor cash taxes may increase even significantly or not decrease much compared to recent or historical trends many of the provisions of the tax act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the irs or others some of the provisions of the tax act may be changed by a future congress or challenged by the world trade organization “wto” or be subject to trade or tax retaliation by other countries although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance or actions by a future congress wto or other countries they could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

as of december 31 2018 we had 128 billion  in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 9123 million  was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by financial market credit and liquidity events if the global credit or liquidity market deteriorates or other events negatively impact the market for us treasury securities our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in dulles virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including 

 we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for an outside party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of outstanding debt and we periodically reassess our capital structure and may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness including any future indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations or to arrange alternative liquidity sources to make principal and interest payments when due or to repurchase or settle our debt if triggered by certain corporate events or certain events of default it could also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry or make required capital expenditures and investments in our business make it difficult or more expensive to refinance our debt or obtain new debt trigger an event of default and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions some of our debt contains covenants which may limit our operating flexibility including restrictions on share repurchases dividends prepayment or repurchase of debt acquisitions disposing of assets if we do not continue to meet certain financial ratios any rating assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency which could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition

overview 

we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet infrastructure enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names verisign enables the security stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services including providing root zone maintainer services operating two of the 13 global internet root servers and providing registration services and authoritative resolution for the  com  and  net  toplevel domains which support the majority of global ecommerce on december 5 2018 we completed the sale of our rights economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our security services business which primarily consisted of ddos protection services and managed dns services to neustar as part of the transaction we will continue to support the security services customers during the transition to neustar over the course of 2019 revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 1530 million  com  and  net  registrations in the domain name base the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors including overall economic conditions competition from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals 

2018  business highlights and trends 



 critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  income taxes 

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to interpretation and application of the 2017 tax act and related irs guidance changes especially related to accumulated and ongoing foreign earnings the likelihood we would realize the benefits of carryforwards from net operating losses “nols” capital losses domestic andor foreign tax credits the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds and from providing backend registry services to a number of tld registry operators all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with registrars or their resellers and the registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars we increased the annual fee for a net domain name registration from 746 to 820 on february 1 2017 and from 820 to 902 on february 1 2018 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our agreement with icann through june 30 2023 the annual fee for a com domain name registration has been fixed at 785 since 2012 on october 26 2018 we entered into an agreement with the doc to amend the cooperative agreement the amendment extends the term of the cooperative agreement until november 30 2024 and permits the price of a com  domain name to be increased without further doc approval by up to 7 in each of the final four years of each 6year period beginning on october 26 2018 we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for  com and  net registrations are in us dollars revenues from security services were not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues 

  

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares the domain name base for  com  and net  managed by our registry services business   



growth in the domain name base has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars however competitive pressure from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants managing their investment in domain names and historical global economic uncertainty has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2019 and beyond 

2018 compared to 2017 revenues increased by 499 million  primarily due to a 5 increase in the domain name base for  com and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2017 and 2018 partially offset by a 4 decline in the domain name base for  net  

2017 compared to 2016 revenues increased by 229 million  primarily due to a 4 increase in the domain name base for  com and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2016 and 2017 partially offset by a 5 decline in the domain name base for  net  additionally 2016 revenue was elevated due to an increased volume of new domain name registrations primarily from our registrars in china during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 the volume of these new registrations was inconsistent and episodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016 reverted back to a more normalized registration pace a significant portion of these registrations did not renew upon expiration 

geographic revenues 

we generate revenue in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” china and certain other countries including canada australia and japan 

  the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues for our registry services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region the majority of our revenue growth in 2018 and 2017 has come from increased sales to us based registrars revenues from china in 2016 benefited from the increased volume of registrations in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 as discussed earlier however a significant portion of those registrations did not renew resulting in the decline in revenues from china in 2017 

we expect revenues will continue to grow in 2019 as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2018 and continued growth in the domain name base in 2019 partially offset by the decrease in revenues resulting from the sale of customer contracts of our security services business

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018 

interest expense 

see note 4 “debt and interest expense” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

we expect interest expense to decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the redemption of the subordinated convertible debentures in the second quarter of 2018 

nonoperating income net 

see note 10 “nonoperating income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

we expect nonoperating income net to decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the gain recognized in 2018 related to the sale of the customer contracts of our security services business 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 21 primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation partially offset by state taxes and the us income tax impact of our foreign earnings our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 in 2017 and 2016 primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation in 2017 partially offset by state income taxes our effective tax rate for 2017 was also impacted by the changes arising out of the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 

due to the change in tax law in 2017 we owe us federal taxes on our accumulated and future foreign earnings our 2017 income tax expense included a provisional 1624 million of expense related to the us tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a provisional 336 million deferred tax expense for foreign withholding tax on unremitted foreign earnings both net of related previously unrecognized foreign tax credits these tax expenses were offset by a tax benefit of 1868 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new us federal corporate tax rate of 21 which became effective on january 1 2018 for further discussion see note 11 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2018  we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 1157 million  net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign nol carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets total deferred tax assets decreased in 2018 primarily due to the usage of tax credit and nol carryforwards to offset 2018 taxable income 

we qualify for a tax holiday in switzerland which does not expire unless the required nonswiss income and expense thresholds are no longer met or there is a law change which eliminates the holiday the tax holiday provides reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also requires certain thresholds of foreign source income the tax holiday reduced the our income tax expense by 169 million in 2018 123 million in 2017 and 213 million in 2016 this resulted in an increase in earnings per share by 014   010  and  016  in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2018  our principal source of liquidity was 3574 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 9123 million  of marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days as of december 31 2018  all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “financial instruments” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

during the first quarter of 2018 we completed the previously disclosed repatriation of 115 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of 607 million of foreign withholding taxes which were accrued during 2017 as of december 31 2018 the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 7658 million in the first quarter of 2019 we intend to repatriate between 2450 million to 2500 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of withholding taxes based on current exchange rates 

on february 15 2018 we called for the redemption of all the outstanding subordinated convertible debentures with a redemption date of may 1 2018 substantially all of the holders elected to convert their debentures and upon conversion we settled the 125 billion principal value in cash and issued 261 million shares of common stock for the 317 billion excess of the conversion value over the principal amount the excess interest deductions on the subordinated convertible debentures that were converted were not subject to recapture and accordingly the 4392 million deferred tax liability related to the debentures was reversed into additional paidin capital upon extinguishment of the debt 

in 2018  we repurchased 44 million  shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 13786  for an aggregate cost of 6000 million  under our share repurchase program in 2017  we repurchased 63 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 9459 for an aggregate cost of 5927 million in 2016  we repurchased 78 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 8173 for an aggregate cost of 6365 million on february 7 2019 our board authorized the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of approximately 6029 million in addition to the 3971 million remaining available for repurchase under the previous share repurchase program for a total repurchase authorization of up to 10 billion under the share repurchase program 

on december 5 2018 we completed the sale of the rights economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our security services business the total purchase price subject to a cap of 1200 million consists of a payment of 500 million which was received at closing plus an additional contingent amount due after the first anniversary of closing the additional contingent amount which cannot be negative is based upon among other things the successful transition of customers to neustar during the 12month period following closing 

as of december 31 2018 we had 5500 million principal amount outstanding of 475 senior unsecured notes due 2027 5000 million principal amount outstanding of the 525 senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 7500 million principal amount outstanding of the 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2023 as of december 31 2018 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in 2020 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 

cash flows from operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

2018  compared to 2017   cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly primarily due to an increase in cash paid for income taxes partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to suppliers and employees and increases in cash received from customers and interest income the increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to the foreign withholding taxes paid on the repatriation of 115 billion cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the us in the first quarter of 2018 and us income taxes paid on accumulated foreign earnings cash paid to suppliers and employees decreased due to timing of certain vendor payments and a decrease in operating expenses cash received from customers increased primarily due to higher com  domain name registrations and renewals and the increase in net  domain name registration fees in february 2018 cash received from interest income increased due to increases in interest rates on our investments in debt securities 

2017 compared to 2016  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increases in cash received from customers and an increase in interest income partially offset by increases in cash paid to suppliers and employees cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest on our debt obligations cash received from customers increased primarily due to higher com  domain name registrations and renewals and the increase in net  domain name registration fees in february 2017 cash received from interest income increased due to increases in interest rates and our investments in debt securities cash paid to suppliers and employees increased primarily due to timing of certain vendor payments cash paid for income taxes increased due to higher nonus income tax payments cash paid for interest increased due to higher contingent interest related to the subordinated convertible debentures 

cash flows from investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment and rights to intangible assets 

  

2018  compared to 2017  we had net cash inflows from investing activities in 2018 compared to net cash outflows during 2017 primarily due to increases in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases and proceeds from the sale of businesses and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment 

  

2017 compared to 2016 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities and an increase in purchases of property and equipment partially offset by the payments made in 2016 for the future assignment of the rights to the web gtld and the proceeds received from the sale of a business 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from and repayment of borrowings and our employee stock purchase plan “espp” 

  

2018  compared to 2017  the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures during the second quarter of 2018 the proceeds received from the issuance of the 475 senior notes due 2027 in the third quarter of 2017 and an increase in share repurchases 

2017 compared to 2016 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of the 475 senior notes due 2027 in the third quarter of 2017 net of issuance costs and a decrease in share repurchases 

impact of inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented 

  

income taxes 

we expect cash paid for income taxes in 2019 to be between 950 million and 1150 million 

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2019 are anticipated to be between 450 million and 550 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k   

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2018  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

dilution from rsus 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2018  there are a total of 12 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of 10 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2018  we had 112 billion  of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business in several countries and transact in multiple foreign currencies the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the us dollar our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2018  we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 285 million  to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

    

market risk management 

  

the fair market values of our senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2018  the fair values of the senior notes issued in 2013 the senior notes issued in 2015 and the senior notes issued in 2017 were 7413 million  5022 million  and 5242 million  respectively based on available market information from public data sources

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the tv  and cc  country code toplevel domains “cctlds” for tuvalu and cocos keeling islands respectively and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs  and edu sponsored tlds these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system 

  

we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language our gtlds and cctlds can support standards compliant registrations in over 100 different native languages and scripts 

  

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years the fees charged for com  net and  name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term with respect to  com price increases require prior approval by the doc according to the terms of amendment 32 of the cooperative agreement as amended between the doc and verisign “cooperative agreement” revenues for cc  and tv  domain names and our idn gtlds are based on a similar fee system and registration system although the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann on com  net and  name  the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure and that of others for which verisign provides such services are based on the terms of verisign’s agreements with those respective registry operators  

historically we have experienced higher domain name growth in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance the effect of this seasonality has historically resulted in the largest amount of growth in our deferred revenue balance occurring during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters

as part of our operations infrastructure for our registry services business we operate all authoritative domain name servers that answer domain name queries for the com  and net  zones as well as for the other tlds for which we are the registry operator we also perform the root zone maintainer function for the core of the internet’s domain name system “dns” and administer and operate two of the 13 root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy our domain name servers provide the associated authoritative name servers and ip addresses for every com  and net  domain name on the internet and a large number of other tld queries resulting in an average of approximately 132 billion transactions per day these name servers are located in resolution facilities which are in a controlled and monitored environment incorporating security and system maintenance features this network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the internet’s dns infrastructure 

we have continuously expanded our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to address projected internet attack trends 

  

call centers and help desk we provide customer support services through our phonebased call centers email help desks and webbased selfhelp systems our virginia call center is staffed 24 hours a day every day of the year to support our businesses all call centers have a staff of trained customer support agents and also provide webbased support services utilizing customized automatic response systems to provide selfhelp recommendations

disaster recovery plans we have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities our registry services business maintains dual mirrored data centers that allow rapid failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity as well as offcontinent tertiary registry services capabilities our critical data services including domain name registration and global resolution use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as synchronous mirroring and remote replication 

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we seek to expand our business through focused marketing campaigns and programs that target growth in the com and net  domain name base both domestically and in foreign markets we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we provide tools to be used by both registrars and end users to allow them to find relevant domain names we market our security services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including direct sales and indirect channels we have marketing and sales offices in several countries around the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and security services as well as new and enhanced ways to ensure the security stability and resiliency of our services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2017  2016  and 2015  our research and development expenses were 523 million  591 million  and 637 million  respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in both the registry services and security services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 

competition in registry services    we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration establish a web presence as well as other uses of domain names such as branded email in addition to the gtlds and cctlds we operate or for which we provide backend registry services there are over 1000 other operational gtld registries over 250 latin script cctld registries more than 50 idn cctld registries and over 80 idn gtld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and other gtlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google microsoft and verizon operators of social media networks such as facebook operators of ecommerce platforms such as amazon ebay and taobao and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter in addition we may face competition from these social media businesses and ecommerce platforms if they are used to 

establish an online presence by endusers rather than through the use of a domain name furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and mobile applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among our competitors are neustar inc afilias plc and centralnic ltd 

competition in security services  several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing sales and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully in addition it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites 

our security services business faces competition from companies such as akamai technologies inc cisco neustar inc and oracle among others 

industry regulation 

  

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit the multistakeholder process has and will continue to create policies programs and standards that directly or indirectly impact or affect our business in addition countrylevel regulations such as those implemented by china impose additional costs on our registry services can affect the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations and may also affect our ability to do business similarly in the european union legislative and regulatory bodies responsible for data privacy continue to enhance and modify data privacy protections which impacts our collection and delivery of personal data as we provide our domain name registry services and could affect costs of operation 

as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com and net gtlds we have entered into certain agreements with icann and in the case of  com  the doc under a cooperative agreement 

  

com registry agreement   

following the extension of the com  registry agreement on october 20 2016 the com  registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com  gtld through november 30 2024 as part of the extension of the com  registry agreement the company and icann agreed to cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the com  registry agreement i by october 20 2018 to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the internet or the com tld and ii as may be necessary for consistency with changes to or the termination or expiration of the cooperative agreement the com  registry agreement includes pricing restrictions for com domain name registrations which sets a maximum price of 785 for a com domain name registration and is consistent with the terms of the cooperative agreement as set forth below in addition on a quarterly basis we pay 025 to icann for each annual increment of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter we are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies as well as other provisions pursuant to the com  registry agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations the com  registry agreement also provides a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve additional registry services 

the com  and net  registry agreements with icann contain a “presumptive” right of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms in addition to icann’s approval a renewal of the  com  registry agreement must be approved by the doc which under certain circumstances could refuse to grant its approval to the renewal of the com  registry agreement on similar terms or at all icann could terminate or refuse to renew our  com  andor net registry agreements if upon proper notice i we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and ii we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court see “risk factors  risks arising from our agreements governing our registry services business could limit our ability to maintain or grow our business” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information our com  and net  registry agreements contain obligations to provide access to our systems restrictions on our ability to market and bundle our products and services and restrictions on our ability to control our registrar channel or own a registrar

intellectual property 

  

we rely on a combination of copyrighted software trademarks service marks patents trade secrets knowhow restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our proprietary assets we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the us and abroad covering a wide range of our technologies additionally we continue to file numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technologies in the us patent and trademark office and internationally patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide sufficient protection of our intellectual property we continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for the verisign mark and verisign logo in the us and certain countries and have pending trademark applications for the verisign logo in a number of other countries we have common law rights in other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services 

  

our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our registry services business and certain methodologies many of which are patented or for which patent applications are pending and technical expertise and proprietary knowhow we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services we own our proprietary shared registration system through which registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day our security services business also depends on proprietary intellectual property some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors and some are based on open standards set by organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standard essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function 



we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 




 item 1a   risk factors 

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

risks arising from our agreements governing our registry services business could limit our ability to maintain or grow our business 

we are parties to i a cooperative agreement as amended with the doc with respect to the  com  gtld and ii registry agreements with icann for com  net name and other gtlds including our idn gtlds as substantially all of our revenues are derived from our registry services business limitations and obligations in or changes or challenges to these agreements particularly the agreements that involve  com  and  net  could have a material adverse impact on our business certain competing registries such as the cctlds do not face the same limitations or obligations that we face in our agreements 

modifications or amendments  in october 2016 the company and icann entered into an amendment to extend the term of the com  registry agreement to november 30 2024 the “ com  amendment” as part of the com amendment the company and icann agreed to negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the com  registry agreement i by october 20 2018 to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the internet or the com tld and ii as may be necessary for consistency with changes to or the termination or expiration of the cooperative agreement we can provide no assurance that any new terms for the com  registry agreement that we agree to as a result of the above obligations will not have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the doc approved the  com  amendment under amendment 34 to the cooperative agreement the doc did not extend the term of the cooperative agreement which will expire on november 30 2018 unless the doc in its sole discretion extends the term under amendment 34 the doc has the right to conduct a public interest review for the sole purpose of determining whether the doc will exercise its right to extend the term of the cooperative agreement in connection with the aforementioned review we agreed to cooperate fully and to work in good faith to reach a mutual agreement with the doc to resolve issues identified in such review and to work in good faith to implement any agreed upon changes as of the expiration of the current term of the cooperative agreement we can provide no assurance that any changes that we agree to as a result of the above obligations will not have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in addition our registry agreements for new gtlds including the registry agreements for our idn gtlds include icann’s right to amend the agreements without our consent which could impose unfavorable contract obligations on us that could impact our plans and competitive positions with respect to new gtlds at the time of renewal of our com  or net  registry agreements icann might also attempt to impose this same unilateral right to amend these registry agreements under certain conditions icann has also included new mandatory obligations on new gtld registry operators including us that may increase the risks and potential liabilities associated with operating new gtlds icann might seek to impose these new mandatory obligations in our other registry agreements under certain conditions we can provide no assurance that any changes to our registry agreements as a result of the above obligations will not have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

pricing  under the terms of the cooperative agreement with the doc and the com  registry agreement with icann we are restricted during the term of the registry agreement from increasing the price of registrations or renewals of  com  domain names above 785 except that we are entitled to increase the price up to 7 with the prior approval of the doc due to the imposition of any new icann consensus policies as established and defined under icann’s bylaws and due process and covering certain items listed in the  com  registry agreement or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the dns however it is uncertain that such circumstances will arise or if they do whether we would seek or the doc would approve any request to increase the price for com  domain name registrations we also have the right under the cooperative agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions however it is uncertain whether we will seek the removal of such restrictions or whether the doc would approve the removal of such restrictions in comparison under the terms of the net  and name  registry agreements with icann we are permitted to increase the price of domain name registrations and renewals in these tlds up to 10 per year additionally icann’s registry agreements for new gtlds do not contain such pricing restrictions 

vertical integration  under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership 

interest in any icannaccredited registrar historically all gtld registry operators were subject to this vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal in several instances if we were to seek removal of the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements it is uncertain whether icann andor doc approval would be obtained additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities furthermore such vertical integration restrictions do not generally apply to cctld registry operators if registry operators of other tlds or cctlds are able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration it could materially harm our business 

renewal and termination  our  com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann contain “presumptive” rights of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms on november 30 2024 june 30 2023 and august 15 2018 respectively the registry agreements for our new gtlds including our idn gtlds are subject to a 10year term and contain similar “presumptive” renewal rights if certain terms in our com  and net  registry agreements are not similar to such terms generally in effect in the registry agreements of the five largest gtlds then a renewal of these agreements shall be upon terms reasonably necessary to render such terms similar to the registry agreements for those other gtlds there can be no assurance that such terms if they apply will not have a material adverse impact on our business a renewal of the  com  registry agreement must be approved by the doc which under certain circumstances could refuse to grant its approval to the renewal of the com  registry agreement on similar terms or at all a failure i by icann or the doc to approve the renewal of the com  registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2024 or ii by icann to approve the renewal of the  net  registry agreement prior to or upon the expiration of its current term on june 30 2023 would have absent an extension a material adverse effect on our business icann could terminate or refuse to renew our  com  or  net  registry agreements if upon proper notice i we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and ii we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court icann’s termination or refusal to renew either the  com  or  net  registry agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business 

consensus policies  our registry agreements with icann require us to implement consensus policies and specifications or policies established on a temporary basis “temporary policies” icann could adopt consensus policies or temporary policies that are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of com  net and our other   gtlds that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position such consensus policies or temporary policies could have a material adverse effect on our business as an example icann has adopted a consensus policy that requires verisign to receive and display thick whois data for com  and  net  the costs of complying or failing to comply with this policy as well as laws and regulations regarding publicly identifiable information and data privacy such as domestic and various foreign privacy regimes could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming investigations or litigation 

legal challenges  our registry agreements have faced and could face in the future challenges including possible legal challenges resulting from our activities or the activities of icann registrars registrants and others and any adverse outcome from such challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and overseas may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or overseas to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation for example the government of the people’s republic of china “prc” has indicated that it will issue and in some instances has begun to issue new regulations and has begun to enforce existing regulations that impose additional costs on and risks to our provision of registry services in the prc and could impact the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations in the prc in addition to registry operators certain of such regulations will also require registrars to obtain a governmentissued license for each tld whose domain name registrations they intend to sell directly to registrants any failure to obtain the required licenses or to comply with any license requirements or any updates thereto by us or our registrars could impact the growth of our business in the prc 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling counterfeit goods and intellectual property violations such as cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have a contract 

pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and it imposes compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation which could be significant to the company 

to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and receive data originating from different jurisdictions and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches becomes effective in may 2018 other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements can impose significant costs for us that are likely to increase over time 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future in addition as we launch our idn gtlds and increase our marketing efforts of our other tlds in foreign countries we may raise our profile in certain foreign countries thereby increasing the regulatory and other scrutiny of our operations any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

undetected or unknown defects in our service security breaches defects in the technologies and services in our supply chain and ddos attacks could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data including dns data diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs any of which could harm our business performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as more broadly on internet users and consumers and thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security vulnerabilities and breaches or our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues failure to meet contracted service level obligations loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

in addition to undetected defects or errors we are also subject to cyberattacks and attempted security breaches we retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the company as an operator of critical internet infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat attacks and zerohour threats these forms of attacks involve situations where the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched in addition these forms of attacks may target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist only within the target’s supply chain or operating environment making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against in addition to external threats we may be subject to insider threats including those from thirdparty suppliers such as consultants and advisors saas providers other outside vendors or from current former or contract employees these threats can be realized from intentional or unintentional actions the shared registration system the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers and the tld zone files that we operate are critical to our registry services operations despite the significant time and money expended on our security measures we have been subject to a security breach as disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins outages resulting from destructive malcode hardware defects computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may cause an outage of or jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability fail to meet contracted service level obligations customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for operation of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

we use externally developed technology systems and services including both hardware and software for a variety of purposes including without limitation compute storage encryption and authentication backoffice support and other functions while we have developed operational policies and procedures to reduce the impact of a security breach at a vendor where company data is stored or processed such measures cannot provide absolute security breaches of our vendors’ technology systems and services could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of company data including but not limited to personal information 

additionally our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks recent attacks have demonstrated that ddos attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication and have an ability to widely disrupt internet services while we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against such attacks there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any attack even if only partially successful could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our contracted service level obligations and generally hamper our ability to provide reliable service to our registry services customers and the broader internet community further we sell ddos protection services to our security services customers although we increase our knowledge of and develop new techniques in the identification and mitigation of attacks through the protection of our security services customers the ddos protection services share some of the infrastructure used in our registry services business therefore the provision of such services might expose our critical registry services infrastructure to temporary degradations or outages caused by ddos attacks against those customers in addition to any attacks directed specifically against us and our networks 

changes to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations 

role of the us government  in the fourth quarter of 2016 the united states government completed a transition to the multistakeholder community of the historical role played by ntia in the coordination of the dns changes arising from this transition to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business for example icann has adopted bylaws that are designed in part to enhance accountability through a new organization called the empowered community which is comprised of a cross section of stakeholders icann or the empowered community may assert positions that could negatively impact our strategy or our business 

by completing the transition discussed above the us government through the ntia has ended its coordination and management of important aspects of the dns including the iana functions and the root zone there can be no assurance that the removal of the us government oversight of these key functions will not negatively impact our business 

role of icann  icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit if icann or the empowered community fails to uphold or significantly redefines the multistakeholder model it could harm our business additionally the empowered community could adversely impact icann which could negatively impact its ability to coordinate the multistakeholder system of governance or negatively affect our interests also legal regulatory or other challenges could be brought challenging the legal authority underlying the roles and actions of icann the empowered community or us 

role of foreign governments  some governments and members of the multistakeholder community have questioned icann’s role with respect to internet governance and as a result could seek a multilateral oversight body as a replacement additionally the role of icann’s governmental advisory committee which is comprised of representatives of national governments could change giving governments more control of certain aspects of internet governance some governments and governmental authorities outside the us have in the past disagreed and may in the future disagree with the actions policies or programs of icann the us government and us relating to the dns changes to the roles that foreign governments play in internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

we face risks from our operation of two root zone servers and performance of the root zone maintainer functions under the rzma 

we operate two of the 13 root zone servers root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and dns configuration data necessary to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet we also have an important operational role in support of a key iana function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative root zone data and make it available to all root server operators under an agreement with icann the root zone maintainer service agreement “rzma” 

as we perform the root zone maintainer functions under the rzma we may be subject to significant claims challenging the agreement or our performance under the agreement and we may not have immunity from or sufficient indemnification for such claims 

for example dnssec enabled in the root zone and at other levels of the dns requires new preventative maintenance including root key signing key “ksk” rollover functions and complex operational practices that did not exist prior to the introduction of dnssec any failure by us icann external dns vendors and service providers or relying parties to comply with stated practices such as those outlined in relevant dnssec practice statements introduces risk to dnssec relying parties and other internet users and consumers of the dns which could have a material adverse impact on our business in particular because root ksk rollover involves updates both to certain keys managed by us in our role as root zone maintainer and to corresponding keys maintained by external dns vendors and service providers’ dnssec implementations if such external parties are not adequately prepared for andor do not appropriately effectuate root key updates any root ksk rollover including the rollover currently planned by icann may introduce substantial risk to relying parties even where we have correctly implemented our key updates we could face potential legal claims and reputational harm if the failures described occur 

additionally over 1200 new gtlds have already been delegated into the root zone in the current round of new gtlds icann plans on offering a subsequent round of new gtlds  the timing of which remains uncertain as set forth in the verisign labs technical report 1130007 version 22 new gtld security and stability considerations released on march 28 2013 and expanded upon in subsequent publications we continue to believe there are potential security and stability issues that could involve the root zone and at other levels of the dns from the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our and others’ efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all for example domain name collisions have been reported to icann which have resulted in various network interruptions for enterprises as well as confusion and usability issues that have led to phishing attacks it is anticipated that as additional new gtlds are delegated more domain name collisions and associated security issues will occur 

the evolution of internet practices and behaviors and the adoption of substitute technologies may impact the demand for domain names 

domain names and the domain name system have been used by consumers and businesses to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity for many years the growth of technologies such as social media mobile devices apps and the dominance of search engines has evolved and changed the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses alike these changes can impact the demand for domain names by those who purchase domain names for personal commercial and investment reasons factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will monetize their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business some domain name registrars and registrants seek to purchase and resell domain names following an increase in their value adverse changes in the resale value of domain names could result in a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for domain names in our tlds obtained for resale 

some domain name registrants use a domain name to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser the use of an app on their smart phone or mobile device the use of a voice recognition technology such as alexa cortana google assistant or siri or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet users’ preferences or practices shift away from recognizing and relying on web addresses for navigation through the use of new and existing technologies iii internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content iv internet users were to significantly decrease the use of domain names to develop and protect their online identity or v internet users were to increasingly use third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names in our tlds could decrease this may trigger current or prospective customers and parties in our target markets to reevaluate their need for registration or renewal of domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo baidu and bing have and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past changed and may change in the future its search algorithm which may decrease site traffic to certain websites and provide less payperclick compensation for certain types of websites this has made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

if any of the above factors negatively impact the renewal of domain names or the demand for new domain names we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

many of our markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

we seek to serve many new developing and emerging markets in foreign countries to grow our business these markets are rapidly evolving and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely used or accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance or adoption of our services in these markets include the following 

 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer lower demand for our products reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market position we must continually improve our access to technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or launch entirely new products and services such as new gtlds in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish a web presence we have been designated as the registry operator for new gtlds including certain idn gtlds however there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be as or more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the new gtlds including our new gtlds may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and developers of desktop and mobile device software may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn gtlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well as a result of these challenges it is possible that resolution of domain names within some of these new gtlds may be blocked within certain state or organizational environments challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability on the internet 

see the “competition” section in part i item 1 for further information 

we must establish and maintain strong relationships with registrars and their resellers to maintain their focus on marketing our products and services otherwise our registry service business could be harmed 

all of our domain name registrations occur through registrars registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names as well as their own associated offerings consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars have chosen to and may continue to choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms our registrars and resellers sell domain name registrations of other competing registries including the new gtlds and some also sell and support their own services for websites such as email website hosting as well as other services therefore our registrars and resellers may be more motivated to sell to registrants to whom they can also market their own services to the extent that registrars and their resellers focus more on selling and supporting their services and less on the registration and renewal of domain names in our tlds our revenues could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully market our services to and build and maintain strong relationships with new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent if we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling registrations of domain names in our tlds as opposed to other competing tlds including the new gtlds or their own services our business could be harmed 

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to our primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for such interruptions or for potential losses arising from terrorism 

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the secure and efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the secure and efficient operation of internet service providers internet exchange point operators and internet backbone service providers some or all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control in addition if these service providers do not protect maintain improve and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the dns through their networks our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation or update of the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers or the tld zone files that we operate including for example our operation of the gov  registry or other network functions could result in a dns resolution or other service outage or degradation the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet the deletion of one or more secondlevel domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the operation or update of the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could result in similar consequences a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register or maintain domain names for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services in conformance with industry best practices the failure could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period any of these problems or outages could create potential liability including liability arising from a failure to meet our service level agreements in our registry agreements and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the reliability of our services or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet 

our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

an unfavorable global economic social and political environment has impacted or may negatively impact among other things 

 in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may have a disproportionate negative impact on our business 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic legal and political risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the us doing business in international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could materially harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 



 we rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

we also license externally developed technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions these externally developed technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our registry services business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate verisign in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold in addition in the us and most other countries word marks solely for tlds have currently not been successfully registered as trademarks accordingly we may not be able to fully realize or maintain the value of these intellectual property assets 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

we cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of other parties the international use of our logo could present additional potential risks for external party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

an external party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses including patents related to software and business methods are uncertain and evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits audits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits audits and investigations including with respect to the rzma such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in lawsuits audits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such claims lawsuits audits and investigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we explore possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the investment in and the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio our security services business backend registry services and idn gtlds in addition we have evaluated and are pursuing and will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions of tlds that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded or delegated as long as they support our growth strategy 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel possible regulatory scrutiny or thirdparty claims possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative as well as damage to our reputation if we are unsuccessful in pursuing a strategic initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net   name  and other tlds including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review or icann determines that such a review is required we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all any strategic initiative to leverage our patent portfolio will likely increase litigation risks from potential licensees and we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we operate in a unique competitive and highly regulated environment and we depend on the knowledge experience and performance of our senior management team and other key employees in this regard and otherwise we periodically experience changes in our management team if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these key individuals and additional highly skilled technical sales and marketing and other experienced employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer for example our service products are highly technical and require individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique platforms operating systems and software development tools 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis because of a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions for example we claimed a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return and recorded a net income tax benefit of 3801 million although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act significantly revamped us taxation of corporations including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 a limitation on interest deductibility and a new tax regime for foreign earnings the limitation on interest deductibility the new us taxes on accumulated and future foreign earnings other adverse changes resulting from the tax act or a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings might offset the benefit from the reduced tax rate and our future effective tax rates andor cash taxes may increase even significantly or not decrease much compared to recent or historical trends many of the provisions of the tax act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the irs or others some of the provisions of the tax act may be changed by a future congress or challenged by the world trade organization “wto” or be subject to trade or tax retaliation by other countries although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance or actions by a future congress wto or other countries they could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we might also reassess our capital structure including the amount and composition of our total indebtedness as a result of the lower tax rate and the limitation on interest deductibility which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows income tax expense on accumulated foreign earnings recorded as a result of the tax act is a provisional amount and reflects our current best estimate which may be adjusted over the course of 2018 and materially impact our results of operations 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

as of december 31 2017  we had 24 billion  in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 19 billion  was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by financial market credit and liquidity events if the global credit or liquidity market deteriorates or other events negatively impact the market for us treasury securities our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in dulles virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including 

 we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for an outside party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

as of december 31 2017  we had one billion authorized common shares of which 976 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 140 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding equity and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of our 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 “subordinated convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock in february 2018 we called for the redemption of all the outstanding subordinated convertible debentures the debentures will be redeemed on may 1 2018 and may be converted at any time before the close of business on monday april 30 2018 if holders elect to convert their debentures we intend to settle the 125 billion principal value in cash and the excess value will be settled through the issuance of shares of verisign’s stock issuance of shares to settle the subordinated convertible debentures or under our equity plans would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of outstanding debt and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness including any future indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations or to arrange alternative liquidity sources to make principal and interest payments when due or to repurchase or settle our debt if triggered by certain corporate events certain events of default or conversion it could also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry or make required capital expenditures and investments in our business make it difficult or more expensive to refinance our debt or obtain new debt trigger an event of default and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions some of our debt contains covenants which may limit our operating flexibility including restrictions on share repurchases dividends prepayment or repurchase of debt acquisitions disposing of assets if we do not continue to meet certain financial ratios any rating assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency which could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition

overview 

we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet security enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world our registry services ensure the security stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services including the com and net domains two of the internet’s root servers and the operation of the root zone maintainer function for the core of the internet’s dns our product suite also includes security services consisting of ddos protection services and managed dns services revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues on april 1 2017 we completed the sale of our idefense business 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 1464 million  com  and  net  registrations in the domain name base the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access as well as marketing activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors including overall economic conditions competition from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals 

2017  business highlights and trends 



 critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result we must evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers as discussed in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k the adoption of the new revenue guidance in accounting standards codification 606 revenue from contracts with customers  is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue recognition when it becomes effective in 2018 

  income taxes 

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of carryforwards from net operating losses “nols” capital losses domestic andor foreign tax credits the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

due to the enactment of the tax act we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for further discussion of this change see note 10 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

earnings per share 

we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our subordinated convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share under this method only a positive conversion spread related to the subordinated convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the ifconverted method which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds and from providing backend registry services to a number of tld registry operators all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with registrars or their resellers and the registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrar customers we increased the annual fee for a net domain name registration from 679 to 746 on february 1 2016 from 746 to 820 on february 1 2017 and from 820 to 902 on february 1 2018 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our agreement with icann through june 30 2023 the annual fee for a com domain name registration is 785 for the duration of the current com registry agreement through november 30 2024 except that prices may be raised by up to 7 each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability each as defined in the  com registry agreement of the dns subject to approval of the doc we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for  com and  net registrations are in us dollars revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues 

  

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares the domain name base for  com  and net  managed by our registry services business   



2017 compared to 2016 revenues increased by 229 million  primarily due to a 4 increase in the domain name base for  com and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2016 and 2017 partially offset by a 5 decline in the domain name base for  net  additionally 2016 revenue was elevated due to an increased volume of new domain name registrations primarily from our registrars in china during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 the volume of these new registrations was inconsistent and episodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016 reverted back to a more normalized registration pace a significant portion of these registrations did not renew upon expiration 

2016 compared to 2015 revenues increased by 828 million  primarily due to an increase in the average number of domain names ending in  com and  net  and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2015 and 2016 the increase in the average number of domain names ending in  com  and net  was significantly impacted by the elevated volume of registrations from our registrars in china discussed above 

growth in the domain name base has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars competitive pressure from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names and historical global economic uncertainty have limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2018 and beyond we expect revenues will continue to grow in 2018 as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2017 continued growth in the domain name base in 2018 and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2017 and 2018 

geographic revenues 

we generate revenue in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” china and certain other countries including canada australia and japan 

  the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues for our registry services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region these factors impacted revenues in china and the other region during 2017 additionally while revenues grew in the us emea and other regions during 2017 revenues from china decreased revenues from china in 2016 benefited from the increased volume of registrations in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 as discussed earlier however a significant portion of those registrations did not renew resulting in the decline in revenues from china in 2017 

  

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  



2017 compared to 2016 cost of revenues decreased by 49 million  primarily due to decreases in depreciation expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by an increase in telecommunications expenses depreciation expenses decreased by 53 million as a result of lower average hardware purchases over the last several years salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 31 million primarily due to a reduction in average headcount related to the sale of the idefense business in april 2017 partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses for the remaining employee base telecommunications expenses increased by 32 million as a result of an increase in network costs supporting our operations 

2016 compared to 2015 cost of revenues increased by 55 million  primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses and allocated overhead expenses partially offset by a decrease in telecommunications expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 60 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount and an increase in bonus expenses allocated overhead expenses increased by 15 million as a result of an increase in average headcount compared to other cost types telecommunications expenses decreased by 19 million primarily due to savings on renewals of colocation agreements 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decrease slightly in 2018 as compared to 2017 as revenue is expected to grow faster than direct costs 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



2017 compared to 2016 sales and marketing expenses increased by 17 million  primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing expenses partially offset by a decrease in salary and employee benefits expenses advertising and marketing expenses increased by 70 million primarily due to increases in costs related to certain marketing campaigns supporting our registry services business salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 42 million due to a reduction in average headcount 

2016 compared to 2015 sales and marketing expenses decreased by 99 million  primarily due to decreases in advertising and consulting expenses salary and employee benefits expenses stockbased compensation expenses and allocated overhead expenses advertising and consulting expenses decreased by 37 million primarily due to a decrease in marketing activities and advertising agency costs salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses decreased by 29 million due to a reduction in average headcount allocated overhead expenses decreased by 14 million due to the decrease in average headcount relative to other cost types 

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



2017 compared to 2016 research and development expenses decreased by 68 million  primarily due to a decrease in salary and employee benefits expenses as a result of a reduction in average headcount 

2016 compared to 2015 research and development expenses decreased by 46 million  primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses and allocated overhead costs partially offset by a decrease in capitalized labor salary and employee benefits expenses allocated overhead expenses and capitalized labor decreased by 24 million 17 million and 15 million respectively due to a reduction in average headcount 

  

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

2017 compared to 2016 general and administrative expenses increased by 118 million  primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses legal expenses and a decrease in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses increased by 49 million due to an increase in average headcount and higher projected achievement levels on certain performancebased restricted stock units “rsu” grants legal expenses increased by 45 million primarily due to higher external legal fees overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by 25 million due to an increase in the average headcount relative other cost types depreciation expenses decreased by 28 million as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures in recent years 

2016 compared to 2015 general and administrative expenses increased by 113 million  primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses stockbased compensation expenses legal expenses and a decrease in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses and certain nonincome related taxes salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 80 million due to increases in bonus expenses and average headcount stock based compensation expenses increased by 45 million due to increases in the total value of rsus granted in 2015 and 2016 and higher projected achievement levels on certain performancebased rsu grants legal expenses increased by 26 million primarily due to an increase in services performed by external legal counsel overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by 16 million due to lower average headcount for other cost types depreciation expenses decreased by 26 million as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures in recent years we incurred 21 million of certain nonincome taxes in 2015 which did not recur in 2016 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017 

interest expense 

see note 4 “debt and interest expense” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k we expect interest expense to decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a decrease in interest expense related to the subordinated convertible debentures as we notified holders that the subordinated convertible debentures will be redeemed on may 1 2018 partially offset by an increase related to the senior notes issued in july 2017 

nonoperating income loss net 

see note 9 “nonoperating income loss net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for each year presented was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by state income taxes our effective tax rate for 2017 was also impacted by the changes arising out of the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 

due to the change in tax law we will owe us federal taxes on our accumulated and future foreign earnings and as a result we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings our 2017 income tax expense includes a provisional 1624 million of expense related to the us tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a provisional 336 million deferred tax expense for foreign withholding tax on unremitted foreign earnings both net of related previously unrecognized foreign tax credits these tax expenses are offset by a tax benefit of 1868 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new us federal corporate tax rate of 21 which became effective on january 1 2018 we expect our effective tax rate to decrease slightly in 2018 as a result of the impact of the tax act for further discussion of the tax act see note 10 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2017  we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 2026 million  net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss and certain state nol carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets related to nol carryforwards increased in 2017 due to the adoption of asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting and the resulting recognition of  354 million of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation total deferred tax assets decreased in 2017 due to the usage of tax credit carryforwards to offset 2017 taxable income and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the us corporate tax rate 

we qualify for a tax holiday in switzerland which does not expire unless the required nonswiss income and expense thresholds are no longer met or there is a law change which eliminates the holiday the tax holiday provides reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also requires certain thresholds of foreign source income the tax holiday increased the company’s earnings per share by 010   016  and  014  in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2017  our principal source of liquidity was 4659 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 19 billion  of marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days as of december 31 2017  all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “fair value of financial instruments” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2017  the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 17 billion as a result of the recent changes in us tax laws we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and accordingly we recognized a provisional income tax expense of 1624 million related to the us tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and a provisional 336 million related to withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings by early second quarter of 2018 we intend to repatriate approximately 11 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of withholding taxes based on current exchange rates 

in 2017  we repurchased 63 million  shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 9459  for an aggregate cost of 5927 million under our share repurchase program in 2016  we repurchased 78 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 8173 for an aggregate cost of 6365 million in 2015  we repurchased 93 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 6659 for an aggregate cost of 6219 million on february 8 2018 our board authorized the repurchase of approximately 5858 million of our common stock in addition to the 4142 million of our common stock remaining available for repurchase under the previous share repurchase program for a total repurchase authorization of up to 10 billion of our common stock 

on july 5 2017 we issued 5500 million of 475 senior unsecured notes due july 15 2027 the proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes including but not limited to the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program as of december 31 2017 we also had 5000 million principal amount outstanding of the 525 senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 7500 million principal amount outstanding of the 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2023 

as of december 31 2017 we have a 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding this facility will expire in 2020 

as of december 31 2017  we had 125 billion principal amount outstanding of our subordinated convertible debentures the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2017 accordingly the subordinated convertible debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through march 31 2018 

we have historically derived significant tax savings from the subordinated convertible debentures as the interest deduction for tax purposes has exceeded the cash interest paid due to the structure of the debentures and the related tax laws during 2017 and 2016 the interest deduction for income tax purposes related to our subordinated convertible debentures was 1915 million and 1837 million respectively compared to cash interest paid including contingent interest of 559 million and 540 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively the size of the interest deduction for tax purposes resulted in a tax benefit that exceeded the cash interest paid for the debentures in each of these years however as a result of the enactment of the tax act which includes limits on interest deductibility and a lower us federal income tax rate these tax savings are expected to diminish in the future due to the diminished tax savings and several other factors on february 15 2018 we called for the redemption of all the outstanding subordinated convertible debentures with a redemption date of may 1 2018 if holders elect to convert their debentures we will settle the 125 billion principal amount in cash and settle the remaining value through the issuance of shares of verisign’s common stock based on the ifconverted value of the subordinated convertible debentures as of december 31 2017 the conversion spread would have required us to issue up to 254 million shares of common stock 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

2017  compared to 2016   cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increases in cash received from customers and an increase in interest income partially offset by increases in cash paid to suppliers and employees cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest on our debt obligations cash received from customers increased primarily due to higher com  domain name registrations and renewals and the increase in net  domain name registration fees in february 2017 cash received from interest income increased due to increases in interest rates and our investments in debt securities cash paid to suppliers and employees increased primarily due to timing of certain vendor payments cash paid for income taxes increased due to higher nonus income tax payments cash paid for interest increased due to higher contingent interest related to the subordinated convertible debentures 

2016 compared to 2015  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in the number of domain name registration renewals and the increase in net  domain name registration fees in february 2016 cash paid for income taxes decreased primarily due to income tax payments in 2015 related to the reorganization of certain international operations cash paid for interest increased due to the interest paid on the 5000 million senior notes issued on march 2015 and higher contingent interest related to the subordinated convertible debentures 

net cash used in investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment and rights to intangible assets 

  

2017  compared to 2016  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities and an increase in purchases of property and equipment partially offset by the payments made in 2016 for the future assignment of the rights to the web gtld and an increase in other investing activities including the proceeds received from the sale of our idefense business 

  

2016 compared to 2015 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment and other investing activities partially offset by the payments made for the future assignment of the rights to the web gtld 

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from and repayment of borrowings and our employee stock purchase plan “espp” 

  

2017  compared to 2016  the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of the 475 senior notes due 2027 in the third quarter of 2017 net of issuance costs and a decrease in share repurchases 

2016 compared to 2015 the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in march 2015 

impact of inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented 

  

income taxes 

as a result of the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 we will owe us income tax on our foreign earnings and as a result we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings we expect the amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2018 to increase due to the foreign withholding taxes that will be paid related to funds repatriated to the us and other impacts of the tax act 

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2018 are anticipated to be between 450 million and 550 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 11 “commitments and contingencies” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k   

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2017  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 11 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

dilution from rsus 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2017  there are a total of 16 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of 16 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2017  we had 22 billion  of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business in several countries and transact in multiple foreign currencies the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the us dollar our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2017  we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 297 million  to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

    

market risk management 

  

the fair market values of our subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the subordinated convertible debentures are subject to market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures the fair market value will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls as of december 31 2017  the fair value of the subordinated convertible debentures was approximately 42 billion and the fair values of the senior notes issued in 2013 the senior notes issued in 2015 and the senior notes issued in 2017 were 7729 million  5444 million  and 5637 million  respectively based on available market information from public data sources

  registry services 

  

registry services operates the authoritative directory of all com net cc tv and  name  domain names among others and the backend systems for all  gov  jobs  and edu domain names among others registry services allows individuals and organizations to establish their online identities while providing the secure alwayson access they need to communicate and transact reliably with largescale online audiences 

  

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net  and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” among others under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com  agreement the us department of commerce “doc” we are also the exclusive registry of domain names within certain transliterations of com  and net  in a number of different native languages and scripts “idn gtlds” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names in these gtlds and idn gtlds eg johndoecom and janedoenet our global constellation of domain name servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the tv  and cc  country code toplevel domains “cctlds” for tuvalu and cocos keeling islands respectively and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs  and edu gtlds among others these tlds other than gov  are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system 

  

we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language our legacy tlds and cctlds can support registrations in as many as 350 different native languages and scripts 

  

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years and the fees charged for com  net and  name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term with respect to  com price increases require prior approval by the doc according to the terms of amendment 32 of the cooperative agreement as amended between the doc and verisign “cooperative agreement” revenues for cc  and tv  domain names and our idn gtlds are based on a similar fee system and registration system though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann on com  net and  name  the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure and that of others for which verisign provides such services are based on the terms of verisign’s agreements with those respective registry operators  no fees are received from operating the edu  registry infrastructure 

historically we have experienced higher domain name growth in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance the effect of this seasonality has historically resulted in the largest amount of growth in our deferred revenue balance occurring during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters in the second half of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 we experienced an increase in the level of new domain name registrations largely through registrars in china the volume of these new registrations was inconsistent and episodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016 reverted back to a more normalized registration pace a significant portion of these domain name registrations from the second half of 2015 did not renew during the fourth quarter of 2016

we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we seek to expand our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target growth in the  com  and  net  domain name base both domestically and in emerging international markets and by extending our brand and serving new markets through the idn gtlds which we have begun launching we market our security services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including direct sales and indirect channels we have marketing and sales offices in several different countries around the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and security services as well as new and enhanced ways to ensure the security stability and resiliency of our services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2016  2015  and 2014  our research and development expenses were 591 million  637 million  and 678 million  respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in both the registry services and security services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 

competition in registry services    we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration establish a web presence as well as other uses of domain names such as branded email in addition to the gtlds and cctlds we operate or for which we provide backend registry services there are over 1140 other operational gtld registries over 250 latin script cctld registries more than 50 idn cctld registries and over 80 idn gtlds under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and other gtlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google microsoft and yahoo operators of social networks such as facebook 

and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter in addition we may face competition from these social media businesses to the extent they are used to establish an online presence by endusers instead of through the use of a domain name furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and mobile applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias plc donuts inc rightside group ltd and centralnic ltd 

competition in security services  several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully in addition it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites 

our security services business faces competition from companies such as akamai technologies inc amazon att inc bluecat networks cloudflare cisco opendns cyveillance inc dynamic network services inc fireeye inc imperva inc infoblox inc international business machines corporation level 3 communications inc neustar inc nominum inc riskiq inc secureworks threatconnect inc threatstream inc and verizon communications inc 

industry regulation 

  

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit the multistakeholder process has and will continue to create policies programs and standards that directly or indirectly impact or affect our business in addition countrylevel regulations such as those implemented by china impose additional costs on our registry services and can affect the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations similarly in the european union legislative and regulatory bodies responsible for data privacy continue to enhance and modify data privacy protections which impacts our collection and delivery of personal data as we provide our domain name registry services

in addition our registry agreements for new gtlds including the registry agreements for our idn gtlds include icann’s right to amend the agreements without our consent which could impose unfavorable contract obligations on us that could impact our plans and competitive positions with respect to new gtlds at the time of renewal of our com  or net  registry agreements icann might also attempt to impose this same unilateral right to amend these registry agreements under certain conditions icann has also included new mandatory obligations on new gtld registry operators including us that may increase the risks and potential liabilities associated with operating new gtlds icann might seek to impose these new mandatory obligations in our other registry agreements under certain conditions we can provide no assurance that any changes to our registry agreements as a result of the above obligations will not have a material adverse impact on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

pricing  under the terms of the cooperative agreement with the doc and the com  registry agreement with icann we are restricted during the term of the registry agreement from increasing the price of registrations or renewals of  com  domain names above 785 except that we are entitled to increase the price up to 7 with the prior approval of the doc due to the imposition of any new consensus policies as established and defined under icann’s bylaws or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the dns however it is uncertain that such circumstances will arise or if they do whether we would seek or the doc would approve any request to increase the price for com  domain name registrations we also have the right under the cooperative agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions if we demonstrate that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions however it is uncertain when such circumstances will arise or when they do whether the doc will agree to the removal of these pricing restrictions in comparison under the terms of the net  and name  registry agreements with icann we are permitted to increase the price of domain name registrations and renewals in these tlds up to 10 per year additionally icann’s registry agreements for the new gtlds do not contain such pricing restrictions 

vertical integration  under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership 

interest in any icannaccredited registrar historically all gtld registry operators were subject to this vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal in some instances if we were to seek removal of the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements it is uncertain whether icann andor doc approval would be obtained additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities furthermore such vertical integration restrictions do not generally apply to cctld registry operators if registry operators of new or existing gtlds or cctlds are able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration it could materially harm our business 

renewal and termination  our  com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann contain “presumptive” rights of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms on november 30 2024 july 1 2017 and august 15 2018 respectively the registry agreements for our new gtlds including our idn gtlds are subject to a 10year term and contain similar “presumptive” renewal rights if certain terms in our com  and net  registry agreements are not similar to such terms generally in effect in the registry agreements of the five largest gtlds then a renewal of these agreements shall be upon terms reasonably necessary to render such terms similar to the registry agreements for those other gtlds there can be no assurance that such terms if they apply will not have a material adverse impact on our business a renewal of the  com  registry agreement must be approved by the doc which under certain circumstances could refuse to grant its approval to the renewal of the com  registry agreement on similar terms or at all a failure i by icann or the doc to approve the renewal of the com  registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2024 or ii by icann to approve the renewal of  net  registry agreement prior to or upon the expiration of its current term on july 1 2017 would have absent an extension a material adverse effect on our business icann could terminate or refuse to renew our  com  or  net  registry agreements if upon proper notice i we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations and ii we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court icann’s termination or refusal to renew either the  com  or  net  registry agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business 

consensus policies  our registry agreements with icann require us to implement consensus policies and specifications or policies established on a temporary basis “temporary policies” icann could adopt consensus policies or temporary policies that are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of com  net and our other   gtlds that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business that subject the company to additional legal risks or that affect our competitive position such consensus policies or temporary policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legal challenges  our registry agreements have faced and could continue to face challenges including possible legal challenges resulting from our activities or the activities of icann registrars registrants and others and any adverse outcome from such challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and overseas may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or overseas to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation for example the government of the people’s republic of china “prc” has indicated that it will issue new regulations and has begun to enforce existing regulations that could impose additional costs on our provision of registry services in the prc and could impact the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations in the prc in addition to registry operators the regulations will require registrars to obtain a governmentissued license for each tld whose domain name registrations they intend to sell directly to registrants their failure to obtain the required licenses could also impact the growth of our business in the prc 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling counterfeit goods and cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have contracts pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and they impose compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation which could be significant to the company 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future in addition as we launch our idn gtlds and increase our marketing 

efforts of our other gtlds in foreign countries we may raise our profile in certain foreign countries thereby increasing the regulatory and other scrutiny of our operations any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

undetected or unknown defects in our service security breaches and ddos attacks could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data including dns data diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs any of which could harm our business performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as more broadly on internet users and consumers and thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security breaches or our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

in addition to undetected defects or errors we are also subject to cyberattacks and attempted security breaches we retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the company as an operator of critical internet infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat attacks and zerohour threats these forms of attacks involve situations where the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched in addition these forms of attacks may target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist only within the target’s operating environment making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against in addition to external threats we may be subject to insider threats from current former or contract employees these threats can be realized from intentional or unintentional actions of such employees the shared registration system the root zone servers the root zone management system the tld name servers and the tld zone files that we operate are critical to our registry services operations despite the significant time and money expended on our security measures we have been subject to a security breach as disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins outages resulting from destructive malcode computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may cause an outage of or jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for operation of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

we use externally developed technology systems and services including both hardware and software for a variety of purposes including without limitation encryption and authentication employee email backoffice support and other functions while we have developed operational policies and procedures to reduce the impact of a security breach at a vendor where company data is stored or processed such measures cannot provide absolute security breaches of our vendors’ technology systems and services could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of company data including but not limited to personal information 

additionally our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks recent attacks against others have demonstrated that ddos attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication and have an ability to widely disrupt internet services while we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against such attacks there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any attack even if only partially successful could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our contracted service level obligations and generally hamper our ability to provide reliable service to our registry services customers and the broader internet community further we sell ddos protection services to our security services customers although we increase our knowledge of and develop new techniques in the identification and mitigation of attacks through the protection of our security services customers the ddos protection services share some of the infrastructure used in our registry services business therefore the provision of such services might expose our critical 

registry services infrastructure to temporary degradations or outages caused by ddos attacks against those customers in addition to any directed specifically against us and our networks 

changes to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations 

role of the us government  in the fourth quarter of 2016 the united states government completed a transition of the historical role played by ntia in the coordination of the dns changes arising from this transition to the multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business for example icann has adopted bylaws that are designed in part to enhance accountability through a new organization called the empowered community which is comprised of a cross section of industry participants icann or the empowered community may assert positions that could negatively impact our strategy or our business 

furthermore as part of the transition the ntia discharged us from our obligations under the cooperative agreement to perform root zone maintainer functions and we entered into a new agreement with icann the root zone maintainer service agreement “rzma” under which we now perform the root zone maintainer functions on behalf of icann as we perform the root zone maintainer function under the rzma we may be subject to claims challenging the agreement or our performance under the agreement and we may not have immunity from or sufficient indemnification for such claims 

by completing the transition discussed above the us government through the ntia has ended its coordination and management of important aspects of the dns including the iana functions and the root zone there can be no assurance that the removal of the us government oversight of these key functions will not negatively impact our business 

role of icann  icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit if icann or the empowered community fails to uphold or significantly redefines the multistakeholder model it could harm our business additionally the empowered community could adversely impact icann which could negatively impact its ability to coordinate the multistakeholder system of governance or negatively affect our interests also legal regulatory or other challenges could be brought challenging the legal authority underlying the roles and actions of icann the empowered community or us 

role of foreign governments  some governments and members of the multistakeholder community have questioned icann’s role with respect to internet governance and as a result could seek a multilateral oversight body as a replacement additionally the role of icann’s governmental advisory committee which is comprised of representatives of national governments could change giving governments more control of internet governance some governments and governmental authorities outside the us have in the past disagreed and may in the future disagree with the actions policies or programs of icann the us government and us relating to the dns changes to the roles that foreign governments play in internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

we operate two root zone servers and are contracted to perform the root zone maintainer function under icann’s new gtld program we face increased risk from these operations 

we operate two of the 13 root zone servers root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and dns configuration data necessary to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet under the rzma we play a key operational role in support of the iana function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative root zone data and make it available to all root server operators 

under its new gtld program icann has recommended delegations into the root zone of a large number of new gtlds in view of our role as the root zone maintainer and as a root server operator we face increased risks should icann’s delegation of these new gtlds which represent unprecedented changes to the root zone in volume and frequency cause security and stability problems within the dns andor for parties who rely on the dns such risks include potential instability of the dns including potential fragmentation of the dns should icann’s delegations create sufficient instability and potential claims based on our role in the root zone provisioning and delegation process these risks alone or in the aggregate have the potential to cause serious harm to our registry services business further our business could also be harmed through security stability and resiliency degradation if the delegation of new gtlds into the root zone causes problems to certain components of the dns ecosystem or other aspects of the global dns or other relying parties are negatively impacted as a result of domain name collisions or other new gtld security issues such as exposure or other leakage of private or sensitive information 

additionally dnssec enabled in the root zone and at other levels of the dns requires new preventative maintenance functions and complex operational practices that did not exist prior to the introduction of dnssec any failure by us or the iana functions operator to comply with stated practices such as those outlined in relevant dnssec practice statements introduces risk to dnssec relying parties and other internet users and consumers of the dns which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the evolution of internet practices and behaviors and the adoption of substitute technologies may impact the demand for domain names 

domain names and the domain name system have been used by consumers and businesses to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity for many years the growth of technologies such as social media mobile devices apps and the dominance of search engines has evolved and changed the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses alike these changes can impact the demand for domain names by those who purchase domain names for personal commercial and investment reasons factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will monetize their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business some domain name registrars and registrants seek to purchase and resell domain names following an increase in their value adverse changes in the resale value of domain names could result in a decrease in the demand andor renewal rates for domain names in our tlds obtained for resale 

some domain name registrants use a domain name to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser the use of an app on their smart phone or mobile device the use of a voice recognition technology such as alexa cortana google assistant or siri or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet users’ preferences or practices shift away from recognizing and relying on web addresses for navigation through the use of new and existing technologies iii internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content or iv internet users were to increasingly use third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names in our tlds could decrease this may trigger current or prospective customers and parties in our target markets to reevaluate their need for registration or renewal of domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo baidu and bing have and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past changed and may change in the future its search algorithm which may decrease site traffic to certain websites and provide less payperclick compensation for certain types of websites this has made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

if any of the above factors negatively impact the renewal of domain names or the demand for new domain names we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

many of our markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

we seek to serve many new developing and emerging markets in foreign countries to grow our business these markets are rapidly evolving and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely used or accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance or adoption of our services in these markets include the following 



 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

we may face operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann and our provision of backend registry services 

approximately 1000 new gtlds have already been delegated in this initial round of new gtlds icann plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain as set forth in the verisign labs technical report 1130007 version 22 new gtld security and stability considerations released on march 28 2013 and expanded upon in our more recent publications we continue to believe there are issues regarding the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our and others’ efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all for example domain name collisions have been reported to icann which have resulted in various network interruptions for enterprises as well as confusion and usability issues that have led to phishing attacks it is anticipated that as additional new gtlds are delegated more domain name collisions and associated security issues will occur 

we have entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other registry operators and applicants for new gtlds we may face risks regarding icann requirements for mitigating name collisions in the new gtlds which we operate or for which we provide backend registry services for example the possibility exists that “controlled interruption” periods may disrupt network services or that privacy or secure communications may be impacted as a result of insufficient preparedness by icann and the community for the launch of new gtlds 

our agreements with icann to provide registry services in connection with our new gtlds including our idn gtlds and our agreements to provide backend registry services directly to other applicants and indirectly through reseller relationships expose us to operational and other risks for example the increase in the number of gtlds for which we provide registry services on a standalone basis or as a backend service provider could further increase costs or increase the frequency or scope of targeted attacks from nefarious actors 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer lower demand for our products price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market position we must continually improve our access to technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or launch entirely new products and services such as new gtlds in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish a web presence we have applied for new gtlds including certain idn gtlds however there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be as or more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the new gtlds including our new gtlds may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn gtlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well as a result of these challenges it is possible that resolution of domain names within some of these new gtlds may be blocked within certain 

state or organizational environments challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability on the internet 

see the “competition” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we must establish and maintain strong relationships with registrars and their resellers to maintain their focus on marketing our products and services otherwise our registry service business could be harmed 

all of our domain name registrations occur through registrars registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars have chosen to and may continue to choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms our registrars and resellers sell domain name registrations of other competing registries and some also sell and support their own services for websites such as email website hosting as well as other services therefore our registrars and resellers may be more motivated to sell to registrants to whom they can also market their own services to the extent that registrars and their resellers focus more on selling and supporting their services and less on the registration and renewal of our tlds our revenues could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully market our services to and build and maintain strong relationships with new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent if we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling our tlds as opposed to other competing tlds or their own services our business could be harmed 

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to our primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for such interruptions or for potential losses arising from terrorism 

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers some or all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control in addition if these service providers do not protect maintain improve and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the dns through their networks our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation or update of the root zone servers the root zone file the root zone management system the tld name servers or the tld zone files that we operate or other network functions could result in a dns resolution or other service outage or degradation the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet the deletion of one or more secondlevel domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the 

operation or update of the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could result in similar consequences a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register or maintain domain names for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services in conformance with industry best practices the failure could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period any of these problems or outages could create potential liability including liability arising from a failure to meet our service level agreements in our registry agreements and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

an unstable global economic social and political environment including hostilities and conflicts in various regions both inside and outside the us natural disasters currency fluctuations and country specific operating regulations may have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations the economic social and political environment has impacted or may negatively impact among other things 

 in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may have a disproportionate negative impact on our business 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic legal and political risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the us doing business in international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could materially harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 



 we rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

we also license externally developed technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions these externally developed technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our registry services business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold in addition in the us and most other countries’ word marks for tlds have currently not been successfully registered as trademarks accordingly we may not be able to fully realize or maintain the value of these intellectual property assets 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

we cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of other parties the international use of our logo could present additional potential risks for external party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

an external party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for 

which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses including patents related to software and business methods are uncertain and evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits and investigations including with respect to the rzma such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in lawsuits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such investigations claims and lawsuits could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we explore possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the investment in and the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio our security services business backend registry services and idn gtlds in addition we have evaluated and are pursuing and will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions of tlds that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded as long as they support our growth strategy 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel possible regulatory scrutiny or thirdparty claims possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative as well as damage to our reputation if we are unsuccessful in pursuing a strategic initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net   name  and other tlds including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review or icann determines that such a review is required we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all any strategic initiative to leverage our patent portfolio will likely increase litigation risks from potential licensees and we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we operate in a unique competitive and highly regulated environment and we depend on the knowledge experience and performance of our senior management team and other key employees in this regard and otherwise we periodically experience changes in our management team if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these key individuals and additional highly skilled technical sales and marketing and other experienced employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer for example our service products are highly technical and require individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique platforms and software implementation 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax 

positions for example we claimed a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return and recorded a net income tax benefit of 3801 million although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned in low tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates 

various legislative changes that would reform us corporate tax laws have been or may be proposed by the trump administration as well as members of congress including proposals that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we are unable to predict whether these or other proposals will be implemented although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense or cash flow 

our foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested offshore constitute a majority of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and there is a high cost associated with a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion or a repatriation of those funds to the us 

a majority of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore and are not available to be used in the us for working capital needs debt obligations acquisitions share repurchases dividends or other general corporate purposes in the event that funds from our foreign operations are needed in the us for any purpose we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate those funds which could be significant further if we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings our effective tax rate would increase these could adversely impact our business valuation and stock price 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

as of december 31 2016  we had 18 billion  in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 16 billion  was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by financial market credit and liquidity events if the global credit or liquidity market deteriorates or other events negatively impact the market for us treasury securities our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in dulles virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including 

 we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for an outside party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

as of december 31 2016  we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1031 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 126 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding equity and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of our 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 “subordinated convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of outstanding debt and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness including any future indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations or to arrange alternative liquidity sources to make principal and interest payments when due or to repurchase or settle our debt if triggered by certain corporate events certain events of default or conversion it could also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry or make required capital expenditures and investments in our business make it difficult or more expensive to refinance our debt or obtain new debt trigger an event of default and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions some of our debt contains covenants which may limit our operating flexibility including restrictions on share repurchases dividends prepayment or repurchase of debt acquisitions disposing of assets if we do not continue to meet certain financial ratios any rating assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency which could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future the settlement amount contingent interest and potential recapture of income tax deductions related to our subordinated convertible debentures can be substantial and can increase significantly based on changes in our stock price the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition

overview 

we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet security enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world our registry services ensure the security stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services including the com and net domains two of the internet’s root servers and the operation of the root zone maintainer function for the core of the internet’s dns our product suite also includes security services consisting of ddos protection services idefense services and managed dns services revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues on february 9 2017 we entered into an agreement to sell the idefense business subject to customary closing conditions 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 1422 million  com  and  net  registrations in the domain name base the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access as well as marketing activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors including overall economic conditions competition from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals 

2016  business highlights and trends 



 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result we must evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our subordinated convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on stock price bond price risk free interest rates volatility and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

earnings per share 

we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our subordinated convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share under this method only a positive conversion spread related to the subordinated convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the ifconverted method which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds and from providing backend registry services to a number of tld registry operators all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with registrars or their resellers and the registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars we increased the annual fee for a net domain name registration from 618 to 679 on february 1 2015 from 679 to 746 on february 1 2016 and from 746 to 820 on february 1 2017 the annual fee for a com domain name registration is fixed at 785 for the duration of the current com registry agreement through november 30 2024 except that prices may be raised by up to 7 each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability each as defined in the  com registry agreement of the dns subject to approval of the doc we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for  com and  net registrations are in us dollars revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues 

  

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares the domain name base for  com  and net  managed by our registry services business   



2016 compared to 2015 revenues increased by 828 million  primarily due to an increase in the average number of domain names ending in  com and  net  and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2015 and 2016 growth in the domain name base was primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations primarily from our registrars in china the volume of these new registrations was inconsistent and episodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016 reverted back to a more normalized registration pace a significant portion of these registrations from the second half of 2015 did not renew in the fourth quarter of 2016 which resulted in a net decrease of 19 million domain name registrations during the quarter despite the decrease in the domain name base in the fourth quarter 2016 revenues benefited from this increased volume of registrations in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 

2015 compared to 2014 revenues increased by 492 million primarily due to a 6 increase in the number of domain names ending in  com and  net  and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2014 and 2015 total revenue growth of 5 was slightly less than the 6 growth in the domain name base due to the timing of registrations throughout the year as a significant portion of new registrations occurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 

  ongoing economic uncertainty competitive pressure from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2017 and beyond 

we expect revenues will remain consistent in 2017 as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2016 continued growth in the domain name base in 2017 and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2016 and 2017 partially offset by the decrease in revenue resulting from the planned divestiture of our idefense business 

geographic revenues 

we generate revenue in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” china and certain other countries including canada australia and japan 

  the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues for our registry services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region although revenues continued to grow in the more mature markets of the us and emea during 2016 china saw the highest growth rate due in part to the increased volume of new registrations during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 

  

cost of revenues

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

2016 compared to 2015 general and administrative expenses increased by 113 million  primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses stockbased compensation expenses legal expenses and a decrease in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses and certain nonincome related taxes salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 80 million due to increases in bonus expenses and average headcount stock based compensation expenses increased by 45 million due to increases in the total value of restricted stock units “rsus” granted in 2015 and 2016 and higher projected achievement levels on certain performancebased rsu grants legal expenses increased by 26 million primarily due to an increase in services performed by external legal counsel overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by 16 million due to lower average headcount for other cost types depreciation expenses decreased by 26 million as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures in recent years we incurred 21 million of certain nonincome taxes in 2015 which did not recur in 2016 

2015 compared to 2014 general and administrative expenses increased by 92 million primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses legal expenses and miscellaneous expenses partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation increased by 43 million due to annual salary increases and increased expenses related to employee benefits stock based compensation expense increased due to an increase in expense related to performancebased rsus and the impact of new rsu grants which had a higher grant date fair value due to the increase in our stock price partially offset by additional expense recognized in 2014 for certain performancebased rsus which were recorded based on their periodend fair value legal expenses increased by 33 million primarily due to an increase in services performed by external legal counsel miscellaneous expenses increased by 40 million primarily due to expenses for certain nonincome related taxes in 2015 and certain expense reversals in 2014 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 26 million due to a decrease in consulting costs supporting various corporate functions 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016 

interest expense 

see note 6 “debt and interest expense” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k we expect interest expense to remain consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016 

nonoperating income loss net 

see note 11 “nonoperating income loss net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for each year presented was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by state income taxes our effective tax rate for 2014 was also impacted by net income tax expense of 98 million related to a reorganization of certain international operations and changes in estimates related to the 2013 worthless stock deduction and the 2014 repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2016  we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 2357 million  net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss “nol” carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards decreased in 2016 as a portion of the nol and tax credit carryforwards were utilized to offset 2016 taxable income 

beginning in 2015 we qualified for a tax holiday in switzerland which does not expire unless the required thresholds are no longer met or there is a law change which eliminates the holiday we qualified for another tax holiday in switzerland which expired on december 31 2016 but may be renewed if certain criteria are satisfied an additional tax holiday in switzerland expired in 2014 and was not extended the tax holidays provide reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of foreign source income these tax holidays increased the company’s earnings per share by 016  014  and  050  in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2016  our principal source of liquidity was 2319 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 16 billion  of marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days as of december 31 2016  all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “cash cash equivalents and marketable securities” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2016  the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 14 billion our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and accordingly we have not provided deferred us taxes for these funds in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the us and if us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds as of december 31 2016  the amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred income taxes have not been provided was 9267 million  

in 2016  we repurchased 78 million  shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 8173  for an aggregate cost of 6365 million under our share repurchase program in 2015  we repurchased 93 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 6659 for an aggregate cost of 6219 million in 2014  we repurchased 163 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 5315 for an aggregate cost of 8671million on february 9 2017 our board authorized the repurchase of approximately 6409 million of our common stock in addition to the 3591 million of our common stock remaining available for repurchase under the previous share repurchase program for a total repurchase authorization of up to 10 billion of our common stock 

on march 27 2015 we issued 5000 million of 525 senior unsecured notes due april 1 2025 the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including but not limited to the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program as of december 31 2016 we also had 7500 million of 4625 senior unsecured notes outstanding which are due in may 2023 

on march 31 2015 we entered into a new 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility this facility will expire in 2020 and replaced our prior unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 

as of december 31 2016  we had 125 billion principal amount outstanding of our subordinated convertible debentures the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2016 accordingly the subordinated convertible debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through march 31 2017 we do not expect a material amount of the subordinated convertible debentures to be converted in the near term as the trading price of the debentures exceeds the value that is likely to be received upon conversion however we cannot provide any assurance that the trading price of the debentures will continue to exceed the value that would be derived upon conversion or that the holders will not elect to convert the subordinated convertible debentures if a holder elects to convert its subordinated convertible debentures we are permitted under the indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the conversion value as defined in the indenture in cash stock or a combination thereof if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of conversion we currently have the intent and the ability based on current facts and circumstances to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash however if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures that holders actually elect to convert exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert the subordinated convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding and they are an important part of our capital structure although we 

will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indenture starting in august 2017 our intention based on current conditions is to not redeem these debentures which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue 

we paid contingent interest of 134 million in 2016 and 108 million in 2015 in addition to the normal coupon interest on the subordinated convertible debentures on february 16 2017 we paid contingent interest of 77 million and we will pay an additional 75 million in august 2017 

during the third quarter of 2016 we paid 1430 million for the future assignment to us of contractual rights to the web  gtld pending resolution of objections by other applicants regulatory review and approval from icann 

during 2014 we repatriated approximately 7409 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes of 281 million we utilized substantially all of the remaining net operating losses generated from the 2013 worthless stock deduction to offset 2014 taxable income including the taxable income recognized in the us as a result of the repatriation 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

2016  compared to 2015   cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in the number of domain name registration renewals and the increase in net  domain name registration fees in february 2016 cash paid for income taxes decreased primarily due to income tax payments in 2015 related to the reorganization of certain international operations cash paid for interest increased due to the interest paid on the 5000 million senior notes issued on march 2015 and higher contingent interest related to the subordinated convertible debentures 

2015 compared to 2014  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations cash paid for interest increased as a result of the contingent interest paid to holders of the subordinated convertible debentures and the additional interest paid on the 5000 million senior notes issued in march 2015 

net cash used in provided by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment and rights to intangible assets 

  

2016  compared to 2015  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment and other investing activities partially offset by the payments made for the future assignment of the rights to the web gtld 

  

2015 compared to 2014 the change in cash used in provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities partially offset by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from and repayment of borrowings stock option exercises our employee stock purchase plan “espp” and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

  

2016  compared to 2015  the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in march 2015 partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in 2015 a decrease in share repurchases and higher recognized excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation partially offset by lower proceeds from stock option exercises and espp 

impact of inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented 

  

income taxes 

we derive significant tax savings from the subordinated convertible debentures during 2016 and 2015 the interest deduction for income tax purposes related to our subordinated convertible debentures was 1837 million and 1750 million respectively compared to cash interest paid including contingent interest of 540 million and 514 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively for income tax purposes we deduct interest expense on the subordinated convertible debentures calculated at 85 of the adjusted issue price subject to adjustment for actual versus projected contingent interest the adjusted issue price and consequently the interest deduction for income tax purposes grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken using a comparable yield of 85 on the adjusted issue price and the coupon rate of 325 on the principal amount compounded annually the interest deduction taken is subject to recapture upon settlement to the extent that the amount paid in cash or stock to settle subordinated convertible debentures is less than the adjusted issue price interest recognized in accordance with gaap which is calculated at 839 of the liability component of the subordinated convertible debentures will also grow over the term but at a slower rate this difference will result in a continuing increase in the deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

we do not expect to pay significant us federal income taxes during 2017 as a result of the interest deduction on our subordinated convertible debentures the use of foreign tax credits and other tax attributes we expect the amount of cash paid for nonus income taxes in 2017 to increase compared to 2016 

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2017 are anticipated to be between 350 million and 450 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k   

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2016  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

dilution from subordinated convertible debentures rsus and stock options 

any conversion of our subordinated convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the subordinated convertible debentures we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount “the conversion spread” may be settled in shares of common stock as of december 31 2016  there are 364 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the subordinated convertible debentures based on the ifconverted value of the subordinated convertible debentures as of december 31 2016  the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to 199 million shares of common stock 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2016  there are a total of 18 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of 18 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2016  we had 16 billion  of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business in several countries and transact in multiple foreign currencies the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the us dollar our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2016  we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 392 million  to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

    

market risk management 

  

the fair market values of our subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the subordinated convertible debentures are subject to market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures the fair market value will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes as of december 31 2016  the fair value of the subordinated convertible debentures was approximately 28 billion and the fair values of the senior notes issued in 2013 and the senior notes issued in 2015 were 7641 million  and 5141 million  respectively based on available market information from public data sources 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on subordinated convertible debentures is also subject to market risk and to a lesser extent to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will increase or decrease with the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures

  registry services

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net  and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com  agreement the us department of commerce “doc” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names in these gtlds eg johndoecom and janedoenet our global constellation of domain name servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the tv  and cc  country code toplevel domains “cctlds” for tuvalu and cocos keeling islands respectively and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs  and edu gtlds among others these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system 

  

with our existing gtlds and cctlds we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language currently idns may be registered in as many as 350 different native languages and scripts 

  

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years and the fees charged for com  net and  name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term with respect to  com price increases require prior approval by the doc according to the terms of amendment 32 of the cooperative agreement as amended between the doc and verisign “cooperative agreement” revenues for cc  and tv  domain names are based on a similar fee system and registration system though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the registry operator of jobs no fees are received from operating the edu  registry infrastructure 

historically we have experienced higher domain name growth in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance the effect of this seasonality has historically resulted in the largest amount of growth in our deferred revenue balance occurring during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters in the second half of 2015 we experienced an increase in the level of new domain name registrations in our australia china india and other asia pacific countries “apac” region which were coming largely through registrars in china

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we seek to expand our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target growth in the  com  and  net  domain name base particularly in emerging international markets and by extending our brand and serving new markets through the idn gtlds which we have begun launching we market our security services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including direct sales and indirect channels we have marketing and sales offices throughout the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and security services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2015  2014  and 2013  our research and development expenses were 637 million  678 million  and 703 million  respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline in conjunction we also continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in each of the registry services and security services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 

competition in registry services   we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish a web presence in addition to the three gtlds we operate  com   net  and  name  other gtlds and cctlds for which we provide backend registry services and the idn gtlds that we began to launch in late 2015 there are over 840 other operational gtld registries over 250 latin script cctld registries and more than 40 idn cctld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and other gtlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias plc 

donuts inc rightside group ltd and centralnic ltd in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google microsoft and yahoo operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter in addition we may face competition from these social media businesses to the extent they are used to establish an online presence by end users instead of through the use of a domain name furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

competition in security services several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully in addition it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites 

our security services business faces competition from companies such as international business machines corporation secunia aps dell secureworks mcafee inc akamai technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dynamic network services inc neustar inc bluecat networks infoblox inc nominum inc fireeye inc cyveillance inc threatconnect inc threatstream inc riskiq inc level 3 communications inc and imperva inc 

industry regulation 

  

registry services within the us government oversight of the dns is provided by the doc effective october 1 2009 the doc and icann entered into a new agreement known as the affirmation of commitments “aoc” which replaced the seventh amendment of the original memorandum of understanding and known as the joint project agreement under the aoc the doc became one of several parties working together with other representative constituency members in providing an ongoing review of icann’s performance and accountability the aoc sets forth a periodic review process by committees which provide for more international and multidiscipline participation these review panels are charged with reviewing and making recommendations regarding i the accountability and transparency of icann ii the security stability and resiliency of the dns iii the impact of new gtlds on competition consumer trust and consumer choice and iv the effectiveness of icann’s policies with respect to registrant data in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust under the aoc the assistant secretary of communications and information of the doc will be a member of the “accountability and transparency” review panel individual reviews from each panel generally are to occur no less than every three to four years 

  

as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com  net and name gtlds we have entered into certain agreements with icann and in the case of  com  the doc 

  

com  registry agreement on november 29 2012 we renewed our registry agreement with icann for the com gtld the “ com  registry agreement” the com  registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com  gtld through november 30 2018 the com  registry agreement includes pricing restrictions for com domain name registrations consistent with the terms of the cooperative agreement as set forth below additionally on a quarterly basis we pay 025 to icann for each annual increment of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k we are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies as well as other provisions pursuant to the com  registry agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations the com  registry agreement also provides a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve additional registry services 

the com  registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed for successive terms unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the com  registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach as further described below verisign may not enter into any renewal of the com  registry agreement or any other extension or continuation of or substitution for the  com  registry agreement without prior written approval by the doc 

icann and verisign submitted a proposal to the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” describing how best to remove ntia’s administrative role associated with the root zone management in a manner that maintains the security stability and resiliency of the internet’s domain name system icann and verisign are in the final stages of drafting the new root zone maintainer agreement to perform this root zone maintainer role as a commercial service for icann upon the successful transition of the internet assigned numbers authority “iana” functions to ensure that root operations continue to perform at the same high level during the expected 10year term of the root zone maintainer agreement icann and verisign are in discussions to extend the term of the com  registry agreement to coincide with the expected 10year term of the root zone 

maintainer agreement while icann and verisign are in the final stages of preparing the root zone maintainer agreement and the  com  registry agreement extension documents there are several important steps that need to occur including completing the drafting of the agreements posting them for public comment and obtaining approvals from icann’s and verisign’s boards of directors additionally under the cooperative agreement we may not enter into the contemplated extension of the  com  registry agreement without the prior written approval of the doc if the doc does not approve the extension then the current  com  registry agreement will remain unchanged there can be no assurance that either the root zone maintainer agreement or the changes to the  com  registry agreement will be approved or if approved will be in the form described 

  

cooperative agreement on november 29 2012 verisign and the doc entered into amendment number thirtytwo 32 “amendment 32” to the cooperative agreement between verisign and the doc the “cooperative agreement” which approved the renewal of the  com  registry agreement on the terms and conditions described below as in the public interest except as modified by amendment 32 the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement including amendment thirty 30 to the cooperative agreement which was entered into on november 29 2006 by the company and the doc remain unchanged amendment 32 provides that the maximum price as defined in the com  registry agreement of a com  domain name shall not exceed 785 for the term of the com  registry agreement except that the we are entitled to increase the maximum price of a com  domain name due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security or stability of the dns as described in the com  registry agreement provided that we may not exercise such right unless the doc provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest such approval not to be unreasonably withheld amendment 32 further provides that we shall be entitled at any time during the term of the  com  registry agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the com  registry agreement if we demonstrate to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the com  registry agreement as determined by the doc amendment 32 also provides that the doc’s approval of the com  registry agreement is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on us with respect to the com  registry agreement and extends the term of the cooperative agreement through november 30 2018 the cooperative agreement also provides that any renewal or extension of the com  registry agreement is subject to prior written approval by the doc amendment 30 to the cooperative agreement provides that the doc shall approve such renewal if it concludes that approval will serve the public interest in a the continued security and stability of the internet dns and the operation of the com  registry including in addition to other relevant factors consideration of verisign’s compliance with consensus policies and technical specifications its service level agreements as set forth in the com  registry agreement and the investment associated with improving the security and stability of the dns and b the provision of registry services as defined in the com  registry agreement at reasonable prices terms and conditions the parties have an expectancy of renewal of the com  registry agreement so long as the foregoing public interest standard is met and verisign is not in breach of the com  registry agreement 

  

net  registry agreement on june 27 2011 we entered into a renewal of our registry agreement with icann for the net gtld the “ net  registry agreement” the net  registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the net  tld through june 30 2017 the net  registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the net  registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach

intellectual property 

  

we rely on a combination of copyrighted software trademarks service marks patents trade secrets knowhow restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our proprietary assets we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the us and abroad covering a wide range of our technologies additionally we continue to file numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technologies in the us patent and trademark office and internationally patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection we continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for the verisign mark and verisign logo in the us and certain countries and have pending trademark applications for the verisign logo in a number of other countries we have common law rights in other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services 

  

our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our registry services businesses and certain methodologies many of which are patented or for which patent applications are pending and technical expertise and proprietary knowhow we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses we own our proprietary shared registration system through which registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on open standards set by organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standard essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

  

as a result of the sale of our authentication services business symantec obtained the rights to the domain name and operation of the website wwwverisigncom for a period of five years the five year term expired in august 2015 at which time the domain name and operation of the website wwwverisigncom reverted back to us 

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function 



we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

risks arising from our agreements governing our registry services business could limit our ability to maintain or grow our business 

we are parties to i a cooperative agreement as amended with the doc with respect to the  com  gtld and certain other aspects of the dns and ii registry agreements with icann for com  net name and other gtlds including our idn gtlds as substantially all of our revenues are derived from our registry services business limitations in these agreements could have a material impact on our business 

pricing  under the terms of the cooperative agreement with the doc and the com  registry agreement with icann we are generally restricted from increasing the price of registrations or renewals of  com  domain names except that we are entitled to increase the price up to seven percent with the prior approval of the doc due to the imposition of any new consensus policies or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the dns however it is uncertain that such circumstances will arise or if they do that the doc will approve our request to increase the price for com  domain name registrations we also have the right under the cooperative agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions if we demonstrate that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions however it is uncertain that such circumstances will arise or if they do that the doc will agree to the removal of these pricing restrictions in connection with a renewal of the  com  registry agreement we can seek an increase of the price for  com  domain name registrations regardless of whether we seek such an increase there can be no assurance of the price that doc will approve in connection with a renewal of the  com  registry agreement under the terms of the net  and name  registry agreements with icann we are permitted to increase the price of registrations and renewals in these tlds up to ten percent per year additionally icann’s registry agreements for other new gtlds do not contain such pricing restrictions 

vertical integration  under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar historically all gtld registry operators were subject to this vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal in some instances if we were to seek removal of the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements it is uncertain whether icann andor doc approval would be obtained additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities furthermore unless prohibited by icann as noted above such vertical integration restrictions do not generally apply to cctld registry operators if registry operators of new or existing gtlds or cctlds are able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration it could materially harm our business 

termination or nonrenewal  under the cooperative agreement as amended the doc must approve any renewal or extension of the com  registry agreement the doc under certain circumstances could refuse to grant its approval to the renewal of the com  registry agreement on similar terms or at all any failure of the doc to approve the renewal of the com  registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2018 would have a material adverse effect on our business under certain circumstances icann could terminate or refuse to renew one or more of our registry agreements including for com net  and our other gtlds see the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on these circumstances 

modification or amendment  our registry agreements for new gtlds including the registry agreements for our idn gtlds include icann’s right to amend the agreement without our consent which could impose unfavorable contract obligations on us that could impact our plans and competitive positions with respect to new gtlds at the time of renewal of our com  or net  registry agreements icann might also attempt to impose this same unilateral right to amend these registry agreements under certain conditions icann has also included new mandatory obligations on new gtld registry operators including us that may increase the risks and potential liabilities associated with operating new gtlds icann might seek to impose these new mandatory obligations in our other registry agreements under certain conditions 

legal challenges  our registry agreements have faced and could continue to face challenges including possible legal challenges resulting from our activities or the activities of icann registrars registrants and others and any adverse outcome from such challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business 

consensus policies  our registry agreements with icann require us to implement consensus policies icann could adopt consensus policies that are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of com  net and our other   gtlds that are inconsistent with our current or future plans that impose substantial costs on our business or that affect our competitive position such consensus policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and overseas may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or overseas to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation for example the government of the people’s republic of china “prc” has indicated that it will issue new regulations and begin to enforce existing regulations that will require registry operators to among other things obtain a governmentissued license in order to provide registry services to registrars located in the prc the new regulations could impose additional costs on our provision of registry services in the prc and could impact the growth or renewal rates of domain name registrations in the prc while we have submitted applications to the government of the prc to obtain the licenses required by the regulations there can be no assurance that we will obtain the licenses or obtain the licenses in a timely manner our failure to obtain the licenses could result in restrictions up to and including a prohibition on the sale of our registry services to registrars located in the prc in addition to registry operators the regulations will require registrars to obtain a governmentissued license for each tld whose domain names they intend to sell directly to registrants their failure to obtain the required licenses could also impact the growth of our business in the prc 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling to the extent we provide services to this sector counterfeit goods and cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have contracts pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and they impose compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation which could be significant to the company 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future in addition as we began to launch our idn gtlds in late 2015 we may raise our profile in certain foreign countries thereby increasing the regulatory and other scrutiny of our operations any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

undetected or unknown defects in our service security breaches and largescale ddos attacks could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as more broadly on internet users and consumers and thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business our failure to identify remediate and mitigate security breaches or our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

in addition to undetected defects or errors we are also subject to cyberattacks and attempted security breaches we retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the company as an operator of critical internet infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat “apt” attacks and zerohour threats which means that the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched and may well target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist only within the target’s operating environment making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against the 

shared registration system the root zone servers the root zone files tld name servers and tld zone files that we operate are critical hardware and software to our registry services operations despite the significant time and money expended on our security measures we have been subject to a security breach as disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins outages resulting from destructive malcode computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may cause an outage of or jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for certain of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

additionally our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks while we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against such attacks there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any attack even if only partially successful could disrupt our networks increase response time negatively impact our ability to meet our our contracted service level obligations and generally hamper our ability to provide reliable service to our registry services customers and the broader internet community further we sell ddos protection services to security services customers although we increase our knowledge of and develop new techniques in the identification and mitigation of attacks through the protection of our security services customers the ddos protection services share some of the infrastructure used in our registry services business therefore the provision of such services might expose our critical registry services infrastructure to temporary degradations or outages caused by very largescale ddos attacks against those customers in addition to any directed specifically against us and our networks 

changes to the present multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

the internet is governed under a multistakeholder model comprising civil society the private sector including forprofit and notforprofit organizations such as icann governments including the us government academia nongovernmental organizations and international organizations changes to the present multistakeholder model of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business 

role of icann  icann plays a central coordination role in the multistakeholder system icann is mandated by the nonbinding aoc between the doc and icann to uphold a private sectorled multistakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit if icann fails to uphold or significantly redefines the multistakeholder model it could harm our business and our relationship with icann additionally the aoc could be terminated or replaced with a different agreement between icann and some other authority which may establish new or different procedures for internet governance that may be unfavorable to us also legal regulatory or other challenges could be brought challenging the legal authority underlying the roles and actions of icann 

role of foreign governments  some governments and members of the multistakeholder community have questioned icann’s role with respect to internet governance and as a result could seek a multilateral oversight body as a replacement additionally the role of icann’s governmental advisory committee which is comprised of representatives of national governments could change giving governments more control of internet governance for example the aoc established several multiparty review panels and contemplates a greater involvement by foreign governments and governmental authorities in the oversight and review of icann these periodic review panels may take positions that are unfavorable to us some governments and governmental authorities outside the us have in the past disagreed and may in the future disagree with the actions policies or programs of icann the us government and us relating to the dns 

role of the us government  the us government through the ntia coordinates the management of important aspects of the dns including the iana functions and the root zone on march 14 2014 ntia announced its intent to transition its oversight of the iana function to the global multistakeholder community ntia asked icann to convene global stakeholders to develop a proposal to transition the current role played by ntia in the coordination of the dns the ntia is also coordinating a related and parallel transition of related root zone management functions these related root zone management functions involve our role as root zone maintainer under the cooperative agreement at ntia’s request we submitted a proposal with icann to ntia as how best to remove ntia’s administrative role associated with root zone management in a manner that maintains the security stability and resiliency of the internet’s domain name system we have performed the root zone maintainer functions as a community service spanning three decades without compensation at the request of the doc under the cooperative agreement while it is uncertain how the transition of oversight of the iana functions and related root 

zone management functions will affect our role as root zone maintainer it is anticipated that performance of the root zone management function would be conducted by us under a new root zone management agreement with icann once the root zone management function obligations under the cooperative agreement are completed although our root zone maintainer function is separate from our registry agreements there can be no assurance that the transition of the iana functions the transition of the related root zone management functions and associated transition processes will not negatively impact our business 

as a result of these and other risks internet governance may change in ways that could materially harm our registry services business for example after the transition if we perform the root zone management function under a new agreement we may be subject to claims challenging the agreement and we may not have immunity from or sufficient indemnification for such claims if another party is designated to perform the root zone maintainer function there could be new or increased risks in publishing the root zone file which is critical to the operation of the dns and our operation of our tlds including com  additionally it may become more difficult for us to introduce new services in our registry services business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how our business is conducted or to fees or taxes applicable to this business which may not be equally applicable to our competitors 

we operate two root zone servers and are contracted to perform the root zone maintainer function under icann’s new gtld program we face increased risk from these operations 

we administer and operate two of the 13 root zone servers root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and dns configuration data necessary to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet under the cooperative agreement we play a key operational role in support of the iana function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative data for the root zone itself multiple times daily and distribute it to all root server operators 

under its new gtld program icann has recommended delegations into the root zone of a large number of new gtlds in view of our role as the root zone maintainer and as a root server operator we face increased risks should icann’s delegation of these new gtlds which represent unprecedented changes to the root zone in volume and frequency cause security and stability problems within the dns andor for parties who rely on the dns such risks include potential instability of the dns including potential fragmentation of the dns should icann’s delegations create sufficient instability and potential claims based on our role in the root zone provisioning and delegation process these risks alone or in the aggregate have the potential to cause serious harm to our registry services business further our business could also be harmed through security stability and resiliency degradation if the delegation of new gtlds into the root zone causes problems to certain components of the dns ecosystem or other aspects of the global dns or other relying parties are negatively impacted as a result of domain name collisions or other new gtld security issues such as exposure or other leakage of private or sensitive information 

additionally dnssec enabled in the root zone and at other levels of the dns require new preventative maintenance functions and operational practices that did not exist prior to the introduction of dnssec any failure by verisign or the iana functions operator to comply with stated practices such as those outlined in relevant dnssec practice statements introduces risk to dnssec relying parties and other internet users and consumers of the dns which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the evolution of internet practices and behaviors and the adoption of substitute technologies may impact the demand for domain names 

domain names and the domain name system have been used by consumers to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity for many years the introduction of new technologies such as social media mobile devices apps and the dominance of search engines has evolved and changed the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses alike these changes can impact the demand for domain names by those who purchase domain names for both commercial and investment reasons factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will monetize their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business 

some domain name registrants use a domain name to access or disseminate information conduct ecommerce and develop an online identity currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser the use of an app on their smart phone or mobile device the use of a voice recognition technology such as siri cortana or echo or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet users’ preferences or practices continue to shift away from directly typing in web addresses through use of new and existing technologies iii internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of 

applications to locate and access content or iv internet users were to increasingly use third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names could decrease this may trigger current customers and parties in our target markets to reevaluate their need for registration or renewal of domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo baidu and bing have and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past changed and may change in the future its search algorithm which may decrease site traffic to certain websites and provide less payperclick compensation for certain types of websites this has made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

if any of the above factors negatively impact the renewal of domain names or the demand for new domain names we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

we target many new developing and emerging markets to grow our business these markets are rapidly evolving and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely used or accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance or adoption of our services in these markets include the following 

 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

we may face operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann and our provision of backend registry services 

more than 840 new gtlds have already been delegated in this initial round of new gtlds icann plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain as set forth in the verisign labs technical report 1130007 version 22 new gtld security and stability considerations released on march 28 2013 and reiterated in our further publications since then we continue to believe there are issues regarding the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our and others’ efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all for example domain name collisions have been reported to icann which have resulted in various network interruptions for enterprises as well as confusion and usability issues that have led to phishing attacks it is anticipated that as additional new gtlds are delegated more domain name collisions and associated security issues will occur 

we have entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for new gtlds we may face risks regarding icann requirements for mitigating name collisions in the new gtlds which we operate or for which we provide backend registry services for example the possibility exists that “controlled interruption” periods may disrupt network services or that privacy or secure communications may be impacted as a result of insufficient preparedness by icann and the community for the launch of new gtlds 

our agreements to provide backend registry services directly to other applicants and indirectly through reseller relationships expose us to operational and other risks for example the increase in the number of gtlds for which we provide 

registry services on a standalone basis or as a backend service provider could further increase costs or increase the frequency or scope of targeted attacks from nefarious actors 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer lower demand for our products price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market position we must continually improve our access to technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or launch entirely new products and services such as new gtlds in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish a web presence we have applied for new gtlds including certain idn gtlds however there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be any more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the new gtlds including our new gtlds may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn gtlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well as a result of these challenges it is possible that resolution of names within some of these new gtlds may be blocked within certain state or organizational environments challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability on the internet 

see the “competition” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we must establish and maintain strong relationships with registrars and their resellers to maintain their focus on marketing our products and services otherwise our registry service business could be harmed 

one registrar accounts for more than 30 of our revenues all of our domain name registrations occur through registrars and their resellers registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars have chosen to and may continue to choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms our registrars and resellers not only sell domain name registrations of other competing registries but also sell and support their own services for websites such as email website hosting as well as other services to the extent that registrars and their resellers focus more on selling support services and less on the registration and renewal of our tlds our revenues could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully market our services to and build and maintain strong relationships with new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent if we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling our tlds as opposed to other competing tlds or their own services our business could be harmed 

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 15 

 most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to our primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for such interruptions or for potential losses arising from terrorism 

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control in addition if these service providers do not protect maintain improve and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the dns through their networks our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation of our tld name servers the domain name root zone servers the root zone management system or other events could result in a dns resolution or other service outage or in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services in conformance with industry best practices the failure could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period a failure in the operation or update of the root zone file or the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could also result in the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those tlds for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server any of these problems or outages could create potential liability including liability arising from a failure to meet our service level agreements in our registry agreements and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

an unstable global economic social and political environment including hostilities and conflicts in various regions both inside and outside the us natural disasters currency fluctuations and country specific operating regulations may have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations the economic social and political environment has impacted or may negatively impact among other things 

 in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may have a disproportionate negative impact on our business 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic and political risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the us doing business in international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or 

we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could materially harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

 

we rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our registry services business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold in addition us and most other countries’ trademark laws currently do not permit the registration of tlds such as com  and net  as trademarks accordingly we may not be able to fully realize or maintain the value of these intellectual property assets 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

we cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties the international use of our logo could present additional potential risks for third party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

a third party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses including patents related to software and business methods are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits and investigations including with respect to the root zone maintainer agreement now under negotiation with icann such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in lawsuits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such investigations claims and lawsuits could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exploring a variety of possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the investment in and the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings including the acquisition andor launch of new gtlds initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio our security services business backend registry services and idn gtlds 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel possible regulatory scrutiny or thirdparty claims possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative as well as damage to our reputation if we are unsuccessful in pursuing a strategic initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net   name  and other registries including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all any strategic initiative to leverage our patent portfolio will likely increase litigation risks from potential licensees and we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we operate in a unique competitive and highly regulated environment and we depend on the knowledge experience and performance of our senior management team and other key employees in this regard and otherwise we have experienced changes in our management team during the last few years if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these key individuals and additional highly skilled technical sales and marketing and other experienced employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer for example our service products are highly technical and require individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique platforms and software implementation 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned in low tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates 

as described further in “note 11 income taxes of our notes to consolidated financial statements” in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k we claimed a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2013 an income tax benefit of 3753 million net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions recorded as required under us gaap this worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the internal revenue service “irs” which could result in the reversal of all part or none of the income tax benefit if the irs rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction we may have to pay additional cash income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive if any will be 

various legislative proposals that would reform us corporate tax laws have been proposed by the obama administration as well as members of congress including proposals that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we are unable to predict whether these or other proposals will be implemented although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense or cash flow 

our foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested offshore constitute a majority of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and there is a high cost associated with a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion or a repatriation of those funds to the us 

a majority of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore and are not available to be used in the us for working capital needs debt obligations acquisitions share repurchases dividends or other general corporate purposes in the event that funds from our foreign operations are needed in the us for any purpose we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate those funds which could be significant further if we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings our effective tax rate would increase these could adversely impact our business valuation and stock price 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

as of december 31 2015 we had 19 billion in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 17 billion was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the us debt ceiling crisis and the eurozone crisis which affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues during the 2008 financial crisis the volatility and disruption in the global credit market reached unprecedented levels if the global credit market deteriorates again or other events negatively impact the market for us treasury securities our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in dulles virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including 

 we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

as of december 31 2015 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1101 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 137 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding equity and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of our 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 “subordinated convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of outstanding debt and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness including any future indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations or to arrange alternative liquidity sources to make principal and interest payments when due or to repurchase or settle our debt if triggered by certain corporate events certain events of default or conversion it could also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry or make required capital expenditures and investments in our business make it difficult or more expensive to refinance our debt or obtain new debt trigger an event of default and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions some of our debt contains covenants which may limit our operating flexibility including restrictions on share repurchases dividends prepayment or repurchase of debt acquisitions disposing of assets if we do not continue to meet certain financial ratios any rating assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency which could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future the settlement amount contingent interest and potential recapture of income tax deductions related to our subordinated convertible debentures can be substantial and can increase significantly based on changes in our stock price the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition

overview 

we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet security enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world our registry services ensure the security stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services including the  com and  net domains two of the internet’s root servers and the operation of the root zone maintainer function for the core of the internet’s dns our product suite also includes security services which was formerly known as network intelligence and availability or nia services consisting of ddos protection services idefense services and managed dns services 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 1398 million domain names registered in the domain name base for  com and net  our principal registries the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access as well as marketing activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars growth in the number of domain names under our management may be hindered by certain factors including overall economic conditions competition from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users and how they navigate the internet as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will monetize their investment in domain names can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result we must evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our subordinated convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on stock price bond price risk free interest rates volatility and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

earnings per share 

we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our subordinated convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share under this method only a positive conversion spread related to the subordinated convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the ifconverted method which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com  and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered with the  com and  net registries we receive a fee from thirdparty registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with thirdparty registrars or their resellers and the thirdparty registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users as well as marketing activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars we increased the annual fee for a net domain name registration from 562 to 618 on february 1 2014 from 618 to 679 on february 1 2015 and from 679 to 746 on february 1 2016 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our net agreement with icann through june 30 2017 the annual fee for a com domain name registration is fixed at 785 for the duration of the current com registry agreement through november 30 2018 except that prices may be raised by up to 7 each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability each as defined in the  com registry agreement of the dns subject to approval of the doc we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for  com and  net registrations are in us dollars revenues from security services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues 

  

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares the domain name base for  com  and net  managed by our registry services business   



 

2015 compared to 2014 revenues increased by 492 million  primarily due to a 6 increase in the number of domain names ending in  com and  net  and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2014 and 2015 total revenue growth of 5 was slightly less than the 6 growth in the domain name base due to the timing of registrations throughout the year as a significant portion of new registrations occurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 

2014 compared to 2013 revenues increased by 450 million  primarily due to a 3 increase in the domain name base for  com and  net and increases in the net domain name registration fees in july 2013 and february 2014 

growth in the domain name base was primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars however ongoing economic uncertainty competitive pressure from cctlds the introduction of new gtlds ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants and how they will monetize their investment in domain names has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2016 and beyond during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 we experienced an increase in the level of new domain name registrations in our apac region primarily from our registrars in china this higher volume of new registrations appears to have reverted back to a more typical pace by the end of 2015 

we expect revenues will continue to increase in 2016 as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2015 continued growth in the domain name base in 2016 and increases in the net domain name registration fees in february 2015 and 2016 

geographic revenues 

we generate revenue in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” apac and certain other countries including canada and latin american countries 

  

the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



although revenues continued to grow in the more mature markets of the us and emea the emerging markets in the apac region saw the highest percentage growth rate in 2015 because of strong demand for domain names especially in china revenues for our registry services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region these factors reflect higher revenue growth in emea and lower revenue growth in apac during 2014 and declining revenue in the other region in 2015 and 2014 

  

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  



2015 compared to 2014 cost of revenues increased by 44 million primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses and registry fee expenses partially offset by decreases in telecommunications expenses and depreciation expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount and increases in salary bonus and allocated benefit expenses registry fees due to icann increased by 27 million resulting from an increase in the volume of com registrations and renewals telecommunication expenses decreased by 18 million primarily due to savings on renewals of colocation agreements depreciation expenses decreased by 16 million due to lower capital spending for equipment replacement in 2014 and 2015 

2014 compared to 2013 cost of revenues increased slightly primarily due to increases in allocated overhead expenses and depreciation expenses allocated overhead expenses increased by 18 million primarily due to an increase in allocable indirect costs depreciation expenses increased by 15 million primarily due to an increase in hardware and equipment purchases to support our network infrastructure in recent years 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses gtld application costs trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



2015 compared to 2014 sales and marketing expenses decreased by 18 million primarily due to a decrease in advertising and consulting expenses partially offset by an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses advertising and consulting expenses decreased by 32 million primarily due to a decrease in marketing activities and advertising agency costs salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 14 million primarily resulting from an increase in average headcount 

2014 compared to 2013 sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and marketing expenses and stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses advertising and marketing expenses increased by 27 million primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses for product marketing initiatives promoting registry and security services and an increase in general corporate marketing expenses stockbased compensation expenses increased by 18 million primarily due to additional expense recognized for certain performancebased rsus which was recorded based on their periodend fair value as well as an increase in expense related to higher expected attainment levels for performancebased rsus granted in 2013 and 2014 and lower expense recognized during 2013 as a result of lower actual attainment level for performancebased rsus granted in 2012 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 20 million primarily due to a decrease in strategy consulting costs related to new gtlds and other marketing research expenses 

  

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2016 as compared to 2015 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



2015 compared to 2014 research and development expenses decreased by 41 million primarily due to a decrease in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses contractors and professional services expenses and allocated overhead costs salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses decreased by 21 million due to a decrease in average headcount contract and professional services expenses decreased due to lower consulting costs on various research and development projects allocated overhead costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in proportional headcount compared to other cost types 

2014 compared to 2013 research and development expenses decreased primarily due to a 17 million decrease in contract and professional services expenses from lower consulting costs on various development projects as we have shifted more development work to our employees 

  

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2016 as compared to 2015 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

2015 compared to 2014 general and administrative expenses increased by 92 million primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses legal expenses and miscellaneous expenses partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation increased by 43 million due to annual salary increases and increased expenses related to employee benefits stock based compensation expense increased due to an increase in expense related to performancebased rsus and the impact of new rsu grants which had a higher grant date fair value due to the increase in our stock price partially offset by additional expense recognized in 2014 for certain performancebased rsus which were recorded based on their periodend fair value legal expenses increased by 33 million primarily due to an increase in services performed by external legal counsel miscellaneous expenses increased by 40 million primarily due to expenses for certain nonincome related taxes in 2015 and certain expense reversals in 2014 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 26 million due to a decrease in consulting costs supporting various corporate functions

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2016 as compared to 2015 

interest expense 

see note 5 “debt and interest expense” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k we expect interest expense to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to a full year of interest expense related to the senior notes issued in march 2015 

nonoperating income net 

see note 10 “nonoperating income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

income tax expense benefit 

our effective tax rate for 2015 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by state income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2014 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by state income taxes and net income tax expense of 98 million due to a nonus income tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to a reorganization of certain international operations and changes in estimates during 2014 for us income taxes related to the 2013 worthless stock deduction and the 2014 repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries 

during 2013 we liquidated for tax purposes one of our domestic subsidiaries which allowed us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return we recorded an income tax benefit during 2013 of 3753 million  related to the worthless stock deduction net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions during 2013 we also recorded an income tax expense of 1671 million for taxable income generated in the us related to the 2014 repatriation 

our effective tax rate for 2013 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from the worthless stock deduction net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions and tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by the expense related to the repatriation of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and state income taxes 

as of december 31 2015  we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 2754 million  net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss “nol” carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards decreased in 2015 as a portion of the nol and tax credit carryforwards were utilized to offset 2015 taxable income 

we qualified for two tax holidays in switzerland the tax holidays provide reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of foreign source income one of the tax holidays is effective through december 31 2016 and upon expiration may be subject to renewal if certain criteria are satisfied the other tax holiday in switzerland which became effective in 2015 is indefinite unless certain thresholds are no longer met an additional tax holiday in switzerland expired in 2014 and was not extended these tax holidays increased our earnings per share by 014  050  and  018  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2015  our principal source of liquidity was 2287 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 17 billion  of marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days as of december 31 2015  all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “cash cash equivalents and marketable securities” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2015 the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 12 billion our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and accordingly we have not provided deferred us taxes for these funds in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the us and if us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds as of december 31 2015  the amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred income taxes have not been provided was 6670 million 

in 2015 purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities were 4523 million in 2014 and 2013 proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases were 1516 million and 590 million respectively 

in 2015  we repurchased 93 million  shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 6659  for an aggregate cost of 6219 million under our share buyback program in 2014  we repurchased 163 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 5315 for an aggregate cost of 8671 million in 2013  we repurchased 210 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 4865 for an aggregate cost of 10 billion as of december 31 2015  there was 4545 million remaining for future share repurchases under our share buyback program 

on march 27 2015 we issued 5000 million of 525 senior unsecured notes due april 1 2025 the proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes including but not limited to the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program on march 31 2015 we entered into a new 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility this facility will expire in 2020 and takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015  there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 

as of december 31 2015 we had 125 billion principal amount outstanding of our subordinated convertible debentures the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2015 accordingly the subordinated convertible debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through march 31 2016 we do not expect a material amount of the subordinated convertible debentures to be converted in the near term as the trading price of the debentures exceeds the value that is likely to be received upon conversion however we cannot provide any assurance that the trading price of the debentures will continue to exceed the value that would be derived upon conversion or that the holders will not elect to convert the subordinated convertible debentures if a holder elects to convert its subordinated convertible debentures we are permitted under the indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the conversion value as defined in the indenture in cash stock or a combination thereof if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of conversion we currently have the intent and the ability based on current facts and circumstances to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash however if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures that holders actually elect to convert exceeds our cash on hand and cash 

from operations we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert 

we paid contingent interest of 52 million in february 2015 and 55 million in august 2015 in addition to the normal coupon interest to holders of record of the subordinated convertible debentures in august 2015 the upside trigger on the subordinated convertible debentures was met for the six month interest period from august 15 2015 through february 15 2016 on february 15 2016 we paid contingent interest of 65 million in addition to the normal coupon interest to holders of record of the subordinated convertible debentures as of february 1 2016 in february 2016 the upside trigger on the subordinated convertible debentures was met for the six month interest period from february 15 2016 through august 14 2016 on august 15 2016 we will pay contingent interest of 68 million in addition to the normal coupon interest to holders of record of the subordinated convertible debentures as of august 1 2016 the upside trigger is met if the subordinated convertible debentures’ average trading price is at least 150 of par during the 10 trading days before each semiannual interest period the upside trigger is tested semiannually for the following six months the semiannual upside contingent interest payment for a given period can be approximated by applying the annual rate of 05 to the aggregate market value of all outstanding subordinated convertible debentures and dividing by two for that semiannual period payment amount 

during 2014 we repatriated approximately 7409 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes of 281 million we utilized substantially all of the remaining net operating losses generated from the 2013 worthless stock deduction to offset 2014 taxable income including the taxable income recognized in the us as a result of the repatriation 

on april 16 2013 we issued 7500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior unsecured notes due in may 2023 we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the 1000 million of outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility the remaining portion of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of shares under our share buyback program 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

2015  compared to 2014   cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations cash paid for interest increased as a result of the contingent interest paid to holders of the subordinated convertible debentures and the additional interest paid on the 5000 million senior notes issued in march 2015 

2014 compared to 2013  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and cash paid to employees and vendors cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations during 2014 cash paid for interest increased due to the issuance of the senior notes in april 2013 payments to employees and vendors increased primarily due to an increase in operating expenses 

net cash used in provided by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment 

  

2015  compared to 2014  the change in cash used in provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities partially offset by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities 

  

2014 compared to 2013 the change in cash used in provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities net of purchases of marketable securities and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from and repayment of borrowings stock option exercises our employee stock purchase plan “espp” and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

  

2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in 2015 a decrease in share repurchases and higher recognized excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation partially offset by lower proceeds from stock option exercises and espp 

2014 compared to 2013 net cash used in financing activities increased due to the proceeds received in 2013 from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercises and espp as well as lower recognized excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases and the repayment of borrowings under our credit facility in 2013 

impact of inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented 

  

income taxes 

we derive significant tax savings from the subordinated convertible debentures during 2015 and 2014 the interest deduction for income tax purposes related to our subordinated convertible debentures excluding contingent interest was 1648 million and 1549 million respectively compared to coupon interest expense of 406 million for each of the same periods for income tax purposes we deduct interest expense on the subordinated convertible debentures calculated at 85 of the adjusted issue price subject to adjustment for actual versus projected contingent interest the adjusted issue price and consequently the interest deduction for income tax purposes grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken using a comparable yield of 85 on the adjusted issue price and the coupon rate of 325 on the principal amount compounded annually interest recognized in accordance with gaap which is calculated at 839 of the liability component of the subordinated convertible debentures will also grow over the term but at a slower rate this difference will result in a continuing increase in the deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the subordinated convertible debentures ie the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date depending on the settlement amount for the subordinated convertible debentures at the settlement date the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial which could adversely impact our cash flow 

we do not expect to pay us federal income taxes during 2016 as a result of the interest deduction on our subordinated convertible debentures the use of foreign tax credits and research tax credits and the remaining overpayment from prior years we expect the amount of cash paid for nonus income taxes in 2016 to decrease compared to 2015 as nonus income taxes paid in 2015 included a charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations 

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2016 are anticipated to be between 400 million and 500 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 12 “commitments and contingencies ” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k   

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

dilution from subordinated convertible debentures rsus and stock options 

the conversion of our subordinated convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the subordinated convertible debentures we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount “the conversion spread” may be settled in shares of common stock as of december 31 2015  there are 364 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the subordinated convertible debentures based on the ifconverted value of the subordinated convertible debentures as of december 31 2015  the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to 221 million shares of common stock 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2015  there are a total of 21 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of 19 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of rsu grants to employees however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

our marketable securities consist primarily of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2015  we had 17 billion  of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2015  we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 325 million  to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

    

market risk management 

  

the fair market values of our subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the subordinated convertible debentures are subject to market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures the fair market value will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes as of december 31 2015  the fair value of the subordinated convertible debentures was approximately 32 billion and the fair values of the senior notes issued in 2013 and the senior notes issued in 2015 were 7420 million  and 5038 million  respectively based on available market information from public data sources 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on subordinated convertible debentures is also subject to market risk and to a lesser extent to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will increase or decrease with the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures

registry services 

  

registry services operates the authoritative directory of all com net cc tv and  name  domain names and the backend systems for all  gov  jobs  and edu domain names among others registry services allows individuals and organizations to establish their online identities while providing the secure alwayson access they need to communicate and transact reliably with largescale online audiences 

  

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net  and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com  agreement the us department of commerce “doc” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names in these tlds eg johndoecom and janedoenet our global constellation of domain name servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the tv  and cc  country code toplevel domains “cctlds” and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs  and edu gtlds among others these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system 

  

with our existing gtlds and cctlds we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language currently idns may be registered in as many as 350 different native languages and scripts 

  

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years and the fees charged for com and net may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term with respect to  com price increases require prior approval by the doc according to the terms of amendment 32 of the cooperative agreement between the doc and verisign revenues for registrations of name  are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those applicable to com  and  net    however name fees charged are subject to our agreement with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc  and tv  domain names are based on a similar fee system and registration system though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration “gsa” the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the registry operator of jobs no fees are received from operating the edu  registry infrastructure 

historically we have experienced higher domain name growth in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance the effect of this seasonality has historically resulted in the largest amount of growth in our deferred revenue balance occurring during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters

as part of our operations infrastructure for our registry services business we operate all authoritative domain name servers that answer domain name lookups for the com  and net  zones as well as for the other tlds for which we are the registry we also administer and operate two of the 13 root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy our domain name servers provide the associated authoritative name servers and ip addresses for every com  and net  domain name on the internet and a large number of other tld queries resulting in an average of over 110 billion transactions per day these name servers are located in resolution sites which are in a controlled and monitored environment incorporating security and system maintenance features this network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the internet’s dns infrastructure 

in 2013 and 2014 we continued to expand our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to accommodate projected internet attack trends

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we seek to expand our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target growth in the  com  and  net  domain name base particularly in emerging international markets and by extending our brand and serving new markets through the idns for which we have applied we market our nia services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including direct sales and indirect channels we have marketing and sales offices throughout the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and nia services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2014 2013 and 2012 our research and development expenses were 678 million 703 million and 617 million respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline in conjunction we also continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in each of the registry services and nia services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

competition in registry services   we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish a web presence in addition to the three gtlds we operate  com   net  and  name  and the 18 other operational gtlds delegated before october 23 2013 there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and more than 40 idn cctld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements 

with icann which result in registrars or their resellers giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

in addition on october 23 2013 the doc began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds icann is executing registry agreements with new gtld applicants awarding over 1300 new gtlds in an initial round under its new gtld program and plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain for additional information about the potential risks presented by these new gtlds see “we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows” 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited ari registry services donuts inc and rightside inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google microsoft and yahoo operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

us and most other countries’ trademark laws do not permit the registration of tlds such as com  and net  as trademarks accordingly verisign’s ability to prevent other registries from using the  com  and  net  brand in their marketing materials may be limited 

competition in nia services several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully in addition it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites 

we face competition in the network intelligence and availability services industry from companies or services such as isight partners ibm xforce secunia aps dell secureworks mcafee inc akamai technologies inc including their acquisition of 

prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc neustar inc opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc and afilias limited 

industry regulation 

  

registry services within the us government oversight of the dns is provided by the doc effective october 1 2009 the doc and icann entered into a new agreement known as the “affirmation of commitments” which replaced the seventh amendment of the original memorandum of understanding and known as the joint project agreement under the affirmation of commitments the doc became one of several parties working together with other representative constituency members in providing an ongoing review of icann’s performance and accountability the affirmation of commitments sets forth a periodic review process by committees which provide for more international and multidiscipline participation these review panels are charged with reviewing and making recommendations regarding i the accountability and transparency of icann ii the security stability and resiliency of the dns iii the impact of new gtlds on competition consumer trust and consumer choice and iv the effectiveness of icann’s policies with respect to registrant data in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust under the affirmation of commitments the assistant secretary of communications and information of the doc will be a member of the “accountability and transparency” review panel individual reviews from each panel generally are to occur no less than every three to four years

some of the services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable us export law as the list of products and countries requiring export approval expands or changes government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals or we violate applicable laws we may not be able to provide some of our services in international markets and may be subject to fines and other penalties 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the us and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property we continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for the verisign mark and new verisign logo in the us and certain countries and have pending trademark applications for the new verisign logo in a number of other countries we have common law rights in other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services 

  

with regard to our naming services businesses our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our naming services businesses and certain methodologies many of which are patented or for which patent applications are pending and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses we own our proprietary shared registration system through which registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on open standards set by organizations such as the internet engineering task force “ietf” to the extent any of our patents are considered “standard essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business which closed on august 9 2010 the “closing date” symantec acquired all trademarks primarily used in our authentication services business including our checkmark logo and the geotrust and thawte brand names and we granted symantec a fiveyear license in connection with the verisigncom website the verisigncom website will be operated by symantec for a period of five years following the closing date subject to certain rights of verisign including the right to include links to subdomains operated by us 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function 



we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

  risks relating to our business 

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

 our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from most of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenses which are expensed in full when incurred 

any or all of the above factors could impact our revenues and operating results therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

an unstable global economic social and political environment including the ongoing hostilities in the middle east and ukraine natural disasters conflicts in europe currency fluctuations country specific operating regulations and potential fallout from the disclosures related to the us internet and communications surveillance may have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations for example recently the ongoing challenging economic conditions in europe have possibly limited the rate of growth of the domain name base and may continue to do so in the future more generally the economic social and political environment has or may negatively impact among other things 

 in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may further negatively impact our business if the market economic social and political conditions in the us and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

the successful operation of our business depends on numerous factors   

the successful operation of our business depends on numerous factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

 substantially all of our revenue is derived from our registry services business limitations on our ability to raise prices on domain name registrations and any failure to renew key agreements could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our registry services business which derives most of its revenues from registration fees for domain names generates substantially all of our revenue if there is a disruption in the registry services business including any disruption from changes in the domain name industry changes in or challenges to our agreements with icann including any changes resulting from legal challenges to these agreements changes in our customers’ or internet users’ preferences a downturn in the economy or changes in technology related to the use of domain names there may be a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition a failure of the doc to approve the renewal of the com  registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2018 could have a material adverse effect on our business 

under the terms of the cooperative agreement the company has the right to petition for potential relief from the  com  registry agreement’s pricing restrictions however there is uncertainty whether the doc will approve any exercise by the company of its right to increase the price per com  domain name registration under certain circumstances and whether the company will be able to successfully demonstrate to the doc that market conditions warrant removal of the pricing restrictions on com  domain name registrations each of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

there is also uncertainty of future revenue and profitability and potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to the potential increase in expenses and costs coupled with such factors as restrictions on increasing prices due to market conditions under the com  registry agreement and the cooperative agreement or otherwise or any other changes to pricing terms in these agreements upon renewal 

issues arising from our agreements with icann the doc and the gsa could harm our registry services business 

we are parties to agreements i with the doc with respect to certain aspects of the dns ii with icann and the doc as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com gtld and iii with icann with respect to being the exclusive registry for the net and name gtlds 

we face risks arising from our agreements with icann and the doc including the following 

 in addition under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar historically all gtld registry operators were subject to this vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby these registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal in some instances additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities furthermore unless prohibited by icann as noted above such vertical integration restrictions do not generally apply to cctld operators 

the impact of these changes to the distribution channel is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business if operators of new or existing gtlds are able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration if verisign were to seek removal of the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements with respect to existing gtlds or in the future with respect to new gtlds it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc approval would be obtained 

challenges to internet administration or changes to our pricing terms could harm our registry services business 

risks we face from challenges by third parties including governmental authorities in the us and other countries to our role in the ongoing operation of the internet include 

 13 

the internet community if icann fails to uphold or significantly redefines the multistakeholder model by expanding the role of governments in the governmental advisory committee for example it could harm our business and our relationship with icann 

 as a result of these and other risks it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our registry services business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted which may not also apply to our competitors 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

as of december 31 2014 we had 124 or 12 of our employees outside the us doing business in international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business including potentially material business operations in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems investigations fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the us and overseas may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations in the us or overseas to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling especially as we consider providing nia services and registry services to this sector counterfeit goods and cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have contracts pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and even though these contracts are immaterial they impose compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation which could be significant to the company 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

we operate two root zone servers and are contracted to perform the root zone maintainer function under icann’s new gtld program we face increased risk from these operations 

we administer and operate two of the 13 root zone servers root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and dns configuration data necessary to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet under the cooperative agreement with the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” of the doc we play a key operational role in support of the internet assigned numbers authority “iana” function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative data for the root zone itself multiple times daily and distribute it to all root server operators 

under its new gtld program icann intends to recommend for delegation into the root zone over 1300 new gtlds potentially within a compressed timeframe on october 23 2013 ntia began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds in view of our role as the root zone maintainer and as a root operator we face increased risks should icann’s delegation of these new gtlds cause security and stability problems within the dns andor for parties who rely on the dns such risks include potential instability of the dns including potential fragmentation of the dns should icann’s delegations create sufficient instability and potential claims based on our role in the root zone provisioning and delegation process these risks alone or in the aggregate have the potential to cause serious harm to our registry services business further our business could also be harmed through security stability and resiliency degradation if the delegation of new gtlds into the root zone causes problems to certain components of the dns ecosystem or other aspects of the global dns or other relying parties are negatively impacted as a result of domain name collisions such as exposure or other leakage of private or sensitive information 

additionally dns security extensions “dnssec” enabled in the root zone and at other levels of the dns require new preventative maintenance functions and operational practices that did not exist prior to the introduction of dnssec any failure by verisign or the iana functions operator to comply with stated practices such as those outlined in relevant dnssec practice statements introduces risk to dnssec relying parties and other internet users and consumers of the dns which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

on march 14 2014 the national telecommunications and information administration announced its intent to transition key internet domain name functions potentially impacting our root zone maintainer function 

on march 14 2014 ntia announced its intent to transition its oversight of the iana function to the global multistakeholder community ntia asked icann to convene global stakeholders to develop a proposal to transition the current role played by ntia in the coordination of the dns it is uncertain whether the transition of oversight of the iana function will affect our role as root zone maintainer although our root zone maintainer function is separate from our registry services business and the ntia announcement does not affect verisigns operation of the  com net  and  name  registries there can be no assurance that the transition will not negatively impact our business 

changes in internet user behavior either as a result of evolving technologies or user practices may impact the demand for domain names 

currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet search engines were to change the value of their algorithms on the use of a domain for finding a website iii internet users’ preferences or practices continue to shift away from directly typing in web addresses iv internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content or v internet users were to increasingly use third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names could decrease 

changes in the level of spending on online advertising andor the way that online networks compensate owners of websites could impact the demand for domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo baidu and bing have and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past changed and may change in the future its search algorithm which may decrease site traffic to certain websites and payperclick advertising policies to provide less compensation for advertising on certain types of websites this has made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

changes in federal or state tax laws and regulations may discourage the registration or renewal of domain names for ecommerce 

many internet merchants are not currently required to collect sales taxes in respect of shipments of goods into states where they lack physical presence however state tax laws and regulations may change in the future and one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on outofstate companies that engage in online commerce several states have enacted “affiliate nexus” laws which require online retailers without a physical presence in the state to begin collecting sales taxes if a significant number of local sales are generated by brick and mortar affiliates operating in the state in addition it is possible that national legislation may be enacted requiring online retailers with greater than 1 million in sales in a state but without any physical presence in the state to begin collecting sales taxes for that state legislation called the marketplace fairness act of 2013 s 743 which would have done this passed the senate in 2013 but no action was taken by the house of representatives prior to the 20132014 congressional term it is expected that a new version of the marketplace fairness act will be introduced in 2015 but it is unclear if this new version will have any greater chance of passage than s 743 did in the prior congressional term the enactment of any such state or federal laws may impair the growth of ecommerce and discourage the registration or renewal of domain names for ecommerce 

reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes among registrars or their resellers as a result of consolidation or changes in ownership management or strategy could harm our registry services business 

registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names our registry services business which generates substantially all of our revenue derives most of its revenues from registrations and renewals of domain names and decreased demand for andor renewals of domain names could cause a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or contract claims increased insurance costs or increased service costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as more broadly on internet users and consumers and thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to our primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for such interruptions or for potential losses arising from terrorism 

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our shared registration system residing in our secure data centers these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control in addition if these service providers present inconsistent data regarding the dns our business could be harmed 

a failure in the operation of our tld name servers the domain name root zone servers or other events could result in a dns resolution or other service outage or in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services recommended by us in conformance with industry best practices the failure could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period a failure in the operation or update of the root zone file or the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could also result in the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those tlds for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server any of these problems or outages could create potential liability and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

in addition a failure in our nia services could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business could suffer 

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we retain certain customer and employee information in our secure data centers and various domain name registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the company as an operator of critical internet infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat 

“apt” attacks and zerohour threats which means that the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched and may well target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist only within the target’s operating environment making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against the shared registration system the root zone servers the root zone files tld name servers and tld zone files that we operate are critical hardware and software to our registry services operations we expend significant time and money on the security of our facilities and infrastructure despite our security measures we have been subject to a security breach as disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins outages resulting from destructive malcode computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers or domain name registration systems may cause an outage of or jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for certain of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

we are frequently subject to largescale ddos attacks 

our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks of increasing size and sophistication we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against such attacks but there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any successful attack or partially successful attack could disrupt our networks increase response time and generally hamper our ability to provide reliable service to our registry services customers and the broader internet community further we sell ddos protection services to nia services customers although our contracts with these customers provide that we may prioritize all or part of these services at no liability to us in order to preserve our operational stability the provision of such services might expose our critical dns services to temporary degradations or outages caused by very largescale ddos attacks against those customers in addition to any directed specifically against us and our networks 

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our registry services business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the verisign logo in all markets where verisign products and services are sold 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

we cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties the international use of our logo could present additional potential risks for third party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

a third party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses including patents related to software and business methods are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits and investigations such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in lawsuits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such investigations claims and lawsuits could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” legal proceedings of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we must establish and maintain strategic channel and other relationships 

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts including in international markets we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our services than we would otherwise 

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

furthermore any changes by our distributors to their existing marketing strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if one or more of our distributors were to encounter financial difficulties or if there were a significant reduction in marketing expenditures by our distributors including registrars or their resellers as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on our business including a decrease in domain name registrations and renewals failure of one or more of our strategic channel or other relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars based upon their perception of market opportunity may choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms and if we are unable to maintain their focus on our products and services or move through them to engage the same registrants this could harm our business 

new entrants may disrupt the registrar industry which could have adverse effects on our business this could include but is not limited to potential harm to the business models of existing registrars impairing their ability to engage in promotional activities beneficial to the sale of domain name registrations in the tlds operated by us 

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exploring a variety of possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings or initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all any strategic initiative to leverage our patent portfolio will likely increase litigation risks from potential licensees and we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources 

the success of our nia services depends in part on the acceptance of our services 

we are investing in our nia services and the future growth of these services depends in part on the commercial success acceptance and reliability of our nia services we continually evaluate and evolve the terms and conditions upon which these services are sold these services may not experience success or acceptance as a result of changes to the terms and conditions also these services will suffer if our target customers do not adopt or use these services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our nia services or continue to use these services even after adoption 

we rely on third parties to provide products which are incorporated in our nia services 

the nia services incorporate and rely on third party hardware and software products many of which have unique capabilities if we are unable to procure these third party products the nia services may malfunction not perform as well as they should perform not perform as well as they have been performing or not perform as planned and our business could suffer 

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

our registry services and nia services businesses are developing services in emerging markets including services that involve naming and directory services other than registry and related infrastructure services these emerging markets are rapidly evolving may never gain wide acceptance and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services in these markets include the following 

 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees and we have experienced changes in our management team during the last few years if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer 

we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our swiss subsidiaries our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates 

as described further in “note 12 income taxes of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of our 2014 form 10k we claimed a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2013 an income tax benefit of 3753 million net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions recorded as required under us gaap this worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the irs which could result in the reversal of all part or none of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount recorded if the irs rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction we may have to pay additional cash income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive if any will be 

various legislative proposals that would reform us corporate tax laws have been proposed by the obama administration as well as members of congress including proposals that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we are unable to predict whether these or other proposals will be implemented although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense or cash flow 

our inability to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the projected available distributable capital reserves under applicable foreign statutes the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if these factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 

we are exposed to risks faced by financial institutions 

the hedging transactions we have entered into expose us to credit risk in the event of default by one of our counterparties despite the risk control measures we have in place a default by one of our counterparties or liquidity problems in the financial services industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

as of december 31 2014 we had 14 billion in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 12 billion was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the us debt ceiling crisis and the eurozone crisis which affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues during the 2008 financial crisis the volatility and disruption in the global credit market reached unprecedented levels if the global credit market deteriorates again or other events negatively impact the market for us treasury securities our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results results of operations and cash flows 

we may be exposed to potential risks if we do not have an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require us to report on and receive an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting despite our efforts if we were to fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results or adequately identify and reduce fraud as a result our financial condition could be harmed and current and potential future security holders could lose confidence in us andor our reported financial results which may cause a negative effect on our stock price and we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings which may be costly or divert management attention 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in dulles virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including 

 risks relating to the competitive environment in which we operate 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

general new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

competition in registry services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration andor establish a web presence in addition to the three gtlds we operate  com   net  and  name  and the 18 other operational gtlds delegated before october 23 2013 there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and more than 40 idn cctld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling marketing methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements with icann which result in registrars or their resellers giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

in addition on october 23 2013 the doc began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds icann is executing registry agreements with new gtld applicants awarding over 1300 new gtlds in an initial round under its new gtld program and plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain for additional information about the potential risks presented by these new gtlds see “we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows” 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited ari registry services donuts inc and rightside inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google microsoft and yahoo operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

us and most other countries’ trademark laws do not permit the registration of tlds such as com  and net  as trademarks accordingly verisign’s ability to prevent other registries from using the  com  and  net  brand in their marketing materials may be limited 

competition in nia services  several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully in addition it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites 

we face competition in the network intelligence and availability services industry from companies or services such as isight partners ibm xforce secunia aps dell secureworks mcafee inc akamai technologies inc including their acquisition of prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc neustar inc opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc and afilias limited 

we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new tlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds requested by country code managers resulting in the ongoing delegation of new idn cctlds to the dns root zone additionally on june 13 2012 icann announced it received 1930 applications to operate over 1400 unique new gtlds icann has begun executing registry agreements with these new gtld applicants in connection with this initial round of gtld applications and intends to continue recommending over 1300 new gtlds for delegation into the root zone on october 23 2013 the doc began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds icann plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain increased competition from these new tlds could have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows as set forth in the verisign labs technical report 1130007 version 22 new gtld security and stability considerations released on march 28 2013 and reiterated in our further publications since then we continue to believe there are issues regarding the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our and others’ efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all for example there has been an increase in domain name collisions in 2014 which have resulted in network interruptions for enterprises as well as confusion and usability issues that have led to phishing attacks we do not yet know the impact if any that these new gtlds may have on our business including if or how the introduction of these new gtlds will affect registrations for com  and net  and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

applicants for new gtlds include companies which may have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do including companies that are existing competitors domain name registrars and new entrants into the domain name industry in addition under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar historically all gtld registry operators were subject to this vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby these registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal in some instances additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities furthermore unless prohibited by icann as noted above such vertical integration restrictions do not generally apply to other cctld operators if at all 

if verisign were to seek removal of the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements with respect to existing gtlds or in the future with respect to new gtlds it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc approval would be obtained without such changes we may be at a competitive disadvantage 

we applied for 14 new gtlds including 12 idn gtlds which are transliterations of “ com ” or “ net ” in various languages we executed registry agreements to become the registry operator for 12 of these new gtlds including 11 idns as well as  comsec  the remaining idn application was for a transliteration of “ com ” in traditional chinese script which was a variant of a string we applied for in another idn application “ com ” in simplified chinese and has been withdrawn at the request of icann because icann had not yet developed a policy to address such variants we may continue with this application or a new one for the same string once icann develops and implements a policy to address variant strings the deadline to execute the registry agreement for our  verisign  application is july 29 2015 there is no certainty that we will enter into the registry agreement for  verisign  or ultimately operate any of these new gtlds 

  icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1000 which could delay the activation of some approved new gtlds even though idn gtlds have been given priority other factors related to the application process could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds further there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be any more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the new gtlds including our new gtld strings may face additional universal acceptability and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn gtlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well 

similarly while we originally entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds and applicants for approximately 170 new gtlds currently continue to contract with us to provide backend registry services there is no guarantee that such applicants with which we have entered into agreements will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds or that such new gtlds will be successful due to some or all of the factors discussed above in connection with our new gtlds we also cannot guarantee that we will ultimately provide backend registry services for all of these new gtlds icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds requires the distribution of new gtlds only through registrars who have executed the 2013 raa if registrars do not execute the 2013 raa our ability to provide backend registry services would be reduced negatively impacting the sale of our backend registry services for new gtlds even if we are able to provide such services the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of the application process and our customers’ respective launch plans for the new gtlds in addition we may face risks regarding icann requirements for mitigating name collisions in the new gtlds which we operate or for which we provide backend registry services 

our agreements to provide backend registry services directly to other applicants and indirectly through reseller relationships expose us to operational and other risks for example the increase in the number of gtlds for which we provide registry services on a standalone basis or as a backend service provider could further increase costs or increase the frequency or scope of targeted attacks from nefarious actors 

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market share we must continually improve our access to technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or launch entirely new products and services in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or anticipate or respond successfully or in a cost effective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

risks related to the sale of our authentication services business and the completion of our divestitures 

we face risks related to the terms of the sale of the authentication services business 

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business the “symantec agreement” we agreed to several terms that may pose risks to us including the potential for confusion by the public with respect to symantec’s right to use certain of our trademarks brands and domain names as well as the risk that current or potential investors in or customers of the company may incorrectly attribute to the company problems with symantec products or services that currently use the verisign brand pursuant to a license granted by the company to symantec any such confusion may have a negative impact on our reputation our brand and the market for our products and services in addition we may determine that certain assets transferred to symantec could have been useful in our naming services businesses or in other future endeavors requiring us to forego future opportunities or design or purchase alternatives which could be costly and less effective than the transferred assets 

under the terms of the symantec agreement we have licensed rights to certain of our domain name registrations to symantec we are at risk that our customers will go to a url for a licensed domain name and be unable to locate our registry or nia services in addition we will continue to maintain the registration rights for the domain names licensed to symantec for which symantec has sole control over the displayed content and we may be subject to claims of infringement if symantec posts content that is alleged to infringe the rights of a third party 

we continue to be responsible for certain liabilities following the divestiture of certain businesses 

under the agreements reached with the buyers of certain divested businesses including the authentication services business we remain liable for certain liabilities related to the divested businesses there is a possibility that we will incur unanticipated costs and expenses associated with management of liabilities relating to the businesses we have divested including requests for indemnification by the buyers of the divested businesses these liabilities could potentially relate to i breaches of contractual representations and warranties we gave to the buyers of the divested businesses or ii certain liabilities relating to the divested businesses that we retained under the agreements reached with the buyers of the divested businesses such liabilities could include certain litigation matters including actions brought by third parties where responsibility for such liabilities is to be contractually allocated to the buyer or shared with the buyer or another party it is possible that the buyer or the other party may be in default for payments for which they are responsible obligating us to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of those obligations 

risks related to our securities 

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

as of december 31 2014 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1185 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 150 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding equity and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the subordinated convertible debentures as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

as a result of the sale of the subordinated convertible debentures and our senior notes we have a substantial amount of longterm debt outstanding in addition to the subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes we have an unsecured credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 2000 million the “unsecured credit facility” and the ability to request from time to time that the lenders thereunder agree on a discretionary basis to increase the aggregate commitments amount by up to 1500 million as of december 31 2014 we had no borrowings under the unsecured credit facility 

it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations and will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks and limitations related to our level of indebtedness could intensify specifically a high level of indebtedness could have adverse effects on our flexibility to take advantage of corporate opportunities including the following 

 

in addition the indenture that governs the senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our unsecured credit facility contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control moreover in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to repay our debt obligations and us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

our unsecured credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries which are not guarantors of the senior notes or our other indebtedness repayment of our indebtedness is substantially dependent on the generation of cash flow by verisign inc our nonguarantor subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose future guarantor subsidiaries if any may not be able to or may not be permitted to on commercially reasonable terms or at all make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness such subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries on commercially reasonable terms or at all while our unsecured credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions if we cannot service our debt obligations with our cash flows and domestic cash on hand we may be required to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries which would be subject to us federal income tax or may otherwise be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of the senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our unsecured credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money certain holders of our subordinated convertible debentures could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions and create the risk of default on such indebtedness 

the credit agreement that governs our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including subject to certain exceptions restrictions on our ability to 

 27 

in addition the restrictive covenants in our unsecured credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under our unsecured credit facility or the indenture governing the senior notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under our unsecured credit facility would permit the lenders under our unsecured credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that agreement in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

some of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that appear on our consolidated balance sheet may not be available for use in our business or to meet our debt obligations without adverse income tax consequences 

as of december 31 2014 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the senior notes or our other indebtedness was 9390 million during the second quarter of 2014 we completed the repatriation of approximately 7409 million net of withholding taxes of cash held by foreign subsidiaries for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the us our intent is to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the us 

in the event that funds from our foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states or to meet our debt obligations and if us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate those funds in light of the foregoing the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that appear on our balance sheet may overstate the amount of liquidity we have available to meet our business or debt obligations including obligations under the senior notes 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control 

upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events and if the senior notes are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies that rate the senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior notes at 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date additionally under our unsecured credit facility a change of control as defined therein constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the unsecured credit facility and the commitments to lend would terminate the source of funds for any repurchase of the senior notes and repayment of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources including borrowings sales of assets or sales of equity we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due if we fail to repurchase the senior notes in that circumstance we will be in default under the indenture that governs the senior notes we may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such repurchases and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all further our ability to repurchase the senior notes may be limited by law in order to avoid the obligation to repurchase the senior notes and events of default and potential breaches of our unsecured credit facility we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us 

in addition certain important corporate events such as leveraged recapitalizations may not under the indenture that governs the senior notes constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the senior notes even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure credit ratings or the value of the senior notes additionally holders may not be able to require us to purchase their senior notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of our board of directors including a proxy contest where our board of directors approves for purposes of the change of control provisions of the indenture but does not endorse a dissident slate of directors in this regard decisions of the delaware chancery court not involving us or our securities considered a change of control redemption provision contained in an indenture governing publicly traded debt securities that was substantially similar to the change of control redemption provision in the indenture that governs the senior notes with respect to “continuing directors” in these cases the court noted that the board of directors may “approve” a dissident shareholder’s nominees solely to avoid triggering the change of control redemption provision of the indenture without 

supporting their election if the board determines in good faith that the election of the dissident nominees would not be materially adverse to the interests of the corporation or its stockholders without taking into consideration the interests of the holders of debt securities in making this determination further according to these decisions the directors’ duty of loyalty to shareholders under delaware law may in certain circumstances require them to give such approval 

furthermore the exercise by the holders of senior notes of their right to require us to repurchase the senior notes pursuant to a change of control offer could cause a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness including future agreements even if the change of control itself does not due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us in the event a change of control offer is required to be made at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing senior notes we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibitions if we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings we will remain prohibited from purchasing senior notes in that case our failure to purchase tendered senior notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture which could in turn constitute a default under our other indebtedness finally our ability to pay cash to the holders of senior notes upon a repurchase pursuant to a change of control offer may be limited by our then existing financial resources 

a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital 

any rating assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our debt securities any lowering of our rating likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future 

we may not have the ability to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures occurrence of certain events related to our subordinated convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting disclosure tax and liquidity implications 

as a result of the sale of the subordinated convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding holders of our outstanding subordinated convertible debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the subordinated convertible debentures dated as of august 20 2007 between the company and us bank national association as trustee the “2007 indenture” although in certain situations the 2007 indenture requires us to pay this repurchase price in cash we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all 

the subordinated convertible debentures continue to be convertible due to our stock price exceeding the conversion price threshold trigger and if holders elect to convert their subordinated convertible debentures we are permitted under the 2007 indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the settlement amount as defined in the 2007 indenture in cash stock or a combination thereof if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of a conversion we currently have the intent and the ability based on current facts and circumstances to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash however if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures due to holders as a result of rights to convert or require repurchase exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert or require the company to repurchase 

if we do not have adequate cash available either from cash on hand funds generated from operations or existing financing arrangements or cannot obtain additional financing arrangements we will not be able to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash and in the case of settlement of conversion elections will be required to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in stock if we settle any portion of the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in stock it will result in immediate dilution to the interests of existing security holders and the dilution could be material to such security holders 

if our intent to settle the principal amount in cash changes or if we conclude that we no longer have the ability in the future we will be required to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the ifconverted method earnings per share will most likely be lower under the ifconverted method as compared to the treasury stock method 

if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the subordinated convertible debentures ie the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions the adjusted issue price grows over the term of the subordinated convertible debentures due to the difference between the interest deduction for tax using a comparable yield rate of 85 and the coupon rate of 325 compounded annually the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date depending on the settlement amount for the subordinated convertible debentures at the settlement date the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial which could adversely impact our cash flow 

a fundamental change may constitute an event of default or prepayment under or result in the acceleration of the maturity of our thenexisting indebtedness our ability to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash or make any other required payments may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time our failure to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures when required would result in an event of default with respect to the subordinated convertible debentures

overview 

we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet security enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world our registry services ensure the security stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services including the  com  and  net  domains two of the internet’s root servers and operation of the rootzone maintainer functions for the core of the internet’s dns our product suite also includes nia services consisting of ddos protection services verisign idefense services and managed dns services as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 1306 million domain names registered under the  com and net registries our principal registries the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars growth in the number of domain names has been hindered by certain factors including changes to the marketing strategies of certain registrars overall economic conditions the introduction of new gtlds and ongoing changes to search algorithms used by google and other internet search engines that negatively affect the profitability of certain types of websites and as a result reduce demand for new domain name registrations and renewals revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result we must evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our subordinated convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on stock price bond price risk free interest rates volatility and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

  

during the second quarter of 2014 we completed the repatriation of 7409 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefits resulting from the 2013 worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the us as a result of the repatriation the repatriation utilized substantially all of the capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries that were legally distributable under applicable foreign statutes deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the repatriation because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a 

decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

earnings per share 

we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our subordinated convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share under this method only a positive conversion spread related to the subordinated convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the ifconverted method which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com  and net domain name registries we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered with the  com and  net registries we receive a fee from thirdparty registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with thirdparty registrars or their resellers and the thirdparty registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars we increased the annual fee for a  net domain name registration from 511 to 562 on july 1 2013 from 562 to 618 on february 1 2014 and from 618 to 679 on february 1 2015 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our net agreement with icann through june 30 2017 the annual fee for a com domain name registration is fixed at 785 for the duration of the current com registry agreement through november 30 2018 except that prices may be raised by up to 7 each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability each as defined in the  com registry agreement of the dns subject to approval of the doc we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for  com and  net registrations are in us dollars revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues 

  

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares domain names ending in com  and net  managed by our registry services business   



2014 compared to 2013 revenues increased by  450 million  primarily due to a 3 increase in the number of domain names ending in  com and  net  and increases in the net domain name registration fees in july 2013 and february 2014 

2013 compared to 2012 revenues increased by 915 million primarily due to an 808 million increase in revenues from the operation of the registries for the com and net tlds and a 107 million increase from other service revenues the increase in revenues from operation of the registries for the com and net tlds is primarily due to a 5 increase in the number of domain names ending in  com and  net  and increases in the com domain name registration fees in january 2012 and net domain name registration fees in january 2012 and july 2013 as per our agreements with icann 

the growth in the domain name base was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs however ongoing economic uncertainty the introduction of new gtlds and changing marketing strategies by certain registrars has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in 2014 and to a lesser extent in 2013 further according to published reports google periodically makes changes to its search algorithms which may decrease traffic to certain websites and payperclick advertising policies which may provide less compensation for certain types of websites this could make such websites less profitable and hinder domain name registration growth we believe these algorithm changes had a negative effect on the first time renewal rate for registrations in recent years 

we expect to see continued growth in the domain name base during 2015 as a result of further internet growth in addition we expect to see continued growth internationally in the domain name base resulting from greater broadband availability internet adoption and expanding ecommerce however we expect the rate of growth to be limited because of the same factors described above which limited growth in 2014 we expect revenues will continue to increase in fiscal 2015 albeit at a slower rate as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of continued growth in the aggregate number of active domain names ending in  com and  net and increases in the  net domain name registration fees in february 2014 and 2015 

we generate revenue in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” australia china india and other asia pacific countries “apac” and certain other countries including canada and latin american countries 

  

the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues for our registry services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region registering domain names in another region these factors are reflected in the higher revenue growth in emea in 2014 and 2013 lower revenue growth in apac during 2014 and declining revenue in apac during 2013 and in the other region during 2014 

we applied for 14 new gtlds including 12 idn gtlds which are transliterations of “ com ” or “ net ” in various languages we executed registry agreements to become the registry operator for 12 of these new gtlds including 11 idns as well as comsec the remaining idn application was for a transliteration of “ com ” in traditional chinese script which was a variant of a string we applied for in another idn application “ com ” in simplified chinese and has been withdrawn at the request of icann because icann had not yet developed a policy to address such variants we may continue with this application or a new one for the same string once icann develops and implements a policy to address variant strings the deadline to execute the registry agreement for our  verisign  application is july 29 2015 there is no certainty that we will enter into the registry agreement for  verisign  or ultimately operate any of these new gtlds 

icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1000 which could delay the activation of some approved new gtlds even though idn gtlds have been given priority other factors related to the application process could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds further there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be any more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the new gtlds including our new gtld strings may face additional universal acceptability and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn gtlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well 

similarly while we originally entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds and applicants for approximately 170 new gtlds currently continue to contract with us to provide backend registry services there is no guarantee that such applicants with which we have entered into agreements will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds or that such new gtlds will be successful due to some or all of the factors discussed above in connection with our new gtlds we also cannot guarantee that we will ultimately provide backend registry services for all of these new gtlds icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds requires the distribution of new gtlds only through registrars who have executed the 2013 raa if registrars do not execute the 2013 raa our ability to provide backend registry services would be reduced negatively impacting the sale of our backend registry services for new gtlds even if we are able to provide such services the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of the application process and our customers’ respective launch plans for the new gtlds in addition we may face risks regarding icann requirements for mitigating name collisions in the new gtlds which we operate or for which we provide backend registry services 

we cannot assess the impact if any the introduction of these new gtlds will have on our revenues and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors—we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows” of this form 10k 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  



2014 compared to 2013 cost of revenues increased slightly primarily due to increases in allocated overhead expenses and depreciation expenses allocated overhead expenses increased by 18 million primarily due to an increase in allocable indirect costs depreciation expenses increased by 15 million primarily due to an increase in hardware and equipment purchases to support our network infrastructure in recent years 

2013 compared to 2012 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in registry fees depreciation expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses registry fees increased by 92 million due to increased registry fees required to be paid under the renewed  com  registry agreement which became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012 depreciation expenses increased by 70 million primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in 2013 the acceleration of depreciation on an abandoned software project in 2013 and a change in the estimated useful lives of computer 

hardware and equipment assets from three years to four years in 2012 salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to an increase in bonus expenses as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses gtld application costs trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



2014 compared to 2013 sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and marketing expenses and stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses advertising and marketing expenses increased by 27 million primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses for product marketing initiatives promoting registry and nia services and an increase in general corporate marketing expenses stockbased compensation expenses increased by 18 million primarily due to additional expense recognized for certain performancebased rsus which was recorded based on their periodend fair value as well as an increase in expense related to higher expected attainment levels for performancebased rsus granted in 2013 and 2014 and lower expense recognized during 2013 as a result of lower actual attainment level for performancebased rsus granted in 2012 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 20 million primarily due to a decrease in strategy consulting costs related to new gtlds and other marketing research expenses 

2013 compared to 2012 sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in advertising and consulting services expenses fees paid to icann for new gtld applications and allocated overhead expenses advertising and consulting services expenses decreased by 25 million due to changes in product marketing programs and the timing of marketing initiatives in our registry services business during 2012 we applied for 14 new gtlds and incurred fees of 26 million related to those applications allocated overhead expenses decreased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount relative to other functions and a decrease in allocable expenses 

  

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



2014 compared to 2013 research and development expenses decreased primarily due to a 17 million decrease in contract and professional services expenses from lower consulting costs on various development projects as we have shifted more development work to our employees 

2013 compared to 2012 research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses and a decrease in capitalized labor partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses increased by 85 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our dns infrastructure and new services and higher bonus expenses as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses capitalized labor 

decreased by 20 million in 2013 due to a decrease in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects contract and professional services expenses decreased by 34 million due to lower consulting costs on various projects 

  

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

2014 compared to 2013 general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefit expenses stockbased compensation expenses contract and professional services expenses and depreciation expenses partially offset by an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types and a decrease in legal expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 38 million primarily due to higher average headcount and increase in severance expenses stockbased compensation expenses increased by 55 million due to additional expense recognized for certain performancebased rsus which were recorded based on their periodend fair value as well as an increase in expense related to higher expected attainment levels for performancebased rsus granted in 2013 and 2014 and lower expense recognized during 2013 as a result of lower actual attainment level for performancebased rsus granted in 2012 contract and professional services expenses increased by 20 million primarily due to increases in strategic consulting costs depreciation expenses increased by 15 million primarily due to the additional depreciation related to an internal use software product being placed into service in 2014 overhead expenses allocated to other cost types increased by 35 million due to an increase in total allocable indirect costs legal expenses decreased by 27 million primarily due to a reduction in legal services related to income tax matters and our patent portfolio 

2013 compared to 2012 general and administrative expenses remained consistent in 2013 compared to 2012 as an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation in 2013 and the 2012 reimbursement of previously incurred legal costs received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business were offset by decreases in legal expenses occupancy expenses and contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 75 million including a 16 million increase in stockbased compensation expenses primarily due to an increase in average headcount and higher bonus expenses as compared to 2012 as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses stockbased compensation expenses increased due to higher expected attainment levels for performance based rsus granted to the company’s executives in 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized a credit of 45 million related to reimbursement of previously incurred legal costs received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business legal expenses decreased by 83 million due to costs incurred in 2012 to support the doc’s review of our renewal of the com registry agreement with icann in addition to decreases in patent and trademark related expenses and legal advice related to icann’s new gtld program occupancy expenses decreased by 26 million primarily due to the reversal of certain accrued expenses upon the resolution of a dispute related to a vacated office lease and a decrease in leased space contract and professional services expenses decreased by 17 million due to an increase in costs capitalized related to development and implementation of internal use software 

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014 

interest expense

nonoperating income net 

see note 11 “nonoperating income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

income tax benefit expense 

our effective tax rate for 2014 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by state income taxes and net income tax expense of 98 million due to a nonus income tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to a reorganization of certain international operations and changes in estimates during 2014 for us income taxes related to the 2013 worthless stock deduction and the 2014 repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we liquidated for tax purposes one of our domestic subsidiaries which allowed us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return we recorded an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 of 3753 million  related to the worthless stock deduction net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions the financial statement carrying value of this subsidiary was not material the worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the irs which could result in reversal of all part or none of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount recorded if the irs rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction we may have to pay additional cash income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive if any will be during the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an income tax expense of 1671 million related to taxable income generated in the us as a result of the 2014 repatriation for funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the us our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the us and accordingly we have not provided deferred us taxes see note 12 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

our effective tax rate for 2013 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from the worthless stock deduction net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions and tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by the expense related to the repatriation of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and state income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2012 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates and a decrease in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible stock based compensation 

as of december 31 2014 we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 3043 million  net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards decreased in 2014 as the net operating loss carryforwards were utilized to offset 2014 taxable income including the repatriation of foreign earnings 

we qualified for two tax holidays in switzerland the tax holidays provide reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of foreign source income one of the tax holidays is effective through december 31 2016 and upon expiration may be subject to renewal if certain criteria are satisfied the other tax holiday in switzerland expired on december 31 2014 and has not been extended these two tax holidays increased our earnings per share by  050   018  and  011  in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we qualify for an additional tax holiday in switzerland which will take effect beginning in 2015 this tax holiday is indefinite unless the required thresholds are no longer met or there is a law change which eliminates the holiday in the fourth quarter of 2014 we incurred a charge of  145 million  in nonus income taxes as a result of a reorganization of certain international operations as a result of the tax holiday which becomes effective in 2015 and the reorganization we do not believe there will be a significant change to our international tax rate after the expiration of the tax holiday in switzerland

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2014  our principal source of liquidity was 1916 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 12 billion  of marketable securities the marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days as of december 31 2014 all of our marketable securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “cash cash equivalents and marketable securities” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

during the second quarter of 2014 we completed the repatriation of approximately 7409 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes of 281 million as of december 31 2014 the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 9390 million our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and accordingly we have not provided deferred us taxes for these funds in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the us and if us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds we utilized substantially all of the remaining net operating losses generated from the 2013 worthless stock deduction to offset current year taxable income including the taxable income recognized in the us as a result of the repatriation the repatriation generated foreign source income in the us which allows the company to claim eligible foreign taxes amounting to 1877 million paid in the current year and prior years as foreign tax credits instead of as deductions the majority of these foreign tax credits will expire in 2024 see “risk factors  changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our effective tax rates” as of december 31 2014 the amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred income taxes have not been provided was 4470 million  

in 2014 proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases were 1516 million compared with 590 million in 2013 in 2012 purchases of marketable securities were 14 billion net of sales and maturities 

in 2014 we repurchased 163 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 5315 for an aggregate cost of 8671 million in 2013 we repurchased 210 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 4865 for an aggregate cost of 10 billion in 2012 we repurchased 77 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 4090 for an aggregate cost of 3146 million as of december 31 2014  there was 6235 million remaining for future share repurchases under the share buyback program effective january 30 2015 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of approximately 4529 million of our common stock in addition to the 5471 million of our common stock remaining available for repurchase under the previous share repurchase program for a total repurchase authorization of up to 10 billion of our common stock 

as of december 31 2014  we had 125 billion principal amount outstanding of 325 subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 see note 6 “debt and interest expense” of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2014 accordingly the subordinated convertible debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through march 31 2015 we do not expect a material amount of the subordinated convertible debentures to be converted in the near term as the trading price of the debentures exceeds the value that is likely to be received upon conversion however we cannot provide any assurance that the trading price of the debentures will continue to exceed the value that would be derived upon conversion or that the holders will not elect to convert the subordinated convertible debentures 

if a holder elects to convert its subordinated convertible debentures we are permitted under the indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the conversion value as defined in the indenture in cash stock or a combination thereof if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of conversion we currently have the intent and the ability based on current facts and circumstances to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash however if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures that holders actually elect to convert exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional 

sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert 

on august 14 2014 the upside trigger on the subordinated convertible debentures was met for the six month interest period from august 15 2014 through february 14 2015 on february 15 2015 we will pay contingent interest of 52 million in addition to the normal coupon interest to holders of record of the subordinated convertible debentures as of february 1 2015 the upside trigger is met if the subordinated convertible debentures’ average trading price is at least 150 of par during the 10 trading days before each semiannual interest period the upside trigger is tested semiannually for the following six months the semiannual upside contingent interest payment for a given period can be approximated by applying the annual rate of 05 to the aggregate market value of all outstanding subordinated convertible debentures and dividing by two for that semiannual period payment amount 

on april 16 2013 we issued 7500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2023 in a private offering the senior notes will mature in may 2023 we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the 1000 million of outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility the remaining portion of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of shares under the share buyback program the unsecured credit facility remains available with a borrowing capacity of 2000 million 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows 

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

2014 compared to 2013  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and cash paid to employees and vendors cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations during 2014 cash paid for interest increased due to the issuance of the senior notes in april 2013 payments to employees and vendors increased primarily due to an increase in operating expenses 

2013 compared to 2012  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and decreases in cash paid to employees and vendors offset by increases in interest paid and income taxes paid cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations during 2013 payments to employees and vendors decreased primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors interest paid increased in 2013 as a result of the issuance of our senior notes in april 2013 income taxes paid increased primarily due to federal income tax payments made during 2013 based on estimated taxable income before we determined that we would claim a worthless stock deduction that ultimately resulted in a tax loss for the year 

net cash provided by used in by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment 

  

2014 compared to 2013 the change in cash provided by used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities net of purchases of marketable securities and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment 

  

2013 compared to 2012 cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to 14 billion of purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities during 2012 compared to 585 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases in 2013 partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from and repayment of borrowings stock option exercises our employee stock purchase plan “espp” and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

  

2014 compared to 2013 net cash used in financing activities increased due to the proceeds received in 2013 from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercises and espp as well as lower recognized excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases and the repayment of borrowings under our credit facility in 2013 

2013 compared to 2012 net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchases during 2013 and repayment of the outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility in 2013 partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in 2013 

impact of inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented 

  

income taxes 

we derive significant tax savings from the subordinated convertible debentures during 2014 and 2013 the interest deduction for income tax purposes related to our subordinated convertible debentures was 1549 million and 1458 million respectively compared to coupon interest expense of 406 million for each of the same periods for income tax purposes we deduct interest expense on the subordinated convertible debentures calculated at 85 of the adjusted issue price subject to adjustment for actual versus projected contingent interest the adjusted issue price and consequently the interest deduction for income tax purposes grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken using a comparable yield of 85 on the adjusted issue price and the coupon rate of 325 on the principal amount compounded annually the interest deduction taken is subject to recapture upon settlement to the extent that the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the subordinated convertible debentures is less than the adjusted issue price interest recognized in accordance with gaap which is calculated at 839 of the liability component of the subordinated convertible debentures will also grow over the term but at a slower rate this difference will result in a continuing increase in the deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the subordinated convertible debentures ie the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date depending on the settlement amount for the subordinated convertible debentures at the settlement date the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial which could adversely impact our cash flow 

we do not expect to pay us federal income taxes during 2015 as a result of the interest deduction on our subordinated convertible debentures and the use of foreign tax credits and research tax credits we expect the amount of cash paid for nonus income taxes in 2015 to be consistent with 2014 

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2015 are anticipated to be between 400 million and 500 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 13 “commitments and contingencies ” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k   

we enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers in the ordinary course of business we also entered into indemnification agreements with symantec in connection with the sale of the authentication services business see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” indemnifications  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2014 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

dilution from subordinated convertible debentures rsus and stock options 

the conversion of our subordinated convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the subordinated convertible debentures we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount “the conversion spread” may be settled in shares of common stock as of december 31 2014 there are 364 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the subordinated convertible debentures based on the ifconverted value of the subordinated convertible debentures as of december 31 2014 the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to 144 million shares of common stock see item 1a “risk factors—we may not have the ability to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures occurrence of certain events related to our subordinated convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting disclosure tax and liquidity implications” of this form 10k 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2014 there are a total of 22 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of 18 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled there were no stock options granted in the last three years in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and rsu programs however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

our marketable securities consist of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2014 we had 12 billion  of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2014 we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 297 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

    

market risk management 

  

the fair market values of our subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the subordinated convertible debentures are subject to market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures the fair market value will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes but do not impact our financial condition cash flows or results of operations as of december 31 2014 the fair value of the subordinated convertible debentures was approximately 22 billion  and the fair value of the senior notes was 7276 million  based on available market information from public data sources 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on subordinated convertible debentures is also subject to market risk and to a lesser extent to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will increase or decrease with the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures

registry services 

  

registry services operates the authoritative directory of all com net cc tv and  name  domain names and the backend systems for all  gov  jobs  and edu domain names registry services allows individuals and organizations to establish their online identities while providing the secure alwayson access they need to communicate and transact reliably with largescale online audiences 

  

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net  and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com  agreement the us department of commerce “doc” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names in these tlds eg johndoecom and janedoenet our global constellation of domain name servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the tv  and cc  country code toplevel domains “cctlds” and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs  and edu gtlds these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system 

  

with our existing gtlds and cctlds we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language currently idns may be registered in as many as 350 different native languages and scripts 

  

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years and the fees charged for com and net may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term with respect to  com price increases require prior approval by the doc according to the terms of amendment 32 of the cooperative agreement between the doc and verisign revenues for registrations of name  are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those applicable to com  and  net    however name fees charged are subject to our agreement with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc  and tv  domain names are based on a similar fee system and registration system though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration “gsa” the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the registry operator of jobs no fees are received from operating the edu  registry infrastructure 

historically we have experienced higher domain name growth in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance the effect of this seasonality has historically resulted in the largest amount of growth in our deferred revenue balance occurring during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters

as part of our operations infrastructure for our registry services business we operate all authoritative domain name servers that answer domain name lookups for the com  and net  zones as well as for the other tlds for which we are the registry we also operate two of the 13 externally visible root zone server addresses which are considered to be the authoritative root zone servers of the internet’s dns our domain name servers provide the associated authoritative name servers and ip addresses for every com  and net  domain name on the internet and a large number of other tld queries resulting in an average of over 80 billion transactions per day these name servers are located around the world and provide local domain name service globally each server facility is a controlled and monitored environment incorporating security and system maintenance features this network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the internet’s dns infrastructure 

in 2012 and 2013 we continued to expand our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to accommodate projected internet attack trends in 2011 we deployed dnssec in the com  domain to protect the integrity of domain name system data 

  

call centers and help desk we provide customer support services through our phonebased call centers email help desks and webbased selfhelp systems our virginia call center is staffed 24 hours a day every day of the year to support our businesses all call centers have a staff of trained customer support agents and also provide webbased support services utilizing customized automatic response systems to provide selfhelp recommendations

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we seek to expand our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target  com  and  net  zone growth particularly in emerging international markets and by extending our brand and serving new markets through the idns for which we have applied we market our nia services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including direct sales and indirect channels we have marketing and sales offices throughout the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms navigation and resolution services data services value added services and nia services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2013 2012 and 2011 our research and development expenses were 703 million 617 million and 533 million respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline in conjunction we also continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use we expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers other vendors customers and the technology community under certain circumstances we may also acquire or license technology from third parties 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in each of the registry services and nia services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

competition in registry services   we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence in addition to the three gtlds we operate  com   net  and  name  and the 18 other operational gtlds delegated before october 23 2013 there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and 38 idn cctld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling methods of distribution the introduction of 

new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements with icann which result in registrars or their resellers giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds which have started to be introduced into the dns root zone additionally on june 13 2012 icann announced it received 1930 applications to operate over 1400 unique new gtlds icann has begun executing registry agreements with these new gtld applicants in connection with this initial round of gtld applications and intends to continue recommending up to 1400 new gtlds for delegation into the root zone on october 23 2013 the doc began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds icann plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain as set forth in the verisign labs technical report 1130007 version 22 new gtld security and stability considerations released on march 28 2013 we continue to believe there are issues regarding the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all we do not yet know the impact if any that these new gtlds may have on our business including if or how the introduction of these new gtlds will affect registrations for com  and net  and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

applicants for new gtlds include companies which may have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do including companies that are existing competitors domain name registrars and new entrants into the domain name industry furthermore icann will allow the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise affiliated with a registrar whereas we are currently prohibited by our agreements with icann and the doc from owning more than 15 of a registrar as a result operators of new gtlds may be able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration that verisign is currently prohibited from realizing icann has also approved a process pursuant to which an operator of an existing gtld could apply to become a registrar with respect to a new gtld at least one gtld operator has successfully used this process however it is uncertain whether we would seek or whether icann andor the doc would approve the necessary changes to our existing agreements to allow us to vertically integrate with respect to new gtlds without such changes we may be at a competitive disadvantage 

we have applied for 14 new gtlds including 12 idn gtlds although we have been invited by icann to begin the contracting process for 12 of our 14 new gtld applications there is no certainty that we will ultimately obtain these gtlds icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1000 which could delay the activation of some approved new gtlds even though idn gtlds have been given priority other factors related to the application process could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be any more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the gtlds we have applied for face additional universal acceptability and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn tlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well 

similarly while we originally entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds and applicants for approximately 200 new gtlds currently continue to contract with us to provide backend registry services there is no guarantee that such applicants with which we have entered into agreements will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds or that such new gtlds will be successful due to the same factors discussed above in connection with our gtld applications we also cannot guarantee that we will ultimately provide backend registry services for such amount of new gtlds icanns registry agreement for new gtlds requires the distribution of new gtlds only through registrars who have executed the new registry accreditation agreement “raa” if registrars do not execute the new raa our ability to provide backend services would be reduced negatively impacting the sale of our backend services for new gtlds even if we are able to provide such services the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of the application process and our customers’ respective launch plans for the new gtlds in addition our agreements to provide backend registry services directly to other applicants and indirectly through reseller relationships expose us to operational and other risks for example the increase in the number of gtlds for which we provide registry services on a standalone basis or as a backend service provider could further increase costs or increase the frequency or scope of targeted attacks from nefarious actors 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias 

limited ari registry services donuts inc and rightside inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google microsoft and yahoo operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

competition in nia services several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully in addition it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites 

we face competition in the network intelligence and availability services industry from companies or services such as isight partners ibm xforce secunia aps dell secureworks mcafee inc prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc neustar inc opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc afilias limited and akamai technologies inc

some of the services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable us export law as the list of products and countries requiring export approval expands or changes government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals or we violate applicable laws we may not be able to provide some of our services in international markets and may be subject to fines and other penalties 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the us and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property we continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for the verisign mark and new verisign logo in the us and certain countries and have pending trademark applications for the new verisign logo in a number of other countries we have common law rights in other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services 

  

with regard to our naming services businesses our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our naming services businesses and certain methodologies many of which are patented or for which patent applications are pending and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses we own our proprietary shared registration system through which registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on open standards set by organizations such as the internet engineering task force “ietf” to the extent any of our patents are considered “standard essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents 

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business which closed on august 9 2010 the “closing date” symantec acquired all trademarks primarily used in our authentication services business including our checkmark logo and the geotrust and thawte brand names and we granted symantec a fiveyear license in connection with the verisigncom website the verisigncom website will be operated by symantec for a period of five years following the closing date subject to certain rights of verisign including the right to include links to subdomains operated by us 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function 



we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following   

 our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenses which are expensed in full when incurred 

any or all of the above factors could impact our revenues and operating results therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

our operating results may continue to be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

an unstable global economic social and political environment may have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations including the ongoing hostilities in the middle east natural disasters the eurozone crisis currency fluctuations potential fallout from the disclosures related to the us internet and communications surveillance and the uncertainties of the us economic environment for example recently the ongoing challenging economic conditions in europe have possibly limited the rate of growth of the domain name base and may continue to do so in the future more generally the economic social and political environment has or may negatively impact among other things 

  

 in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may further negatively impact our business if the market economic social and political conditions in the us and globally do not improve or if they further deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

the operation of our business depends on numerous factors   

the successful operation of our business depends on numerous factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

 12 

substantially all of our revenue is derived from our registry services business limitations on our ability to raise prices on com  registrations and any failure to renew key agreements could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our registry services business which derives most of its revenues from registration fees for domain names generates substantially all of our revenue if there is a disruption in the registry services business including any disruption from changes in the domain name industry changes in or challenges to our agreements with icann including any changes resulting from legal challenges to these agreements changes in our customers’ or internet users’ preferences a downturn in the economy or changes in technology related to the use of domain names there may be a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition a failure of the doc to approve the renewal of the com  registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2018 could have a material adverse effect on our business 

under the terms of the cooperative agreement the company has the right to petition for potential relief from the  com  registry agreement’s pricing restrictions however there is uncertainty whether the doc will approve any exercise by the company of its right to increase the price per com  domain name under certain circumstances and whether the company will be able to successfully demonstrate to the doc that market conditions warrant removal of the pricing restrictions on com  domain names each of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations there is also uncertainty of future revenue and profitability and potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to the potential increase in expenses and costs coupled with such factors as restrictions on increasing prices under the com  registry agreement and the cooperative agreement or any other changes to pricing terms in these agreements upon renewal 

issues arising from our agreements with icann the doc and the gsa could harm our registry services business 

we are parties to agreements i with the doc with respect to certain aspects of the dns ii with icann and the doc as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com gtld and iii with icann with respect to being the exclusive registry for the net and name gtlds 

we face risks arising from our agreements with icann and the doc including the following   

 in addition under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar historically all gtld registry operators were subject to this vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby these registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal in some instances additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities furthermore unless prohibited by icann as noted above such vertical integration restrictions do not generally apply to cctld operators 

the impact of these changes to the distribution channel is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business if operators of new or existing gtlds are able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration if verisign were to seek removal of the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements with respect to existing gtlds or in the future with respect to new gtlds it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc approval would be obtained 

  

challenges to internet administration or changes to our pricing terms could harm our registry services business 

risks we face from challenges by third parties including governmental authorities in the us and other countries to our role in the ongoing operation of the internet include   

 as a result of these and other risks it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our registry services business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted which may not also apply to our competitors 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business   

as of december 31 2013 we had 133 or 12 of our employees outside the us doing business in international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business in some international locations or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others   

 14 

cash currently held by us outside the us see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources” 

 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling especially as we consider providing nia services and registry services to this sector counterfeit goods and cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have contracts pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and even though these contracts are immaterial they impose compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation which could be significant to the company 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

  

we operate two root zone servers and are contracted to perform the root zone maintainer function under icann’s new gtld program we face increased risk from these operations 

we administer and operate two of the 13 root zone servers root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and dns configuration data necessary to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet under the cooperative agreement we also function as the root zone maintainer in this role we provision and publish the authoritative data for the root zone itself and periodically distribute it to all root zone server operators 

under its new gtld program icann intends to recommend for delegation into the root zone up to 1400 new tlds potentially within a compressed timeframe on october 23 2013 the doc began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds in view of our role as the root zone maintainer and as a root operator we face increased risks should icann’s delegation of these new tlds cause security and stability problems within the dns andor for parties who rely on the dns such risks include potential instability of the dns including potential fragmentation of the dns should icann’s delegations create sufficient instability and potential claims based on our role in the root zone provisioning and delegation process these risks alone or in the aggregate have the potential to cause serious harm to our registry services business further our business could also be harmed through security stability and resiliency degradation if the delegation of new tlds into the root zone causes problems to certain components of the dns ecosystem or the third parties routing internet communications present inconsistent data for these new tlds or other aspects of the global dns or other relying parties are negatively impacted as a result of unaddressed domain name collisions 

changes in internet user behavior either as a result of evolving technologies or user practices may impact the demand for domain names 

currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet search engines were to change the value of their algorithms on the use of a domain for finding a website iii internet users’ preferences or practices were to shift away from direct navigation iv internet users were to significantly increase the use of web and mobile device applications to locate and access content or v internet users were to increasingly use third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names could decrease 

changes in the level of spending on online advertising andor the way that online networks compensate owners of websites could impact the demand for domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google yahoo and bing have and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past changed and may change in the future its search algorithm which may decrease site traffic to certain websites and payperclick advertising policies to provide less compensation for certain types of websites this has made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

changes in federal or state tax laws and regulations may discourage the registration or renewal of domain names for ecommerce 

many internet merchants are not currently required to collect sales taxes in respect of shipments of goods into states where they lack physical presence however state tax laws and regulations may change in the future and one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on outofstate companies that engage in online commerce for example several states most recently the state of minnesota have enacted “affiliate nexus” laws which require online retailers without a physical presence in the state to begin collecting sales taxes if a significant number of local sales are generated by brick and mortar affiliates operating in the state in addition it is possible that national legislation may be enacted requiring online retailers with greater than 1 million in sales in a state but without any physical presence in the state to begin collecting sales taxes this federal legislation the marketplace fairness act of 2013 s 743 passed the senate in 2013 and is currently before the house judiciary committee the enactment of any such state or federal laws may impair the growth of ecommerce and discourage the registration or renewal of domain names for ecommerce 

reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes among registrars or their resellers as a result of consolidation or changes in ownership management or strategy could harm our registry services business 

registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names our registry services business which generates substantially all of our revenue derives most of its revenues from registrations and renewals of domain names and decreased demand for andor renewals of domain names could cause a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as more broadly on internet users and consumers and thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from   

 most of the computing infrastructure for our shared registration system is located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to our primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for such interruptions or for potential losses arising from terrorism 

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control 

a failure in the operation of our tld name servers the domain name root zone servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services recommended by us in conformance with industry best practices the failure could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period a failure in the operation or update of the root master database that we maintain could also result in the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those tlds for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server any of these problems or outages could create potential liability and could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

in addition a failure in our nia services could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business could suffer 

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we retain certain customer and employee information in our secure data centers and various domain name registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the company as an operator of critical infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated forms of attacks such as advanced persistent threat “apt” attacks and zerohour threats which means that the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to 

defend against the shared registration system the domain name root zone servers and tld name servers that we operate are critical hardware and software to our registry services operations we expend significant time and money on the security of our facilities and infrastructure despite our security measures we have been subject to a security breach as first disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins outages resulting from destructive malcode computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for certain of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

we are frequently subject to largescale ddos attacks 

our networks have been and likely will continue to be subject to ddos attacks of increasing size and sophistication we have adopted mitigation techniques procedures and strategies to defend against such attacks but there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication any successful attack or partially successful attack could disrupt our networks increase response time and generally hamper our ability to provide reliable service to our registry services customers and the broader internet community further we sell ddos protection services to nia services customers although our contracts with these customers provide that we may prioritize all or part of these services at no liability to us in order to preserve our operational stability the provision of such services might expose us to very largescale ddos attacks against those customers in addition to any directed specifically against us and our networks 

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or enforce or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our applications and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the internet engineering task force to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our registry services business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to fully register build equity in or enforce the new logo for verisign in all markets where verisign products and services are sold 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

we cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties the international use of our logo could present additional potential risks for third party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

a third party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits and investigations such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in lawsuits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such investigations claims and lawsuits could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” legal proceedings of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we must establish and maintain strategic channel and other relationships 

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts including in international markets we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our services than we would otherwise 

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

furthermore any changes by our distributors to their existing marketing strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if one or more of our distributors were to encounter financial difficulties or if there were a significant reduction in marketing expenditures by our distributors including registrars or their resellers as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on our business including a decrease in domain name registrations and renewals failure of one or more of our strategic channel or other relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars based upon their registrant needs may choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings andor reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their ecommerce platforms and if we are unable to maintain their focus on our products and services or move through them to engage the same registrants this could harm our business 

  

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exploring a variety of possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings or initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all any strategic initiative to leverage our patent portfolio will likely increase litigation risks from potential licensees and we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently unpredictable and regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources 

the success of our nia services depends in part on the acceptance of our services 

we are investing in our nia services and the future growth of these services depends in part on the commercial success acceptance and reliability of our nia services we continually evaluate and evolve the terms and conditions upon which these services are sold these services may not experience success or acceptance as a result of changes to the terms and conditions also these services will suffer if our target customers do not adopt or use these services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our nia services or continue to use these services even after adoption 

we rely on third parties to provide products which are incorporated in our nia services 

the nia services incorporate and rely on third party hardware and software products many of which have unique capabilities if verisign is unable to procure these third party products the nia services may malfunction not perform as well as they should perform not perform as well as they have been performing or not perform as planned and our business could suffer 

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

our registry services and nia services businesses are developing services in emerging markets including services that involve naming and directory services other than registry and related infrastructure services these emerging markets are rapidly evolving may never gain wide acceptance and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services in these markets include the following   

 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees and we have experienced changes in our management team during the last few years if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer 

we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include   

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities in accordance with us gaap we recognize income tax benefits net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our swiss subsidiaries our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates 

as described further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we expect to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return and have recorded during the fourth quarter of 2013 an income tax benefit of 3753 million  net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions recorded as required under us gaap this worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the irs which could result in the reversal of all part or none of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount recorded if the irs rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction we may have to pay additional cash income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive if any will be 

various legislative proposals that would reform us corporate tax laws have been proposed by the obama administration as well as members of congress including proposals that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we are unable to predict whether these or other proposals will be implemented although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense or cash flow 

our inability to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as described further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k during the second or third quarter of 2014 we intend to repatriate approximately 7000 million to 8000 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefits resulting from the worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the us as a result of the intended repatriation the repatriation amount utilizes substantially all of the projected available distributable capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries under applicable foreign statutes deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the intended repatriation because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 

we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if these factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are exposed to risks faced by financial institutions 

the hedging transactions we have entered into expose us to credit risk in the event of default by one of our counterparties despite the risk control measures we have in place a default by one of our counterparties or liquidity problems in the financial services industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results   

as of december 31 2013 we had 17 billion in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 14 billion was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the us debt ceiling crisis and the eurozone crisis which affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues during the 2008 financial crisis the volatility and disruption in the global credit market reached unprecedented levels if the global credit market deteriorates again or other events negatively impact the market for us treasury securities our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results results of operations and cash flows 

we may be exposed to potential risks if we do not have an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require us to report on and receive an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting despite our efforts if we were to fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results or adequately identify and reduce fraud as a result our financial condition could be harmed and current and potential future security holders could lose confidence in us andor our reported financial results which may cause a negative effect on our stock price and we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings which may be costly or divert management attention 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in dulles virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including   

 risks relating to the competitive environment in which we operate 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

general new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

competition in registry services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence in addition to the three gtlds we operate  com   net  and  name  and the 18 other operational gtlds delegated before october 23 2013 there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and 38 idn cctld registries under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements with icann which result in registrars or their resellers giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

in addition on october 23 2013 the doc began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds icann is executing registry agreements with new gtld applicants awarding up to 1400 new gtlds in an initial round under its new gtld program and plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain for additional information about the potential risks presented by these new gtlds see “we may face additional competition operational and other other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows” 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited ari registry services donuts inc and rightside inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google microsoft and yahoo operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

competition in nia services  several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully in addition it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites 

we face competition in the network intelligence and availability services industry from companies or services such as isight partners ibm xforce secunia aps dell secureworks mcafee inc prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc neustar inc opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc afilias limited and akamai technologies inc 

we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds which have started to be introduced into the dns root zone additionally on june 13 2012 icann announced it received 1930 applications to operate over 1400 unique new gtlds icann has begun executing registry agreements with these new gtld applicants in connection with this initial round of gtld applications and intends to continue recommending up to 1400 new gtlds for delegation into the root zone on october 23 2013 the doc began to authorize and verisign began effectuating the delegation of the new gtlds icann plans on offering a second round of new gtlds after the completion of the initial round the timing of which is uncertain as set forth in the verisign labs technical report 1130007 version 22 new gtld security and stability considerations released on march 28 2013 we continue to believe there are issues regarding the deployment of the new gtlds that should have been addressed before any new gtlds were delegated and despite our efforts some of these issues have not been addressed by icann sufficiently if at all we do not yet know the impact if any that these new gtlds may have on our business including if or how the introduction of these new gtlds will affect registrations for com  and net  and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

applicants for new gtlds include companies which may have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do including companies that are existing competitors domain name registrars and new entrants into the domain name industry in addition under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements with icann as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are not permitted to acquire directly or indirectly control of or a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icannaccredited registrar historically all gtld registry operators were subject to this vertical integration prohibition however icann has established a process whereby these registry operators may seek icann’s approval to remove this restriction and icann has approved such removal in some instances additionally icann’s registry agreement for new gtlds generally permits such vertical integration with certain limitations including icann’s right but not the obligation to refer such vertical integration activities to competition authorities furthermore unless prohibited by icann as noted above such vertical integration restrictions do not generally apply to cctld operators 

if verisign were to seek removal of the vertical integration restrictions contained in our agreements with respect to existing gtlds or in the future with respect to new gtlds it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc approval would be obtained without such changes we may be at a competitive disadvantage 

we have applied for 14 new gtlds including 12 idn gtlds although we have been invited by icann to begin the contracting process for 12 of our 14 new gtld applications there is no certainty that we will ultimately obtain these gtlds icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1000 which could delay the activation of some approved new gtlds even though idn gtlds have been given priority other factors related to the application process could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be any more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the gtlds we have applied for face additional universal acceptability and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn tlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well 

similarly while we originally entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds and applicants for approximately 200 new gtlds currently continue to contract with us to provide backend registry services there is no guarantee that such applicants with which we have entered into agreements will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds or that such new gtlds will be successful due to the same factors discussed above in connection with out gtld application we also cannot guarantee that we will ultimately provide backend registry services for such amount of new gtlds icanns registry agreement for new gtlds requires the distribution of new gtlds only through registrars who have executed the new raa if registrars do not execute the new raa our ability to provide backend services would be reduced negatively impacting the sale of our backend services for new gtlds even if we are able to provide such services the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of the application process and our customers’ respective launch plans for the new gtlds 

  

in addition our agreements to provide backend registry services directly to other applicants and indirectly through reseller relationships expose us to operational and other risks for example the increase in the number of gtlds for which we provide registry services on a standalone basis or as a backend service provider could further increase costs or increase the frequency or scope of targeted attacks from nefarious actors 

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market share we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or launch entirely new products and services in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or anticipate or respond successfully or in a cost effective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

risks related to the sale of our authentication services business and the completion of our divestitures 

we face risks related to the terms of the sale of the authentication services business 

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business the “symantec agreement” we agreed to several terms that may pose risks to us including the potential for confusion by the public with respect to symantec’s right to use certain of our trademarks brands and domain names as well as the risk that current or potential investors in or customers of the company may incorrectly attribute to the company problems with symantec products or services that currently use the verisign brand pursuant to a license granted by the company to symantec any such confusion may have a negative impact on our reputation our brand and the market for our products and services in addition we may determine that certain assets transferred to symantec could have been useful in our naming services businesses or in other future endeavors requiring us to forego future opportunities or design or purchase alternatives which could be costly and less effective than the transferred assets 

under the terms of the symantec agreement we have licensed rights to certain of our domain name registrations to symantec we are at risk that our customers will go to a url for a licensed domain name and be unable to locate our registry or nia services in addition we will continue to maintain the registration rights for the domain names licensed to symantec for which symantec has sole control over the displayed content and we may be subject to claims of infringement if symantec posts content that is alleged to infringe the rights of a third party 

we continue to be responsible for certain liabilities following the divestiture of certain businesses 

under the agreements reached with the buyers of certain divested businesses including the authentication services business we remain liable for certain liabilities related to the divested businesses there is a possibility that we will incur unanticipated costs and expenses associated with management of liabilities relating to the businesses we have divested including requests for indemnification by the buyers of the divested businesses these liabilities could potentially relate to i breaches of contractual representations and warranties we gave to the buyers of the divested businesses or ii certain liabilities relating to the divested businesses that we retained under the agreements reached with the buyers of the divested businesses such liabilities could include certain litigation matters including actions brought by third parties where responsibility for such liabilities is to be contractually allocated to the buyer or shared with the buyer or another party it is possible that the buyer or the other party may be in default for payments for which they are responsible obligating us to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of those obligations 

following the divestiture of the authentication services business our ability to compete with that business is restricted 

under the symantec agreement we are restricted from directly competing with the authentication services business for a defined period of time pursuant to a negotiated noncompete arrangement 

risks related to our securities 

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance    

as of december 31 2013 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1337 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 164 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding equity and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 the “subordinated convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

as a result of the sale of the subordinated convertible debentures and our senior notes due 2023 the “senior notes” we have a substantial amount of longterm debt outstanding in addition to the subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes we have an unsecured credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 2000 million the “unsecured credit facility” and the ability to request from time to time that the lenders thereunder agree on a discretionary basis to increase the aggregate commitments amount by up to 1500 million as of december 31 2013 we had no borrowings under the unsecured credit facility 

it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations and will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks and limitations related to our level of indebtedness could intensify specifically a high level of indebtedness could have adverse effects on our flexibility to take advantage of corporate opportunities including the following 

 

in addition the indenture that governs the senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our unsecured credit facility contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of our debt 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness including the senior notes and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control moreover in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to repay our debt obligations and us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

our unsecured credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries which are not guarantors of the senior notes or our other indebtedness repayment of our indebtedness is substantially dependent on the generation of cash flow by verisign inc our nonguarantor subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose future guarantor subsidiaries if any may not be able to or may not be permitted to on commercially reasonable terms or at all make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness such subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries on commercially reasonable terms or at all while our unsecured credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions if we cannot service our debt obligations with our cash flows and domestic cash on hand we may be required to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries which would be subject to us federal income tax or may otherwise be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of the senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our unsecured credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money certain holders of our subordinated convertible debentures could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions and create the risk of default on such indebtedness 

the credit agreement that governs our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including subject to certain exceptions restrictions on our ability to 

 27 

in addition the restrictive covenants in our unsecured credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under our unsecured credit facility or the indenture governing the senior notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under our unsecured credit facility would permit the lenders under our unsecured credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that agreement in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

some of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that appear on our consolidated balance sheet may not be available for use in our business or to meet our debt obligations without adverse income tax consequences    

as of december 31 2013 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the senior notes or our other indebtedness was 15 billion as described further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k during the second or third quarter of 2014 we intend to repatriate approximately 7000 million to 8000 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the intended repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the us our intent is to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the us 

in the event that funds from our foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states or to meet our debt obligations and if us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate those funds in light of the foregoing the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that appear on our balance sheet may overstate the amount of liquidity we have available to meet our business or debt obligations including obligations under the senior notes 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control 

upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events and if the senior notes are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies that rate the senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior notes at 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date additionally under our unsecured credit facility a change of control as defined therein constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the unsecured credit facility and the commitments to lend would terminate the source of funds for any repurchase of the senior notes and repayment of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources including borrowings sales of assets or sales of equity we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due if we fail to repurchase the senior notes in that circumstance we will be in default under the indenture that governs the senior notes we may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such repurchases and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all further our ability to repurchase the senior notes may be limited by law in order to avoid the obligation to repurchase the senior notes and events of default and potential breaches of our unsecured credit facility we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us 

in addition certain important corporate events such as leveraged recapitalizations may not under the indenture that governs the senior notes constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the senior notes even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure credit ratings or the value of the senior notes additionally holders may not be able to require us to purchase their senior notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of our board of directors including a proxy contest where our board of directors approves for purposes of the change of control provisions of the indenture but does not endorse a dissident slate of directors in this regard decisions of the delaware chancery court not involving us or our securities considered a change of control redemption provision contained in an indenture governing publicly traded debt securities that was substantially similar to the change of control redemption provision in the indenture that governs the senior notes with respect to “continuing directors” in these cases the court noted that the board of directors may “approve” a dissident shareholder’s nominees solely to avoid triggering the change of control redemption provision of the indenture without supporting their election if the board determines in good faith that the election of the dissident nominees would not be materially adverse to the interests of the corporation or its stockholders without taking into consideration the interests of the holders of debt securities in making this determination further according to these decisions the directors’ duty of loyalty to shareholders under delaware law may in certain circumstances require them to give such approval 

furthermore the exercise by the holders of senior notes of their right to require us to repurchase the senior notes pursuant to a change of control offer could cause a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness including future agreements even if the change of control itself does not due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us in the event a change of control offer is required to be made at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing senior notes we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibitions if we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings we will remain prohibited from purchasing senior notes in that case our failure to purchase tendered senior notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture which could in turn constitute a default under our other indebtedness finally our ability to pay cash to the holders of senior notes upon a repurchase pursuant to a change of control offer may be limited by our then existing financial resources 

a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital 

any rating assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our debt securities any lowering of our rating likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future 

we may not have the ability to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures occurrence of certain events related to our subordinated convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting disclosure tax and liquidity implications   

as a result of the sale of the subordinated convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding holders of our outstanding subordinated convertible debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the subordinated convertible debentures dated as of august 20 2007 between the company and us bank national association as trustee the “2007 indenture” although in certain situations the 2007 indenture requires us to pay this repurchase price in cash we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all 

the subordinated convertible debentures continue to be convertible due to our stock price exceeding the conversion price threshold trigger and if holders elect to convert their subordinated convertible debentures we are permitted under the 2007 indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the settlement amount as defined in the 2007 indenture in cash stock or a combination thereof if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of a conversion we currently have the intent and the ability based on current facts and circumstances to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash however if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures due to holders as a result of rights to convert or require repurchase exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert or require the company to repurchase 

if we do not have adequate cash available either from cash on hand funds generated from operations or existing financing arrangements or cannot obtain additional financing arrangements we will not be able to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash and in the case of settlement of conversion elections will be required to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in stock if we settle any portion of the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in stock it will result in immediate dilution to the interests of existing security holders and the dilution could be material to such security holders 

if our intent to settle the principal amount in cash changes or if we conclude that we no longer have the ability in the future we will be required to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the ifconverted method earnings per share will most likely be lower under the ifconverted method as compared to the treasury stock method 

if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the subordinated convertible debentures ie the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions the adjusted issue price grows over the term of the subordinated convertible debentures due to the difference between the interest deduction for tax using a comparable yield rate of 85 and the coupon rate of 325 compounded annually the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date depending on the settlement amount for the subordinated convertible debentures at the settlement date the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial which could adversely impact our cash flow 

a fundamental change may constitute an event of default or prepayment under or result in the acceleration of the maturity of our thenexisting indebtedness our ability to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash or make any other required payments may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time our failure to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures when required would result in an event of default with respect to the subordinated convertible debentures

overview 

we are a global provider of domain name registry services which power the navigation of the internet by operating a global infrastructure for a portfolio of tlds that includes com net tv edu gov jobs name and cc as well as two of the world’s 13 internet root servers “registry services” our product suite also includes nia services consisting of ddos protection services idefense and managed dns we have one reportable segment consisting of registry services and nia services as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 1272 million domain names registered under the com  and net  registries our principal registries the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars growth in the number of domain names has been hindered by certain factors including the overall economic conditions and ongoing changes to search algorithms used by google and other internet search engines that negatively affect the profitability of certain types of websites and as a result reduce demand for new domain name registrations and renewals revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues 

2013 business highlights and trends 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we liquidated for tax purposes one of our domestic subsidiaries which will allow us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return we recorded an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 of 3753 million  related to the worthless stock deduction net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions the financial statement carrying value of this subsidiary was not material the worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the irs which could result in reversal of all part or none of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount recorded if the irs rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction we may have to pay additional cash income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive if any will be 

we evaluated various scenarios for realizing the tax benefits from the worthless stock deduction and determined that using part of the benefit to offset current year domestic income combined with a repatriation of a portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries as the most financially beneficial alternative accordingly during the second or third quarter of 2014 we intend to repatriate approximately 7000 million to 8000 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefits resulting from the worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the us as a result of the repatriation the repatriation amount is intended to utilize substantially all of the projected available distributable capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries under applicable foreign statutes during the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an income tax expense of 1671 million  related to taxable income generated in the us as a result of the intended repatriation for funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the intended repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the us our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the us and accordingly we have not provided deferred us taxes 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result we must evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our subordinated convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on stock price bond price risk adjusted interest rates volatility and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

  

litigation and contingencies 

  

liabilities for loss contingencies are based on management’s judgment as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the potential amount of loss incurred a liability is recorded when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated these liabilities are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment if actual results differ from these estimates our results of operations could be materially affected in future periods when the contingencies are resolved 

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

  

during the second or third quarter of 2014 we intend to repatriate approximately 7000 million to 8000 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefits resulting from the worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the us as a result of the intended repatriation the repatriation amount utilizes substantially all of the projected available distributable capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries under applicable foreign statutes deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the intended repatriation because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

earnings per share 

we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our subordinated convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share under this method only a positive conversion spread related to the subordinated convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the ifconverted method which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com net cc   tv  name gov  and jobs domain name registries revenues from cc tv name gov  and jobs are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee from thirdparty registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with thirdparty registrars or their resellers and the thirdparty registrars in turn register the com net cc tv name and jobs domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars on january 15 2012 we increased our com domain name registration fees by 7 from 734 to 785  we also increased our net domain name registration fees from 465 to 511 on january 15 2012 from 511 to 562 on july 1 2013 and from 562 to 618 on february 1 2014 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our net agreement with icann through june 30 2017 the price of com domain names is fixed at 785 for the duration of the current com registry agreement through november 30 2018 except that prices may be raised by up to 7 each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability each as defined in the com registry agreement of the dns subject to approval of the doc we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all fees paid to us for com and net registrations are in us dollars revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues 

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares domain names ending in com  and net  managed by our registry services business   



our revenues increased by  915 million  in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to an 808 million increase in revenues from the operation of the registries for the  com  and  net tlds and a 107 million increase from other service revenues the increase in revenues from operation of the registries for the com and net tlds is primarily due to a 5 increase in the number of domain names ending in  com and  net  and increases in the com domain name registration fees in january 2012 and net domain name registration fees in january 2012 and july 2013 as per our agreements with icann our revenues increased by 1016 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to an 876 million increase in revenues from the operation of the registries for the com and net tlds and a 138 million increase from other service revenues the increase in revenues from operation of the registries for the com  and net  tlds is primarily due to a 6 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com  and net  and increases in our com and net  domain name registration fees in july 2010 and january 2012 as per our agreements with icann 

the growth in the number of active domain names during 2013 was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs however ongoing economic uncertainty has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base further according to published reports google has made changes to its search algorithms which may decrease traffic to certain websites and payperclick advertising policies which may provide less compensation for certain types of websites this could make such websites less profitable and hinder domain name registration growth we believe these algorithm changes had a negative effect on the first time renewal rate for registrations during 2013 and 2012 

we expect to see continued growth in the number of active domain names in 2014 as a result of further internet growth in addition we expect to see continued growth internationally in the domain name base resulting from greater broadband availability internet adoption and expanding ecommerce we believe certain registrars have made changes to their marketing strategies and are offering fewer discount programs for domain name registrations we believe these marketing changes by registrars along with economic conditions in certain emerging markets may limit growth in the number of active domain names during 2014 although growth in the domain name base may be limited by these factors we expect revenues will continue to increase in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as a result of continued growth in the number of active domain names ending in  com and  net and increases in the  com domain name registration fees in january 2012 and  net domain name registration fees in january 2012 and july 2013 

the company generates revenue in the us europe the middle east and africa “emea” australia china india and other asia pacific countries “apac” and certain other countries including canada and latin american countries 

  

the following table presents a comparison of the company’s geographic revenues 



revenues for our registry services business are generally attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which the company’s registrars are located however this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating or relocating or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers revenue growth in emea benefited from several such changes during 2013 while revenue in apac was negatively impacted 

we have applied for 14 new gtlds including 12 idn gtlds although we have been invited by icann to begin the contracting process for 12 of our 14 new gtld applications there is no certainty that we will ultimately obtain these gtlds icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1000 which could delay the activation of some approved new gtlds even though idn gtlds have been given priority other factors related to the application process could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds 

even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be any more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors for example some of the gtlds we have applied for face additional universal acceptability and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds even if demand for such products is strong this is particularly true for idn tlds but applies to conventional gtlds as well 

similarly while we originally entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds and applicants for approximately 200 new gtlds currently continue to contract with us to provide backend registry services there is no guarantee that such applicants with which we have entered into agreements will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds or that such new gtlds will be successful due to the same factors discussed above in connection with our gtld applications we also cannot guarantee that we will ultimately provide backend registry services for such amount of new gtlds icanns registry agreement for new gtlds requires the distribution of new gtlds only through registrars who have executed the new raa if registrars do not execute the new raa our ability to provide backend services would be reduced negatively impacting the sale of our backend services for new gtlds even if we are able to provide such services the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of the application process and our customers’ respective launch plans for the new gtlds we cannot assess the impact if any the introduction of these new gtlds will have on our revenues and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors—we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows” of this form 10k 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  



2013 compared to 2012 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in registry fees depreciation expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses registry fees increased by 92 million due to increased registry fees required to be paid under the renewed  com  registry agreement which became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012 depreciation expenses increased by 70 million primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in 2013 the acceleration of depreciation on an abandoned software project in 2013 and a change in the estimated useful lives of computer hardware and equipment assets from three years to four years in 2012 salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation increased by 42 million primarily due to an increase in bonus expenses as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses 

2012 compared to 2011 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in direct cost of revenues salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses direct cost of revenues increased by 28 million primarily due to increased registry fees required to be paid in the new  tv  and  com  registry agreements which became effective in 2012 and an increase in data hosting costs salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation increased by 19 million primarily due to an increase in the average headcount to support our registry services business and continued growth of our nia services business partially offset by a reduction in the estimated payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses and a decrease in stockbased compensation due to additional vested rsus granted to option holders during 2011 as they did not participate in the may 2011 and december 2010 special cash dividends depreciation expenses decreased by 34 million primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation on an abandoned software project in 2011 and a change in the estimated useful lives of computer hardware and equipment assets from three years to four years beginning in 2012 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2014 as compared to 2013 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses gtld application costs trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



2013 compared to 2012 sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in advertising and consulting services expenses fees paid to icann for new gtld applications and allocated overhead expenses advertising and consulting services expenses decreased by 25 million due to changes in product marketing programs and the timing of marketing initiatives in our registry services business during 2012 we applied for 14 new gtlds and incurred fees of 26 million related to those applications allocated overhead expenses decreased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount relative to other functions and a decrease in allocable expenses 

2012 compared to 2011 sales and marketing expenses remained consistent with an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses as well as fees paid to icann for new gtld applications offset by a decrease in consulting and advertising expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to an increase in the average headcount related to the expansion of the international marketing team for our registry services business and growth of our nia sales team partially offset by a decrease in the estimated payout for fiscal 2012 bonuses and stockbased compensation expenses due to additional vested rsus granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the december 2010 and may 2011 special cash dividends during 2012 we applied for 14 new gtlds and incurred fees of 26 million related to those applications consulting and advertising expenses decreased by 71 million primarily due to consulting costs related to the new gtld program and product marketing initiatives promoting registry services during 2011 

  

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2014 as compared to 2013 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



2013 compared to 2012 research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses and a decrease in capitalized labor partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses increased by 85 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our dns infrastructure and new services and higher bonus expenses as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses capitalized labor decreased by 20 million in 2013 due to a decrease in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects contract and professional services expenses decreased by 34 million due to lower consulting costs on various projects 

2012 compared to 2011 research and development expenses increased primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses and contract and professional services expenses partially offset by an increase in capitalized labor salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses increased by 66 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our dns infrastructure and new services partially offset by a decrease in the estimated payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses contract and professional services expenses increased by 30 million primarily to support projects in our nia services business capitalized labor increased by 21 million primarily due to an increase in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

2013 compared to 2012 general and administrative expenses remained consistent in 2013 compared to 2012 as an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation in 2013 and the 2012 reimbursement of previously incurred legal costs received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business were offset by decreases in legal expenses occupancy expenses and contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 75 million including a 16 million increase in stockbased compensation expenses primarily due to an increase in average headcount and higher bonus expenses as compared to 2012 as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses stockbased compensation expenses increased due to higher expected attainment levels for performance based rsus granted to the company’s executives in 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized a credit of 45 million related to reimbursement of previously incurred legal costs received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business legal expenses decreased by 83 million due to costs incurred in 2012 to support the doc’s review of our renewal of the com registry agreement with icann in addition to decreases in patent and trademark related expenses and legal advice related to icann’s new gtld program occupancy expenses decreased by 26 million primarily due to the reversal of certain accrued expenses upon the resolution of a dispute related to a vacated office lease and a decrease in leased space contract and professional services expenses decreased by 17 million due to an increase in costs capitalized related to development and implementation of internal use software 

2012 compared to 2011 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation contract and professional services expenses occupancy expenses receipts from the settlement of indemnification claims with the former shareholders of an acquired business and an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types partially offset by increases in depreciation expenses legal expenses and miscellaneous general and administrative expenses salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 156 million including a 44 million decrease in stockbased compensation primarily due to the reduced headcount in corporate support functions subsequent to the divestiture of the authentication services business and a reduction in estimated payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses stockbased compensation expenses also decreased due to additional vested rsus granted to option holders during 2011 as they did not participate in the may 2011 and december 2010 special cash dividends partially offset by 14 million of stockbased compensation expense for fully vested rsus granted to members of the board of directors during 2012 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 49 million primarily due to reductions in consulting services expenses and reductions in temporary staffing upon completion of the transition of certain corporate functions from california to virginia in 2011 occupancy expenses decreased by 63 million primarily due to lower rent expense as we exited leased facilities in mountain view california and dulles virginia and purchased our corporate headquarters facility in reston virginia during 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized a credit of 45 million related to reimbursements of previously incurred legal costs received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business overhead expenses allocated to other cost types increased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in the relative headcount of the general and administrative function compared to other functions subsequent to the completion of the 2010 restructuring plan and the transition of corporate functions from california to virginia depreciation expenses increased by 32 million primarily due to the additional depreciation related to our new corporate headquarters legal expenses increased by 52 million primarily due to an insurance recovery in 2011 related to a certain legal matter as well as legal and other support related to the doc’s review of the renewal of our  com  registry agreement with icann and legal advice related to icann’s new gtld program in 2012 miscellaneous expenses increased by 48 million primarily due to the release of 59 million of liabilities related to nonincome tax expenses as a result of the lapse of the statutes of limitations during 2011

restructuring charges 

see note 6 “restructuring charges” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

interest expense 

the following table presents the components of interest expense 



contractual interest on the senior notes during 2013 is the result of the issuance of the senior notes in april 2013 the indenture governing the subordinated convertible debentures requires the payment of contingent interest to the holders of the subordinated convertible debentures if the board declares a dividend to our stockholders that is designated by the board as an extraordinary dividend the contingent interest is calculated as the amount derived by multiplying the per share declared dividend with the ifconverted number of shares applicable to the subordinated convertible debentures the board declared an extraordinary dividend in april 2011 and consequently we paid 1000 million of contingent interest to holders of the subordinated convertible debentures in 2011 

 we expect interest expense as a percentage of revenues to increase in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of having a full year of interest expense related to the senior notes included in 2014 

nonoperating income net 

see note 12 “nonoperating income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

income tax benefit expense 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we liquidated for tax purposes one of our domestic subsidiaries which will allow us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return we recorded an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 of 3753 million  related to the worthless stock deduction net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions the financial statement carrying value of this subsidiary was not material the worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the irs which could result in reversal of all part or none of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount recorded if the irs rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction we may have to pay additional cash income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive if any will be 

we evaluated various scenarios for realizing the tax benefits from the worthless stock deduction and determined that using part of the benefit to offset current year domestic income combined with a repatriation of cash held by foreign subsidiaries as the most financially beneficial alternative accordingly during the second or third quarter of 2014 we intend to repatriate approximately 7000 million to 8000 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefits resulting from the worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the us as a result of the intended repatriation the repatriation amount is expected to utilize substantially all of the projected distributable capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries under applicable foreign statutes during the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an income tax expense of 1671 million  related to 

taxable income generated in the us as a result of the intended repatriation for funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the intended repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the us our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the us and accordingly we have not provided deferred us taxes see note 13 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

our effective tax rate for 2013 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to benefits from the worthless stock deduction net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions and tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by the expense related to the repatriation of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and state income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2012 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates and a decrease in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible stock based compensation 

our effective tax rate for 2011 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by an increase in the accrual for uncertain tax positions tax expense related to a foreign currency transaction gain realized on the distribution of previously taxed income state income taxes and nondeductible stock based compensation 

as of december 31 2013 we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 4247 million net of valuation allowances but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards book and tax basis differences of certain investments and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities together with future taxable income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards increased in 2013 primarily due to the worthless stock deduction 

we qualify for two tax holidays in switzerland the tax holidays provide reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of investment and employment one of the tax holidays is effective through december 31 2015 the other is effective through december 31 2014 upon expiration the tax holidays may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied these tax holidays increased the company’s earnings per share by  018  in 2013  011  in 2012 and  006  in 2011 

income from discontinued operations net of tax 

see note 4 “discontinued operations” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2013  our principal source of liquidity was 3392 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 14 billion  of marketable securities the marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the us treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days as of december 31 2013 all of our marketable securities have contractual maturities of less than one year our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “cash cash equivalents and marketable securities” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2013 the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 15 billion during the second or third quarter of 2014 we intend to repatriate approximately 7000 million to 8000 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefits resulting from the worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the us as a result of the repatriation the repatriation amount is expected to utilize substantially all of the projected available distributable capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries under applicable foreign statutes for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the us our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the us and accordingly we have not provided deferred us taxes for such funds in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the us and if us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds as of december 31 2013 the amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred income taxes have not been provided was 1533 million 

on april 16 2013 we issued 7500 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2023 in a private offering the senior notes will mature in may 2023 we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the 1000 million of outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility the remaining portion of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of shares under the 2013 share buyback program the unsecured credit facility remains available with a borrowing capacity of 2000 million 

in 2013 proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities were 590 million net of purchases compared with 14 billion of purchases in 2012 net of sales and maturities in 2011 proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities were 4670 million net of purchases 

in 2013 we repurchased 210 million  shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 4865 for an aggregate cost of 10 billion in 2012 we repurchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 4090 for an aggregate cost of 3146 million in 2011 we repurchased approximately 163 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 3276 for an aggregate cost of 5346 million as of december 31 2013  4724 million remained available for further repurchases under the 2013 share buyback program on january 31 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5276 million of common stock which brings the total amount to 10 billion authorized and available under the 2014 share buyback program 

in 2011 we declared and paid a special cash dividend of 275 per share of our common stock totaling 4635 million as a result of the dividend we also paid 1000 million in contingent interest to holders of our subordinated convertible debentures 

as of december 31 2013  we had 125 billion principal amount outstanding of 325 subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 see note 7 “debt and interest expense” of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2013 accordingly the subordinated convertible debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through march 31 2014 we do not expect a material amount of the subordinated convertible debentures to be converted in the near term as the trading price of the debentures exceeds the value that is likely to be received upon conversion however we cannot provide any assurance that the trading price of the debentures will continue to exceed the value that would be derived upon conversion or that the holders will not elect to convert the subordinated convertible debentures 

if a holder elects to convert its subordinated convertible debentures we are permitted under the indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the conversion value as defined in the indenture in cash stock or a combination thereof if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of conversion we currently have the intent and the ability based on current facts and circumstances to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash however if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures that holders actually elect to convert exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2013 2012 and 2011 were as follows 

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

2013 compared to 2012  cash provided by operating activities increased in 2013 primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and decreases in cash paid to employees and vendors offset by an increase in interest paid and income taxes paid cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations during 2013 payments to employees and vendors decreased primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors interest paid increased in 2013 as a result of the issuance of our senior notes in april 2013 income taxes paid increased primarily due to federal income tax payments made during 2013 based on estimated taxable income before we determined that we would claim a worthless stock deduction that ultimately resulted in a tax loss for the year 

2012 compared to 2011  cash provided by operating activities increased in 2012 primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers the payment of 1000 million of contingent interest to the holders of our subordinated convertible debentures during 2011 and a decrease in cash paid to employees and vendors partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes during 2012 cash received from customers increased as the result of growth in sales during 2012 while cash paid to employees and vendors decreased due to a reduction in operating expenses in 2012 the increase in income taxes paid in 2012 was due primarily to an increase in income tax payments made by our foreign subsidiaries 

net cash used in provided by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment 

  

2013 compared to 2012 cash used in investing activities decreased in 2013 primarily due to 14 billion of purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities during 2012 compared to 585 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases in 2013 partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure 

  

2012 compared to 2011 the change in cash used in provided by investing activities is primarily due to 14 billion of purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities during 2012 compared to 4670 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases in 2011 and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment primarily due to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in reston virginia for 1185 million in 2011 

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases proceeds from and repayment of borrowings stock option exercises our employee stock purchase plan “espp” and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

  

2013 compared to 2012 net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchases during 2013 and repayment of the outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility in 2013 partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in 2013 

2012 compared to 2011 net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to the payment of a special cash dividend in 2011 a decrease in the amount of share repurchases made during 2012 and an increase in excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus in 2012 partially offset by 1000 million borrowed under our unsecured credit facility in 2011 and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises and the espp 

impact of inflation 

  

we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

income taxes 

we expect the amount of cash paid for domestic income taxes to increase in future years after the remaining us federal net operating loss carryforwards primarily resulting from the worthless stock deduction are used to offset against future domestic income and the repatriation of funds held by foreign subsidiaries however this increase is expected to be partially offset by the increasing benefit from the interest deduction related to our subordinated convertible debentures the interest expense deducted for income tax purposes is based on the adjusted issue price of the subordinated convertible debentures which grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken for income tax purposes using a comparable yield of 85 and the coupon rate of 325 compounded annually as a result the amount of interest deducted is expected to grow each year while the interest recognized in accordance with gaap will grow at a slower rate this difference will result in a continuing increase in the longterm deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

we expect the amount of cash paid for foreign income taxes to be higher in 2014 primarily related to international withholding taxes on our intended repatriation 

if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the subordinated convertible debentures ie the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date depending on the settlement amount for the subordinated convertible debentures at the settlement date the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial which could adversely impact our cash flow 

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2014 are anticipated to be between 60 million and 80 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio

dilution from subordinated convertible debentures rsus and stock options 

the conversion of our subordinated convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the subordinated convertible debentures we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount “the conversion spread” may be settled in shares of common stock as of december 31 2013 there are 364 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the subordinated convertible debentures based on the ifconverted value of the subordinated convertible debentures as of december 31 2013 the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to 155 million shares of common stock see item 1a “risk factors—we may not have the ability to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures occurrence of certain events related to our subordinated convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting disclosure tax and liquidity implications” of this form 10k 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2013 there are a total of 26 million unvested rsus and outstanding stock options which represent potential dilution of 19 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all rsus vest and are settled there were no stock options granted in the last three years in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and rsu programs however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

our marketable securities consist of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2013 we had 14 billion  of fixed income securities which consisted of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2013 we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 270 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

    

market risk management 

  

the fair market values of our subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes are subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the subordinated convertible debentures are subject to market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures the fair market value will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures and the senior notes but do not impact our financial condition cash flows or results of operations as of december 31 2013 the fair value of the subordinated convertible debentures was approximately 22 billion  and the fair value of the senior notes was 7233 million based on available market information from public data sources 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on subordinated convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the subordinated convertible debentures

  naming services 

  

registry services 

  

registry services operates the authoritative directory of all com net cc tv and  name  domain names and the backend systems for all  gov  jobs  and edu domain names registry services allows individuals and organizations to establish their online identities while providing the secure alwayson access they need to communicate and transact reliably with largescale online audiences 

  

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net  and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” under agreements with icann and also with respect to the com  agreement the us department of commerce “doc” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names in these tlds eg johndoecom and janedoenet our global constellation of domain name servers provides internet protocol “ip” address information in response to queries enabling the use of browsers email systems and other systems on the internet in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the tv  and cc  country code toplevel domains “cctlds” and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs  and edu gtlds these tlds are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system 

  

with our existing gtlds and cctlds we also provide internationalized domain name “idn” services that enable internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language currently idns may be registered in as many as 350 different native languages and scripts 

  

domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years and the fees charged for com and net may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term with respect to  com price increases require prior approval by the doc according to the terms of amendment 32 of the cooperative agreement between the doc and verisign revenues for registrations of name  are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those applicable to com  and  net    however name fees charged are subject to our agreement with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc  and tv  domain names are based on a similar fee system and registration system though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration “gsa” the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the registry operator of jobs no fees are received from operating the edu  registry infrastructure 

historically we have experienced higher domain name growth in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance

as part of our operations infrastructure for our registry services business we operate all authoritative domain name servers that answer domain name lookups for the com  and net  zones as well as for the other tlds for which we are the registry we also operate two of the 13 externally visible root zone server addresses which are considered to be the authoritative root zone servers of the internet’s dns the domain name servers provide the associated authoritative name servers and ip addresses for every com  and net  domain name on the internet and a large number of other tld queries resulting in an annual average of over 60 billion transactions per day these name servers are located around the world and provide local domain name service globally each server facility is a controlled and monitored environment incorporating security and system maintenance features this network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the internet’s dns infrastructure 

in 2012 we continued to expand our infrastructure to meet demand to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically as well as to accommodate projected internet attack trends in 2011 we deployed dnssec in the com  domain to protect the integrity of domain name system data

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we seek to expand our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target  com  and  net  zone growth particularly in emerging international markets and by extending our brand and serving new markets through the internationalized domain names for which we have applied we market our nia services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including direct sales and indirect channels we have marketing and sales offices throughout the world 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services including monitoring and visualization registry provisioning platforms data services value added services and nia services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2012 2011 and 2010 our research and development expenses were 617 million 533 million and 537 million respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones we actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline in conjunction we also continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use in the past we developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be the result of either our own internal development efforts or our cooperative work with suppliers customers and the technology community 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in each of the registry services and nia services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

competition in registry services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum coop and xxx gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 16 registries for the operation of 18 gtlds in addition there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and 38 idn cctld registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of 

marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements with icann which result in registrars or their resellers giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited ari registry services and nominet uk inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann icann announced the introduction of new gtlds which include idn gtlds on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds and such new idn cctlds have started to be introduced into the root on june 13 2012 icann announced it received 1930 applications to operate over 1400 new gtlds with new registration opportunities expected to be available beginning in 2013 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business including if or how the introduction of these new gtlds will affect registrations for com  and net  and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

applicants for new gtlds include companies which may have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do including companies that are existing competitors domain name registrars and new entrants into the domain name industry furthermore icann will allow the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise affiliated with a registrar whereas we are currently prohibited by our agreements with icann and the doc from owning more than 15 of a registrar as a result operators of new gtlds may be able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration icann has also approved a process pursuant to which an operator of an existing gtld could apply to become a registrar with respect to a new gtld at least one gtld operator has used this process however it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc would approve the necessary changes to verisign’s existing agreements to allow us to vertically integrate with respect to new gtlds in which case we may be at a competitive disadvantage 

we have applied for 14 gtlds including 12 idn gtlds there is no certainty that we will ultimately obtain these gtlds and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our competitors similarly while we have entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds there is no guarantee that such applicants will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions or that such domain extensions will be successful furthermore icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year which will delay the granting of some gtlds even though idn gtlds have been given priority other factors related to the application process could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of the application process and our customers’ respective launch plans for the new gtlds 

  in addition our agreements to provide backend registry services directly to other applicants and indirectly through reseller relationships expose us to operational and other risks for example the increase in the number of gtlds for which we provide registry services on a standalone basis or as a backend service provider could further increase costs or increase the frequency or scope of targeted attacks from nefarious actors finally idn tlds face additional challenges in that current desktop or mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize idn tlds and may be slow to adopt standards even if demand for such products is strong 

competition in nia services several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully

industry regulation 

  

registry services within the us government oversight of the dns is provided by the doc effective october 1 2009 the doc and icann entered into a new agreement known as the “affirmation of commitments” which replaced the seventh amendment of the original memorandum of understanding and known as the joint project agreement under the affirmation of commitments the doc became one of several parties working together with other representative constituency members in providing an ongoing review of icann’s performance and accountability the affirmation of commitments sets forth a periodic review process by committees which provide for more international and multidiscipline participation these review panels are charged with reviewing and making recommendations regarding i the accountability and transparency of icann ii the security stability and resiliency of the dns iii the impact of new gtlds on competition consumer trust and consumer choice and iv the effectiveness of icann’s policies with respect to registrant data in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust under the affirmation of commitments the assistant secretary of communications and information of the doc will be a member of the “accountability and transparency” review panel the reviews generally are to occur no less than every three to four years

com  registry agreement on november 29 2012 we entered into a new registry agreement with icann for the com gtld the “ com  registry agreement” the com  registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com  tld through november 30 2018 the new com  registry agreement revised the pricing provisions for com domain name registrations contained in the prior agreement to provide that the price of a com  domain name shall not exceed 785 for the term of the agreement except that the company will continue to have the right to increase the price of a com  domain name during the term subject to the terms of the cooperative agreement as set forth below due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security or stability each as defined in the com  registry agreement of the dns not to exceed 7 above the price in the prior year additionally while the company previously paid icann a flat registry fee of 15 million each month under the new agreement the company no longer pays a flat fee and instead must now pay to icann on a quarterly basis 025 for each annual increment of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k we are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies as well as other provisions pursuant to the com  registry agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations the com  registry agreement also provides a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve additional registry services 

the com  registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed for successive terms unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the com  registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach as further described below verisign may not enter into any renewal of the com  registry agreement or any other extension or continuation of or substitution for the  com  registry agreement without prior written approval by the doc 

  

cooperative agreement on november 29 2012 verisign and the doc entered into amendment number thirtytwo 32 “amendment 32” to the cooperative agreement between verisign and the doc the “cooperative agreement” which approves the renewal of the  com  registry agreement on the terms and conditions described below as in the public interest except as modified by amendment 32 the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement including amendment thirty 30 to the cooperative agreement which was entered into on november 29 2006 by the company and the doc remain unchanged amendment 32 provides that the maximum price as defined in the com  registry agreement of a com  domain name shall not exceed 785 for the term of the com  registry agreement except that the company is entitled to increase the maximum price of a com  domain name due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security or stability of the dns as described in the com  registry agreement provided that the company may not exercise such right unless the doc provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest such approval not to be unreasonably withheld amendment 32 further provides that the company shall be entitled at any time during the term of the  com  registry agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the com  registry agreement if the company demonstrates to the doc that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the com  registry agreement as determined by the doc amendment 32 also provides that the doc’s approval of the com  registry agreement is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on the company

the descriptions of the com  registry agreement amendment 32 amendment 30 the cooperative agreement and the net  registry agreement are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are incorporated by reference as exhibits in this form 10k

some of the services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable us export law as the list of products and countries requiring export approval expands or changes government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals or we violate applicable laws we may not be able to provide some of our services in international markets and may be subject to fines and other penalties 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the us and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property we continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for the verisign mark in the us and other countries and have filed new trademark applications for the new verisign logo covering the same countries we have common law rights in other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services 

  

with regard to our naming services businesses our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our naming services businesses and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses we own our proprietary shared registration system through which registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on open standards set by organizations such as the internet engineering task force “ietf” to the extent any of our patents are considered “standard essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business which closed on august 9 2010 the “closing date” symantec acquired all trademarks primarily used in our authentication services business including our checkmark logo and the geotrust and thawte brand names and we granted symantec a fiveyear license in connection with the verisigncom website the verisigncom website will be operated by symantec for a period of five years following the closing date subject to certain rights of verisign including the right to include links to subdomains operated by us 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function 



we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following   

 

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

our operating results may continue to be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

an unstable global economic social and political environment may have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations including the ongoing hostilities in the middle east natural disasters the eurozone crisis and the us economic environment which is affected by the debt ceiling crisis and the renewed threats of ratings downgrades for example recently the ongoing economic instability in europe has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base and may continue to do so in the future in addition the economic social and political environment has or may negatively impact among other things   

 in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may further negatively impact our business if the market economic social and political conditions in the us and globally do not improve or if they further deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial position as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

the operation of our business depends on numerous factors 

the successful operation of our business depends on numerous factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following   

 12 

substantially all of our revenue is derived from our registry services business limitations on our ability to raise prices on com  registrations could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our registry services business which derives most of its revenues from registration fees for domain names generates substantially all of our revenue if there is a disruption in the registry services business including any disruption from changes in the domain name industry changes in or challenges to our agreements with icann including any changes resulting from legal challenges to these agreements changes in our customers’ or internet users’ preferences a downturn in the economy or changes in technology related to the use of domain names there may be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition a failure of the doc to approve the renewal of the com  registry agreement prior to the expiration of its current term on november 30 2018 could have a material adverse effect on our business 

under the terms of the  com  registry agreement and the cooperative agreement there is uncertainty whether the doc will approve any exercise by the company of its right to increase the price per com  domain name under certain circumstances and whether the company will be able to successfully demonstrate to the doc that market conditions warrant removal of the pricing restrictions on com  domain names each of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations there is also uncertainty of future revenue and profitability and potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to the potential increase in expenses and costs coupled with such factors as restrictions on increasing prices under the com  registry agreement and the cooperative agreement 

issues arising from our agreements with icann the doc and the gsa could harm our registry services business 

we are parties to agreements i with the doc with respect to certain aspects of the dns ii with icann and the doc as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com gtld and iii with icann with respect to being the exclusive registry for the net and name gtlds 

we face risks arising from our agreements with icann and the doc including the following   

 in addition under the com   net  and  name  registry agreements as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are prohibited from holding a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icann accredited registrar this prohibition on crossownership currently applies to all eighteen icann gtlds but does not apply to cctlds icann has adopted a proposal to allow the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise be affiliated with a registrar the impact of these changes to the distribution channel is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition icann has also adopted a procedure pursuant to which an operator of one of the existing eighteen icann gtlds can apply to remove the crossownership restrictions with respect to new but not existing gtlds if verisign were to seek removal of the crossownership restriction with respect to new gtlds it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc approval would be obtained 

  

challenges to internet administration could harm our registry services business 

risks we face from challenges by third parties including governmental authorities in the us and other countries to our role in the ongoing operation of the internet include   

 as a result of these and other risks it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our registry services business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted which may not also apply to our competitors 

our international operations subject our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business   

as of december 31 2012 we had 138 or 13 of our employees outside the us expansion into international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others   

 14 

we are exposed to risks faced by financial institutions 

the hedging transactions we have entered into expose us to credit risk in the event of default by one of our counterparties despite the risk control measures we have in place a default by one of our counterparties or liquidity problems in the financial services industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results   

as of december 31 2012 we had 16 billion  in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 14 billion  was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the eurozone crisis and the us debt ceiling crisis which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues over the past several years the volatility and disruption in the global credit market reached unprecedented levels if the global credit market deteriorates further our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results 

governmental regulation and the application of new and existing laws may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

application of new and existing laws and regulations to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling especially as we consider providing nia services and registry services to this sector counterfeit goods and cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have contracts pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and even though these contracts are immaterial they impose compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation which could be significant to the company 

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

we currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a nonregulated basis root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and data needed to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the tlds these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet consequently our registry services business could be harmed if any of the independent operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls or if it or any of the third parties routing internet communications presents inconsistent data for the tlds or dns generally 

changes in internet user behavior either as a result of evolving technologies or user practices may impact the demand for domain names 

currently internet users often navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet search engines were to change the value of their algorithms on the use of a domain for finding a website iii internet users’ preferences or practices were to shift away from direct navigation iv internet users were to significantly increase the use of web and mobile device applications to locate and access content or v internet users were to increasingly use third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names could decrease 

changes in the level of spending on online advertising andor the way that online networks compensate owners of websites could impact the demand for domain names 

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google and yahoobing have and may continue to adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants which has resulted in and may continue to result in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names for example according to published reports google has in the past and may in the future changed its search algorithm and payperclick advertising policies to provide less compensation for certain types of websites this has made such websites less profitable which has resulted in and may continue to result in fewer domain registrations and renewals in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase as projected or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

changes in state taxation laws and regulations may discourage the registration or renewal of domain names for ecommerce 

many internet merchants are not currently required to pay sales or other similar taxes in respect of shipments of goods into most states however state taxation laws and regulations may change in the future and one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on outofstate companies that engage in online commerce for example the state of georgia passed a new law that requires certain online retailers to collect sales taxes starting october 1 2012 the enactment of any such law in any state may impair the growth of ecommerce and discourage the registration or renewal of domain names for ecommerce 

reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes among third party registrars or their resellers as a result of consolidation or changes in ownership management or strategy could harm our registry services business 

thirdparty registrars and their resellers utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership management or strategy among individual registrars or resellers could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names our registry services business which generates substantially all of our revenue derives most of its revenues from registrations and renewals of domain names and decreased demand for andor renewals of domain names could cause a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from   

 most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from terrorism 

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control 

a failure in the operation of our tld name zone servers the domain name root zone servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server in the event that a registrar has not implemented backup services recommended by us in conformance with industry best practices a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could also result in the deletion of one or more tlds from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those tlds for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

in addition a failure in our nia services could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business could suffer 

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we retain certain customer and employee information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the company as an operator of critical infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated form of attacks such as advanced persistent threat “apt” attacks and zerohour threats which means that the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against the shared registration system the domain name root zone servers and tld name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware and software to our registry services operations we expend significant time and money on the security of our facilities and infrastructure despite our security measures we have been subject to a security breach as first disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2011 and our infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for certain of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the internet engineering task force “ietf” to the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our launching new products and services entering into new markets andor otherwise harm our business some of the software and protocols used in our registry services business are in the public domain which means that such software and protocols are equally available to our competitors 

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to register build equity in or enforce the new logo for the company 

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties the international use of the company’s logo could present additional potential risks for third party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

a third party could claim that the technology we license from other parties infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

we could become involved in claims lawsuits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are and may in the future become involved in other claims lawsuits and investigations such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in lawsuits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the 

amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such investigations claims and lawsuits could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” legal proceedings of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this 10k for further information 

we must establish and maintain strategic channel and other relationships 

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts including in international markets we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our services than we would otherwise 

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

furthermore any changes by our distributors to their existing marketing strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if one or more of our distributors were to encounter financial difficulties or if there were a significant reduction in marketing expenditures by our distributors including registrars or their resellers as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on our business including a decrease in domain name registrations and renewals failure of one or more of our strategic channel or other relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

with the introduction of new gtlds many of our registrars based upon their registrant needs may choose to focus their short or longterm marketing efforts on these new offerings and if we are unable to maintain their focus on our products and services or move through them to engage the same registrants this could harm our business 

  

we continue to explore new strategic initiatives the pursuit of any of which may pose significant risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exploring a variety of possible strategic initiatives which may include among other things the pursuit of new revenue streams services or products changes to our offerings or initiatives to leverage our patent portfolio 

any such strategic initiative may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to develop the initiative related operations and any requisite personnel possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during and after the development process and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the initiative such initiatives may result in a reduction of cash or increased costs we may not be able to successfully or profitably develop integrate operate maintain and manage any such initiative and the related operations or employees in a timely manner or at all furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  including required icann approval of new registry services for such tlds if any new initiative requires icann review we cannot predict whether this process will prevent us from implementing the initiative in a timely manner or at all 

the success of our nia services depends in part on the acceptance of our services 

we are investing in our nia services and the future growth of these services depends in part on the commercial success acceptance and reliability of our nia services these services will suffer if our target customers do not adopt or use these services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our nia services or continue to use these services even after adoption 

we rely on third parties to provide products which are incorporated in our nia services 

the nia services incorporate and rely on third party hardware and software products many of which have unique capabilities if verisign was unable to procure these third party products the nia services may malfunction not perform as well as they should perform not perform as well as they have been performing or not perform as planned and our business could suffer 

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

our registry services and nia services businesses are developing services in emerging markets including services that involve naming and directory services other than registry and related infrastructure services these emerging markets are rapidly evolving may never gain wide acceptance and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services in these markets include the following   

 if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and we may face difficulty attracting and retaining qualified leaders 

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees and we have experienced changes in our management team during the last few years if we are unable to attract integrate retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing employees and implement succession plans for these personnel our business may suffer 

we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include   

 in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our swiss subsidiaries our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates 

various legislative proposals that would reform us corporate tax laws have been proposed by the obama administration as well as members of congress including proposals that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we are unable to predict whether these or other proposals will be implemented although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense or cash flow 

  

our inability to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

deferred income taxes are not provided on most of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be exposed to potential risks if we do not have an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting 

as a public company we are subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require us to report on and receive an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting despite our efforts if we were to fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results or adequately identify and reduce fraud as a result our financial position could be harmed and current and potential future stockholders could lose confidence in us andor our reported financial results which may cause a negative effect on our stock price and we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings which may be costly or divert management attention 

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

we own the land and building in reston virginia which constitutes our headquarters facility ownership of this property as well as our data centers in sterling virginia and new castle delaware may subject us to risks including   

 risks relating to the competitive environment in which we operate 

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

general new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

competition in registry services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum coop and  xxx gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 16 registries for the operation of 18 

gtlds in addition there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and 38 idn cctld registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net  and name  on pricing bundling methods of distribution the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements with icann which result in registrars or their resellers giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited ari registry services and nominet uk inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

competition in network intelligence and availability services  several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully 

we face competition in the network intelligence and availability services industry from companies or services such as isight partners ibm xforce secunia aps dell secureworks mcafee inc prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc neustar inc opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc afilias limited and akamai technologies inc 

we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new tlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann icann announced the introduction of new gtlds which include idn gtlds on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds and such new idn cctlds have started to be introduced into the root on june 13 2012 icann announced it received 1930 applications to operate over 1400 unique new gtlds with new registration opportunities expected to be available beginning in 2013 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business including if or how the introduction of these new gtlds will affect registrations for com  and net  and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

applicants for new gtlds include companies which may have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do including companies that are existing competitors domain name registrars and new entrants into the domain name industry furthermore icann will allow the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise affiliated with a registrar whereas we are currently prohibited by our agreements with icann and the doc from owning more than 15 of a registrar as a result operators of new gtlds may be able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration icann has also approved a process pursuant to which an operator of an existing gtld could apply to become a registrar with respect to a new gtld at least one gtld operator has successfully used this process however it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc would approve the necessary changes to verisign’s existing agreements to allow us to vertically integrate with respect to new gtlds in which case we may be at a competitive disadvantage 

we have applied for 14 gtlds including 12 idn gtlds there is no certainty that we will ultimately obtain these gtlds and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our competitors similarly while we have entered into agreements to provide backend registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds there is no guarantee that such applicants with which we have entered into agreements will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions or that such domain extensions will be successful furthermore icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1000 which will delay the granting of some gtlds even though idn gtlds have been given priority other factors related to the application process that could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of 

the application process and our customers’ respective launch plans for the new gtlds 

  in addition our agreements to provide backend registry services directly to other applicants and indirectly through reseller relationships expose us to operational and other risks for example the increase in the number of gtlds for which we provide registry services on a standalone basis or as a backend service provider could further increase costs or increase the frequency or scope of targeted attacks from nefarious actors finally idn tlds face additional challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize idn tlds and may be slow to adopt standards even if demand for such products is strong 

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market share we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and our customers’ and internet users’ preferences and practices or launch entirely new products and services in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or anticipate or respond successfully or in a cost effective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

risks related to the sale of our authentication services business and the completion of our divestitures 

we face risks related to the terms of the sale of the authentication services business 

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business the “symantec agreement” we agreed to several terms that may pose risks to us including the potential for confusion by the public with respect to symantec’s right to use certain of our trademarks brands and domain names as well as the risk that current or potential investors in or customers of the company may incorrectly attribute to the company problems with symantec products or services that currently use the verisign brand pursuant to a license granted by the company to symantec any such confusion may have a negative impact on our reputation our brand and the market for our products and services in addition we may determine that certain assets transferred to symantec could have been useful in our naming services businesses or in other future endeavors requiring us to forego future opportunities or design or purchase alternatives which could be costly and less effective than the transferred assets further we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect from the sale of our authentication services business 

under the terms of the symantec agreement we have licensed rights to certain of our domain name registrations to symantec we are at risk that our customers will go to a url for a licensed domain name and be unable to locate our registry or nia services in addition we will continue to maintain the registration rights for the domain names licensed to symantec for which symantec has sole control over the displayed content and we may be subject to claims of infringement if symantec posts content that is alleged to infringe the rights of a third party 

we continue to be responsible for certain liabilities following the divestiture of certain businesses 

under the agreements reached with the buyers of certain divested businesses including the authentication services business we remain liable for certain liabilities related to the divested businesses there is a possibility that we will incur unanticipated costs and expenses associated with management of liabilities relating to the businesses we have divested including requests for indemnification by the buyers of the divested businesses these liabilities could potentially relate to i breaches of contractual representations and warranties we gave to the buyers of the divested businesses or ii certain liabilities relating to the divested businesses that we retained under the agreements reached with the buyers of the divested businesses such liabilities could include certain litigation matters including actions brought by third parties where responsibility for such liabilities is to be contractually allocated to the buyer or shared with the buyer or another party it is possible that the buyer or the other party may be in default for payments for which they are responsible obligating us to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of those obligations 

following the divestiture of certain businesses our ability to compete in certain market sectors is restricted 

under the agreements reached with buyers for certain businesses we divested including the authentication services business we are restricted from competing either directly or indirectly with those businesses or from entering certain market sectors for a defined period of time pursuant to negotiated noncompete arrangements 

risks related to our securities 

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance   

as of december 31 2012 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1534 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 180 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding equity and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 the “convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

as a result of the sale of the convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of longterm debt outstanding in addition to the convertible debentures we have a facility with a borrowing capacity of 2000 million as of december 31 2012 we had borrowed 1000 million under the facility the availability of borrowing capacity under the facility allows us immediate access to working capital if we identify opportunities for the use of this cash our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of corporate opportunities the facility is described in note 7 “debt and interest expense” of the notes to consolidated financial statements of our 2012 form 10k 

we may not have the ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of convertible debentures occurrence of certain events related to our convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting disclosure tax and liquidity implications   

as a result of the sale of the convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding holders of our outstanding convertible debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase the convertible debentures upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture dated as of august 20 2007 the “indenture” between the company and us bank national association as trustee although in certain situations the indenture requires us to pay this repurchase price in cash we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all 

if in the future the convertible debentures become convertible and if holders elect to convert their convertible debentures we are permitted under the indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the settlement amount as defined in the indenture in cash stock or a combination thereof we currently have the intent and the ability based on current facts and circumstances to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash however if the principal amount of the convertible debentures due to holders as a result of rights to convert or require repurchase exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional sources of financing to settle the convertible debentures in cash we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the convertible debentures that holders elect to convert or require the company to repurchase 

if we do not have adequate cash available either from cash on hand funds generated from operations or existing financing arrangements or cannot obtain additional financing arrangements we will not be able to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash and in the case of settlement of conversion elections will be required to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in stock if we settle any portion of the principal amount of convertible debentures in stock it will result in immediate dilution to the interests of existing security holders and the dilution could be material to such security holders 

if our intent to settle the principal amount in cash changes or if we conclude that we no longer have the ability in the future we will be required to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the ifconverted method earnings per share will most likely be lower under the ifconverted method as compared to the treasury stock method 

if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the convertible debentures ie the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions the adjusted issue price grows over the term of the convertible debentures due to the difference between the interest deduction for tax using a comparable yield rate of 85 and the coupon rate of 325 compounded annually the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date depending on the settlement amount for the convertible debentures at the settlement date the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial which could adversely impact our cash flow 

a fundamental change may constitute an event of default or prepayment under or result in the acceleration of the maturity of our thenexisting indebtedness our ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or make any other required payments may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time our failure to repurchase the convertible debentures when required would result in an event of default with respect to the convertible debentures

overview 

we are a provider of internet infrastructure services by leveraging our global infrastructure we provide network confidence and availability for missioncritical internet services such as domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services our service capabilities enable realtime resolution for a number of global tlds enable domain name registration through registrars and provide security intelligence and cloudbased network availability services to enterprise customers 

our business consists of one reportable segment naming services which consists of registry services and nia services registry services is the registry operator for all  com   net   cc   tv  and  name  domain names and also operates the backend systems for all  gov   jobs  and  edu  domain names as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 1211 million domain names registered under the  com  and  net  registries our principal registries the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars recently growth in the number of domain names has been hindered by certain factors including the overall economic conditions in europe and changes to search algorithms used by google and other internet search engines that negatively affect the profitability of certain types of websites and as a result reduce demand for new domain name registrations and renewals although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in the us growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us over the longterm nia services provides infrastructure assurance services to organizations and is comprised of idefense managed dns and ddos protection services revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenue 

2012 business highlights and trends

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result we must evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on stock price bond price risk adjusted interest rates volatility and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

  

litigation and contingencies 

  

liabilities for loss contingencies are based on management’s judgment as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the potential amount of loss incurred a liability is recorded when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated these liabilities are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment if actual results differ from these estimates our results of operations could be materially affected in future periods when the contingencies are resolved 

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

  

deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations

we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share under this method only a positive conversion spread related to the convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the ifconverted method which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share 

results of operations 

the following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 



revenues 

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com net cc tv   name gov  and jobs  domain name registries revenues from cc tv name gov  and jobs  are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenue for domain names registered with the com and net  registries we receive a fee from thirdparty registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with thirdparty registrars or their resellers and the thirdparty registrars in turn register the com  net  cc  tv  name  and jobs  domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by increases in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases to the extent permitted by icann and the doc new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising ecommerce and the number of internet users which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars on january 15 2012 we increased our com  domain name registration fees by 7 from 734 to 785 and  net  domain name registration fees by 10 from 465 to 511 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net  domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our  net  agreement with icann through june 30 2017 the price of  com  domain names is fixed at 785 for the duration of the new  com  registry agreement through november 30 2018 except that prices may be raised by up to 7 each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability each as defined in the  com  registry agreement subject to approval of the doc on december 19 2012 we announced that effective july 1 2013 the registry fee for  net  domain names will increase from 511 to 562 we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate all revenues paid to us for com  and net  registrations are in us dollars revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenue 

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

the following table compares domain names ending in com  and net  managed by our registry services business 

  



our revenues increased by  1016 million  in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a an 876 million increase in revenues from the operation of the registries for the  com  and  net tlds and a 138 million increase in other revenues comprised of nia services other tlds and data hosting services the increase in revenues from the  com  and  net  tlds was due to a 6  yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com  and net  and increases in our com and net  registry fees in july 2010 and january 2012 as per our agreements with icann our revenues increased by 914 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to an 8 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com  and net  and increases in our com and net  registry fees in july 2010 as per our agreements with icann 

the growth in the number of active domain names was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs we expect to see continued growth in the number of active domain names in 2013 as a result of further internet growth in addition while we expect to see continued growth internationally in both  com  and  net  domain name bases especially in markets that we have targeted through our marketing programs recently the ongoing economic instability in europe has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base and may continue to do so in the future further according to published reports in 2012 google made and may continue to make changes to its search algorithm and payperclick advertising policies to provide less compensation for certain types of websites this could make such websites less profitable and we believe has resulted in fewer domain registrations moreover we believe that some first time renewing websites affected by this change did not renew during 2012 although growth in the domain name base may be limited by these factors we expect revenues will continue to increase in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as a result of continued growth in the number of active domain names ending in  com  and  net  and the implementation of the  net  price increase which will become effective in july 2013 

mature markets such as the us where broadband and ecommerce have seen strong market penetration are expected to see decreasing incremental growth rates reflecting the maturing of the markets future revenue growth in emea may be hindered due to the unfavorable economic conditions in europe we expect to see larger increases in certain international regions resulting from greater broadband and internet penetration and expanding ecommerce as electronic means of payments are increasingly adopted presentation of geographic revenues is included in note 10 “geographic and customer information” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

during the first half of 2012 icann began the application process for new gtlds including new idn gtlds the application period closed in may 2012 and new domain name registration opportunities for a portion of the approved new gtlds are expected to be available in 2013 we applied for 14 new gtlds including 12 transliterations of  com  and  net in addition applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds selected us to provide backend registry services we cannot predict whether we will be successful in becoming the registry for all or any of the gtlds for which we submitted applications or whether any of the 220 applications for which we would serve as the backend service provider will be successful we also cannot predict whether there will be any delays in icann’s approval process for example icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1000 the application process and availability of domain name registrations for approved new gtlds applied for by verisign or verisign’s customers and the timing of revenue generation if any from these gtlds is uncertain we do not expect to generate significant revenues if any from new gtlds before 2014 

we cannot assess the impact if any the introduction of these new gtlds will have on our revenues and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors—we may face additional competition operational and other risks from the introduction of new tlds by icann which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations” of this form 10k 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  



2012 compared to 2011 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in direct cost of revenues salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses direct cost of revenues increased by 28 million primarily due to increased registry fees required to be paid in the new  tv  and  com  registry agreements which became effective in 2012 and an increase in data hosting costs salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation increased by 19 million primarily due to an increase in the average headcount to support our registry services business and continued growth of our nia services business partially offset by a reduction in the estimated payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses and a decrease in stockbased compensation due to additional vested rsus granted to option holders during 2011 as they did not participate in the may 2011 and december 2010 special cash dividends depreciation expenses decreased by 34 million primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation on an abandoned software project in 2011 and a change in the estimated useful lives of computer hardware and equipment assets from three years to four years beginning in 2012 

2011 compared to 2010 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses depreciation expenses telecommunication expenses contract and professional services expenses and direct cost of revenues partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 74 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support registry services and an increase in stockbased compensation expenses due to additional vested rsus granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the december 2010 and may 2011 special cash dividends depreciation expenses increased by 30 million primarily due to an increase in capitalized hardware and software purchased to support investments in infrastructure projects telecommunication expenses increased by 28 million primarily due to additional circuits required to support the increase in our network infrastructure contract and professional services expenses increased by 12 million primarily due to an increased need for temporary staff direct cost of revenues increased by 11 million primarily due to costs for a new data hosting service allocated overhead expenses decreased by 57 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs 

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to increase slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in registry fees for the  com  and  tv  tlds and an increase in depreciation expenses 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses gtld application costs trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 



2012 compared to 2011 sales and marketing expenses remained consistent with an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses as well as fees paid to icann for new gtld applications offset by a decrease in consulting and advertising expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to an increase in the average headcount related to the expansion of the international marketing team for our registry services business and growth of our nia sales team partially offset by a decrease in the estimated payout for fiscal 2012 bonuses and stockbased compensation expenses due to additional vested rsus granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the december 2010 and may 2011 special cash dividends during 2012 we applied for 14 new gtlds and incurred fees of 26 million related to those applications consulting and advertising expenses decreased by 71 million primarily due to consulting costs related to the new gtld program and product marketing initiatives promoting registry services during 2011 

2011 compared to 2010     sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and consulting expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses advertising and consulting expenses increased by 81 million primarily due to increases in product marketing initiatives promoting registry services salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 78 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount of our sales force and an increase in stockbased compensation expenses due to additional vested rsus granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the december 2010 and may 2011 special cash dividends allocated overhead expenses decreased by 31 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the sales and marketing function as a result of the divestiture of the authentication services business 

  

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to our continued focus on effectively managing our expenses 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead 

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 



2012 compared to 2011 research and development expenses increased primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses and contract and professional services expenses partially offset by an increase in capitalized labor salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation expenses increased by 66 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our dns infrastructure and new services partially offset by a decrease in the estimated payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses contract and professional services expenses increased by 30 million primarily to support projects in our nia services business capitalized labor increased by 21 million primarily due to an increase in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects 

2011 compared to 2010     research and development expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in allocated overhead expenses and an increase in capitalized labor partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses and contract and professional services expenses allocated overhead expenses decreased by 34 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs capitalized labor increased by 13 million primarily due to an increase in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 25 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our dns infrastructure and new services contract and professional services expenses increased by 11 million in 2011 primarily due to an increased need for temporary staff 

  

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2013 as compared to 2012 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types 

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

2012 compared to 2011 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses including stockbased compensation contract and professional services expenses occupancy expenses receipts from the settlement of indemnification claims with the former shareholders of an acquired business and an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types partially offset by increases in depreciation expenses legal expenses and miscellaneous general and administrative expenses salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 156 million including a 44 million decrease in stockbased compensation primarily due to the reduced headcount in corporate support functions subsequent to the divestiture of the authentication services business and a reduction in estimated payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses stockbased compensation expenses also decreased due to additional vested rsus granted to option holders during 2011 as they did not participate in the may 2011 and december 2010 special cash dividends partially offset by 14 million of stockbased compensation expense for fully vested rsus granted to members of the board of directors during 2012 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 49 million primarily due to reductions in consulting services expenses and reductions in temporary staffing upon completion of the transition of certain corporate functions from california to virginia in 2011 occupancy expenses decreased by 63 million primarily due to lower rent expense as we exited leased facilities in mountain view california and dulles virginia and purchased our corporate headquarters facility in reston virginia during 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized a credit of 45 million related to reimbursements of previously incurred legal costs received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business overhead expenses allocated to other cost types increased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in the relative headcount of the general and administrative function compared to other functions subsequent to the completion of the 2010 restructuring plan and the transition of corporate functions from california to virginia depreciation expenses increased by 32 million primarily due to the additional depreciation related to our new corporate headquarters legal expenses increased by 52 million primarily due to an insurance recovery in 2011 related to a certain legal matter as well as legal and other support related to the doc’s review of the renewal of our  com  registry agreement with icann and legal advice related to icann’s new gtld program in 2012 miscellaneous expenses increased by 48 million primarily due to the release of 59 million of liabilities related to nonincome tax expenses as a result of the lapse of the statutes of limitations during 2011

restructuring charges 

see note 6 “restructuring charges” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

interest expense 

interest expense consists of contractual interest payments on convertible debentures amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs on the liability component of our convertible debentures contingent interest payments to holders of our convertible debentures interest expenses related to our current 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility offset by capitalized interest 

  

a comparison of interest expense is presented below 



the indenture governing the convertible debentures requires the payment of contingent interest to the holders of the convertible debentures if the board declares a dividend to our stockholders that is designated by the board as an extraordinary dividend the contingent interest is calculated as the amount derived by multiplying the per share declared dividend with the ifconverted number of shares applicable to the convertible debentures the board declared extraordinary dividends in april 2011 and december 2010 and consequently we paid 1000 million and 1091 million contingent interest respectively to holders of the convertible debentures 

nonoperating income net 

see note 12 “nonoperating income net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for 2012 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates and a decrease in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible stock based compensation 

our effective tax rate for 2011 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates partially offset by an increase in the accrual for uncertain tax positions tax expense related to a foreign currency transaction gain realized on the distribution of previously taxed income state income taxes and nondeductible stock based compensation 

  

our effective tax rate for 2010 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates and a change in estimated tax expense related to a divested business partially offset by an increase in accruals for uncertain tax positions state income taxes and nondeductible stockbased compensation 

as of december 31 2012 we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 1381 million before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities with the exception of deferred tax assets related to book and tax bases differences of certain investments and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards increased in 2012 primarily due to a tax rate change resulting from the expiration of a tax holiday in one of the jurisdictions in switzerland this increase in deferred tax assets was partially offset by an increase in the corresponding valuation allowance which resulted from the tax rate change the impact of this tax rate change on our deferred tax assets and the offsetting valuation allowance together with the release of valuation allowances related to investments with differing book and tax bases reduced income tax expense by 53 million in 2012 

    

we qualify for a tax holiday in switzerland until 2015 which provides reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also requires certain thresholds of investment and employment another tax holiday specific to one of the jurisdictions in switzerland expired on december 31 2011 increasing our tax rate from 127 to 255 in india our exemption related to the software technology park of india “stpi” tax program expired on march 31 2011 following the expiration we are subject to the regular statutory tax rate of 33 in india these tax holidays increased our diluted earnings per share by 011 in 2012 006 in 2011 and 012 in 2010 

income from discontinued operations net of tax 

see note 4 “discontinued operations” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of december 31 2012  our principal source of liquidity was 1307 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 14 billion  of marketable securities the marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and us treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days 

the change in the mix of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to 14 billion of purchases of us treasury bills net of sales and maturities during 2012 using funds held by foreign subsidiaries all of the us treasury bills purchased have contractual maturities of less than one year approximately 330 million of marketable securities held as of december 31 2012  have contractual maturities between one year and three years our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “cash cash equivalents and marketable securities” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2012  the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 13 billion our intent is to indefinitely reinvest outside of the us those funds held by foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the us currently we do not anticipate that we will need funds that were generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the us and if us tax has not already been provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

we purchased marketable securities of 26 billion and received 12 billion from sales and maturities of marketable securities in 2012 we purchased marketable securities of 790 million and received 5460 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities in 2011 we purchased marketable securities of 7877 million and received 2846 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities in 2010 

in 2012 we repurchased 77 million  shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 4090 for an aggregate cost of 3146 million in 2011 we repurchased approximately 163 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 3276 for an aggregate cost of 5346 million in 2010 we repurchased approximately 157 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 2793 for an aggregate cost of 4377 million as of december 31 2012 9755 million remained available for further repurchases under the 2012 share buyback program 

in 2011 we declared and paid a special cash dividend of 275 per share of our common stock totaling 4635 million as a result of the dividend we also paid 1000 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures in 2010 we declared and paid a special dividend of 300 per share of our common stock totaling 5182 million as a result of the dividend we also paid 1091 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures 

in 2011 we entered into a 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and borrowed 1000 million from this facility in connection with the purchase of our new corporate headquarters building in reston virginia for approximately 1185 million our credit facility is discussed in more detail in note 7 “debt and interest expense” 2011 credit facility  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2012 we had 125 billion principal amount outstanding of 325 convertible debentures due 2037 see note 7 “debt and interest expense” of the accompanying consolidated financial statements the convertible debentures will mature in august 2037 unless earlier repurchased redeemed or converted our convertible debentures were convertible at the option of each holder during the three months ending december 31 2012 as our common stock price exceeded the conversion price threshold during the relevant measuring period for the three months ended september 30 2012 accordingly as at september 30 2012 we reclassified the carrying value of the debt component of the convertible debentures the related embedded derivative and deferred tax liabilities from longterm liabilities to current liabilities and the associated unamortized debt issuance costs from longterm assets to current assets our common stock price did not exceed the conversion price threshold during the relevant measuring period for the three months ended december 31 2012 and consequently the convertible debentures are no longer convertible starting january 1 2013 until one of the conversion criteria is met in the future accordingly as at december 31 2012 we reclassified the carrying value of the debt component of the convertible debentures the related embedded derivative and deferred tax liabilities back to longterm liabilities and the associated unamortized debt issuance costs back to longterm assets in future fiscal periods the convertible debentures related liabilities and assets will be classified as current or longterm depending on whether any of the conversion criteria is met or not at the end of that fiscal period 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds generated from operations together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

in summary our cash flows for 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

  

2012 compared to 2011  cash provided by operating activities increased in 2012 primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers the payment of 1000 million of contingent interest to the holders of our convertible debentures during 2011 and a decrease in cash paid to employees and vendors partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes during 2012 cash received from customers increased as the result of growth in sales during 2012 while cash paid to employees and vendors decreased due to a reduction in operating expenses in 2012 the increase in income taxes paid in 2012 was due primarily to an increase in income tax payments made by our foreign subsidiaries 

2011 compared to 2010  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher income taxes payable in 2010 primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the authentication services business before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus and a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees the increase was offset by a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues due to the divestiture of the authentication services business in 2010 

net cash used in provided by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to divestiture of businesses timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments and purchases of property and equipment 

  

2012 compared to 2011 the change in cash used in provided by investing activities is primarily due to 14 billion of purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities during 2012 compared to 4670 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases in 2011 and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment primarily due to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in reston virginia for 1185 million in 2011 

2011 compared to 2010   the decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to proceeds received from the divestiture of businesses in 2010 and the purchase of our corporate headquarters in reston virginia in 2011 partially offset by an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments and a decrease in purchases of marketable securities 

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases borrowings from our credit facility stock option exercises our employee stock purchase plan “espp” excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and dividend payments 

  

2012 compared to 2011 net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to the payment of a special cash dividend in 2011 a decrease in the amount of share repurchases made during 2012 and an increase in excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus in 2012 partially offset by 1000 million borrowed under our credit facility in 2011 and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises and the espp 

  

2011 compared to 2010    net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and a decrease in realized excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus the increase is partially offset by 1000 million borrowed under our credit facility in 2011 and a lower special dividend paid in 2011 compared to 2010 

impact of inflation 

  

we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

income taxes 

as of december 31 2012 we have used the majority of our us federal net operating loss carryforwards as such we expect the amount of cash paid for domestic income taxes to increase in 2013 although this increase is expected to be partially offset by the increasing benefit from the interest deduction related to our convertible debentures the interest expense deducted for income tax purposes is based on the adjusted issue price of the convertible debentures which grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken for income tax purposes using a comparable yield of 85 and the coupon rate of 325 compounded annually as a result the amount of interest deducted is expected to grow each year while the interest recognized in accordance with gaap will grow at a slower rate this difference will result in a continuing increase in the longterm deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

 if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the convertible debentures ie the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date depending on the settlement amount for the convertible debentures at the settlement date the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial which could adversely impact our cash flow 

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2013 are anticipated to be between 60 million and 80 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

contractual obligations 

  

see note 14 “commitments and contingencies ” purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k

offbalance sheet arrangements

the conversion of our convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the convertible debentures we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount “the conversion spread” may be settled in shares of common stock as of december 31 2012 there are 364 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible debentures based on the ifconverted value of the convertible debentures as of december 31 2012 the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to 42 million shares of common stock see item 1a “risk factors—we may not have the ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of convertible debentures occurrence of certain events related to our convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting disclosure tax and liquidity implications” of this form 10k 

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2012 there are a total of 29 million unvested rsus and outstanding stock options which represent potential dilution of 19 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all rsus vest and are settled there were no stock options granted in 2012 or 2011 in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and rsu programs however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

the interest rates on our revolving credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2012 we had 1000 million outstanding under our credit facility a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on our interest expense in 2013 

our marketable securities consist of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2012 we had 15 billion  of fixed income securities which consisted primarily of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year a hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2012 we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 402 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and nonmonetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

    

market risk management 

  

the fair market value of our convertible debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations as of december 31 2012 the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately 16 billion  based on available market information from public data sources 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures

the us department of commerce “doc” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names in these toplevel domains eg johndoecom and janedoenet these toplevel domains are supported by our global constellation of domain name servers in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the tv and cc country code toplevel domains “cctlds” and to operate the backend registry systems for the gov  jobs and edu gtlds these toplevel domains are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system

domain names can be registered for between one and ten years and the fees charged for com and net may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term revenues for registrations of name are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those applicable to com and net however name fees charged are subject to our agreement with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc and tv domain names are based on a similar fee system and registration system though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann the fees received from operating the  gov registry are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the us general services administration “gsa” the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the registry operator of jobs no fees are received from operating the edu registry infrastructure

research and development 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced internet security ecommerce information and technologies is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2011 2010 and 2009 our research and development expenses were 533 million 537 million and 524 million respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we developed our services both independently and through efforts with 

  

leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in each of the registry services and nia services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

  

competition in registry services   we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum coop and xxx gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 16 registries for the operation of 18 gtlds in addition there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and 38 idn cctld registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling methods of distribution and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements with icann which result in registrars giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited ari registry services and nominet uk inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

  

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann these include idn tlds and the upcoming introduction of new gtlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds and such new idn cctlds have started to be introduced into the root an application period for other new domain extensions including ones for which we could apply opened in january 2012 with new registration opportunities available by the beginning of 2013 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business applicants for such new tlds may have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do furthermore icann will allow the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise affiliated with a registrar whereas we are currently prohibited by our agreements with icann and the doc from owning more than 15 of a registrar as a result operators of new gtlds may be able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration icann has also approved a process pursuant to which an operator of an existing gtld could apply to become a registrar with respect to a new gtld however it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc would approve the necessary changes to verisign’s existing agreements to allow us to 

  

  

  

vertically integrate with respect to new gtlds in which case we may be at a competitive disadvantage while we intend to apply for one or more of these new domain extensions there is no certainty that we will ultimately be successful and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our competitors similarly while we may provide backend registry services to other applicants for new gtlds we face competition from other backend registry service providers and there is no guarantee that such applicants we do enter into agreements with will be successful in obtaining one or more these new domain extensions or that such domain extensions will be successful 

  

competition in network intelligence and availability services   several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully

with regard to our naming services businesses our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our naming services businesses and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses including the conversion of idns we own our proprietary shared registration system through which registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors 

  

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business which closed on august 9 2010 the “closing date” symantec acquired all trademarks primarily used in our authentication services business including our checkmark logo and the geotrust and thawte brand names and we granted symantec a fiveyear license in connection with the verisigncom website the verisigncom website will be operated by symantec for a period of five years following the closing date subject to certain rights of verisign including the right to include links to subdomains operated by us 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function including historical headcount associated with the divested and wounddown businesses 

 

   

we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our operating results may continue to be adversely affected as a result of unfavorable market economic social and political conditions 

  

an unstable global economic social and political environment may have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations including the ongoing hostilities in the middle east natural disasters the eurozone crisis and the us debt ceiling crisis the economic social and political environment has or may negatively impact among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may further negatively impact our business if the market economic social and political conditions in the us and globally do not improve or if they further deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial position as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

  

we may experience significant fluctuations in our financial results 

  

the successful operation of our business depends on numerous factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

issues arising from our agreements with icann the doc and the gsa could harm our registry services business 

  

we are parties to agreements i with the doc with respect to certain aspects of the dns ii with icann and the doc as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com gtld and iii with icann with respect to being the exclusive registry for the net and name gtlds 

  

we face risks arising from our agreements with icann and the doc including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

in addition under the  com   net and  name registry agreements as well as the cooperative agreement with the doc we are prohibited from holding a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icann accredited registrar this prohibition on crossownership currently applies to all eighteen icann gtlds but does not apply to cctlds icann has adopted a proposal to allow the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise be affiliated with a registrar the impact of these changes to the distribution channel is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition icann has also adopted a procedure pursuant to which an operator of one of the existing eighteen icann gtlds can apply to remove the crossownership restrictions with respect to new but not existing gtlds if verisign were to seek removal of the crossownership restriction with respect to new gtlds it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc approval would be obtained 

  

substantially all of our revenue is derived from our registry services business 

  

our registry services business which derives most of its revenues from registration fees for domain names generates substantially all of our revenue if there is a disruption in the registry services business including any disruption from changes in the domain name industry changes in or challenges to our agreements with icann including any changes resulting from legal challenges to these agreements changes in customer preferences a downturn in the economy or changes in technology related to the use of domain names there may be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition a failure of the com registry agreement to renew on the same or similar terms when it expires in 2012 could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

challenges to internet administration could harm our registry services business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including governmental authorities in the us and other countries to our role in the ongoing operation of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other risks it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our registry services business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted which may not also apply to our competitors 

  

our international operations subject our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had 117 or 12 of our employees outside the us expansion into international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business 

  

practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are exposed to risks faced by financial institutions 

  

the hedging transactions we have entered into expose us to credit risk in the event of default by one of our counterparties despite the risk control measures we have in place a default by one of our counterparties or liquidity problems in the financial services industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had 14 billion in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 329 million was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

  

  

  

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the eurozone crisis and the us debt ceiling crisis which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues over the past several years the volatility and disruption in the global credit market reached unprecedented levels if the global credit market deteriorates further our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results 

  

governmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

application of new and existing laws and regulations to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

  

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling especially as we consider providing nia services to this sector counterfeit goods and cybersquatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have contracts pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and even though these contracts are immaterial they impose compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation which could be significant to the company 

  

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the thirteen root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a nonregulated basis root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and data needed to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the toplevel domains these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet consequently our registry services business could be harmed if these independent operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our registry services business could be harmed if any of the independent operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls or presents inconsistent data for the toplevel domains 

  

changes in customer behavior either as a result of evolving technologies or user practices may impact the demand for domain names 

  

currently internet users navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet search engines changed the value of their algorithms on the use of a domain for finding 

  

a website iii internet users’ preferences or practices were to shift away from direct navigation iv internet users were to increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content or v internet users were to increase the use of second or third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking and microblogging sites in each case the demand for domain names could decrease 

  

changes in the level of spending on online advertising andor the way that online networks compensate owners of websites could impact the demand for domain names 

  

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google and yahoo could adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants resulting in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names in addition as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase as projected or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

  

consolidation or changes in ownership or management among thirdparty registrars could result in reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could harm our registry services business 

  

thirdparty registrars utilize substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand andor renewal rates for domain names consolidation in the registrar industry or changes in ownership or management among individual registrars could result in significant changes to their business operating model and cost structure such changes could include reduced marketing efforts or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand andor the renewal rates for domain names our registry services business which generates substantially all of our revenue derives most of its revenues from registrations and renewals of domain names and decreased demand for andor renewals of domain names could cause a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

if we encounter system interruptions or failures we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

   

  

  

   

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to primary alternate or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from terrorism 

  

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past 

  

a failure in the operation of our toplevel domain name zone servers the domain name root zone servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server in the event that a registrar has not implemented back up services recommended by us in conformance with industry best practices a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could also result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time or a misdirection of a domain name to a different server any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

in addition a failure in our nia services could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business could suffer 

  

we experienced security breaches in the corporate network in 2010 which were not sufficiently reported to management 

  

in 2010 the company faced several successful attacks against its corporate network in which access was gained to information on a small portion of our computers and servers we have investigated and do not believe these attacks breached the servers that support our dns network as all dns zone files were and are protected by a series of integrity checks including realtime monitoring and validation information stored on some of the compromised corporate systems was exfiltrated the company’s information security group was aware of the attacks shortly after the time of their occurrence and the group implemented remedial measures designed to mitigate the attacks and to detect and thwart similar additional attacks however given the nature of such attacks we cannot assure that our remedial actions will be sufficient to thwart future attacks or prevent the future loss of information in addition although the company is unaware of any situation in which possibly exfiltrated information has been used we are unable to assure that such information was not or could not be used in the future 

  

the occurrences of the attacks were not sufficiently reported to the company’s management at the time they occurred for the purpose of assessing any disclosure requirements management was informed of the incident in september 2011 and following the review the company’s management concluded that our disclosure controls 

  

and procedures are effective however the company has implemented reporting line and escalation organization changes procedures and processes to strengthen the company’s disclosure controls and procedures in this area see item 9a “controls and procedures” in part ii of this report 

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain customer and employee information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the company as an operator of critical infrastructure is frequently targeted and experiences a high rate of attacks these include the most sophisticated form of attacks such as advanced persistent threat “apt” attacks and zerohour threats which means that the threat is not compiled or has been previously unobserved within our observation and threat indicators space until the moment it is launched making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and defend against the shared registration system the domain name root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware and software to our registry services operations we expend significant time and money on the security of our facilities and infrastructure despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems including hacktivism it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for certain of our businesses all or any of which could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over the internet as well as of the security or reliability of our services for example in 2010 our corporate network was breached see “risk factors—we experienced security breaches in the corporate network in 2010 which were not sufficiently reported to management” 

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our business would suffer if we lost the rights to use certain of these technologies additionally another party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not 

  

  

  

indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could harm our business 

  

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business we are at risk that we will be unable to register build equity in or enforce the new logo for the company 

  

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

  

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties the international launch of the new logo for the company could present additional potential risks for third party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement was made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

  

we could become involved in claims lawsuits or investigations that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we may become involved in other claims lawsuits and investigations such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in lawsuits and investigations could result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations given the inherent uncertainties in litigation even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach in addition such investigations claims and lawsuits could involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic channel and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts including in international markets we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our services than we would otherwise 

  

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

  

furthermore any changes by our distributors to their existing marketing strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if one or more of our distributors were to encounter financial difficulties or if there were a significant reduction in marketing expenditures by our distributors including registrars as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on our business including a decrease in domain name registrations and renewals failure of one or more of our strategic channel or other relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

the success of our nia services depends in part on the acceptance of our services 

  

we are investing in our nia services and the future growth of these services depends in part on the commercial success acceptance and reliability of our nia services these services will suffer if our target customers do not adopt or use these services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our nia services or continue to use these services even after adoption 

  

we rely on third parties to provide products which are incorporated in our nia services 

  

the nia services incorporate and rely on third party hardware and software products many of which have unique capabilities if verisign was unable to procure these third party products the nia services may malfunction not perform as well as they should perform not perform as well as they have been performing or not perform as planned and our business could suffer 

  

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

  

our registry services and nia services businesses are developing services in emerging markets including services that involve naming and directory services other than registry and related infrastructure services these emerging markets are rapidly evolving may never gain wide acceptance and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services in these markets include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

  

we depend on key employees to manage our business effectively and have experienced changes in our senior management team and we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining fulltime qualified leaders 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success also depends on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing employees both in the us and abroad 

  

  

  

during the third quarter of 2011 our board appointed d james bidzos our executive chairman as president and chief executive officer and john calys our vice president controller as interim chief financial officer following the resignations of our president and chief executive officer and our chief financial officer respectively the search for a regular fulltime replacement to fill the chief financial officer position may be a distraction to our senior management business partners and customers and although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to address the impact of these departures there is a risk that such changes may impair our ability to meet our business objectives during the period of transition following the appointment of a permanent chief financial officer there may be operational inefficiencies as the chief financial officer becomes familiar with our business and operations we cannot provide you with any assurance that the search for any replacements will be successful and if we cannot recruit or experience delays in recruiting a qualified regular fulltime replacement for such position our business may suffer 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control or the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock and may make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan 

  

   

   

   

in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may 

  

impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

  

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

  

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our swiss subsidiaries our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates 

  

various legislative proposals that would reform us corporate tax laws have been proposed by the obama administration as well as members of congress we are unable to predict whether these or other proposals will be implemented we have not yet determined whether or the extent to which these proposals will ultimately impact us 

  

our inability to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we are subject to the risks of owning real property 

  

we closed on the purchase of the land and building in reston virginia constituting our headquarters facility on november 15 2011 ownership of this property may subject us to risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

risks relating to the competitive environment in which we operate 

  

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

  

general new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

competition in registry services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum coop and xxx gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 16 registries for the operation of 18 gtlds in addition there are over 250 latin script cctld registries and 38 idn cctld registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling methods of distribution and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage if other registries launch marketing campaigns for new or existing tlds including forms of marketing campaigns that we are prohibited from running under the terms of our agreements with icann which result in registrars giving other tlds greater prominence on their websites advertising or marketing materials we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business could suffer 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited ari registry services and nominet uk inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines or social media as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc operators of social networks such as facebook and operators of microblogging tools such as twitter furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications 

  

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann these include idn tlds and the upcoming introduction of new gtlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds and such new idn cctlds have started to be introduced into the root an application period for other new domain extensions including ones for which we could apply opened in january 2012 with new registration opportunities available by the beginning of 2013 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business applicants for such new tlds may have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do furthermore icann will allow the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise affiliated with a registrar whereas we are currently prohibited by our agreements with icann and the doc from owning more than 15 of a registrar as a result operators of new gtlds may be able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration icann has also approved a process pursuant to which an operator of an existing gtld could apply to become a registrar with respect to a new gtld however it is uncertain whether icann andor the doc would approve the necessary changes to verisign’s existing agreements to allow us to vertically integrate with respect to new gtlds in which case we may be at a competitive disadvantage while we intend to apply for one or more of these new domain extensions there is no certainty that we will ultimately be successful and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our 

  

competitors similarly while we may provide backend registry services to other applicants for new gtlds we face competition from other backend registry service providers and there is no guarantee that such applicants we do enter into agreements with will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions or that such domain extensions will be successful 

  

competition in network intelligence and availability services several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully 

  

we face competition in the network intelligence and availability services industry from companies or services such as isight partners security services xforce threat analysis service secunia aps dell secureworks mcafee inc prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc’s dynect platform neustar ultra services opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc and afilias limited 

  

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

  

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings or alternatives to our products and services in order to remain competitive and retain our market share we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and customer preferences and practices or launch entirely new products and services in anticipation of or in response to market trends we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or anticipate or respond successfully or in a cost effective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

  

risks related to the sale of our authentication services business and the completion of our divestitures 

  

we face risks related to the terms of the sale of the authentication services business 

  

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business the “symantec agreement” we agreed to several terms that may pose risks to us including the potential for confusion by the public with respect to symantec’s right to use certain of our trademarks brands and domain names as well as the risk that current or potential investors in or customers of the company may incorrectly attribute to the company problems with symantec products or services that currently use the verisign brand pursuant to a license granted by the company to symantec any such confusion may have a negative impact on our reputation our brand and the market for our products and services in addition we may determine that certain assets transferred to symantec could have been useful in our naming services businesses or in other future endeavors requiring us to forego future opportunities or design or purchase alternatives which could be costly and less effective than the transferred assets further we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect from the sale of our authentication services business 

  

under the terms of the symantec agreement we have licensed rights to certain of our domain name registrations to symantec we are at risk that our customers will go to a url for a licensed domain name and be unable to locate our registry or nia services in addition we will continue to maintain the registration rights for 

  

  

  

the domain names licensed to symantec for which symantec has sole control over the displayed content and we may be subject to claims of infringement if symantec posts content that is alleged to infringe the rights of a third party 

  

we continue to be responsible for certain liabilities and transition services following the divestiture of certain businesses 

  

under the agreements reached with the buyers of certain divested businesses including the authentication services business we remain liable for certain liabilities related to the divested businesses in addition we have entered into and may in the future amend or extend a transition services agreement with symantec in connection with the divestiture of the authentication services business these transition services may be required for a longer period of time than anticipated by management and currently we are obligated to provide the transition services at a fixed price but our actual costs to provide such services may exceed the fees symantec is contractually obligated to pay 

  

there is a possibility that we will incur unanticipated costs and expenses associated with management of liabilities relating to the businesses we have divested including requests for indemnification by the buyers of the divested businesses these liabilities could potentially relate to i breaches of contractual representations and warranties we gave to the buyers of the divested businesses or ii certain liabilities relating to the divested businesses that we retained under the agreements reached with the buyers of the divested businesses such liabilities could include certain litigation matters including actions brought by third parties where responsibility for such liabilities is to be contractually allocated to the buyer or shared with the buyer or another party it is possible that the buyer or the other party may be in default for payments for which they are responsible obligating us to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of those obligations 

  

following the divestiture of certain businesses our ability to compete in certain market sectors is restricted 

  

under the agreements reached with buyers for certain businesses we divested including the authentication services business we are restricted from competing either directly or indirectly with those businesses or from entering certain market sectors for a defined period of time pursuant to negotiated noncompete arrangements 

  

risks related to our securities 

  

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1594 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 199 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 the “convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

  

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

  

as a result of the sale of the convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of longterm debt outstanding in addition to the convertible debentures we have a facility with a borrowing capacity of 2000 million as of december 31 2011 we had borrowed 1000 million under the facility the availability of borrowing capacity under the facility allows us immediate access to working capital if we identify opportunities 

  

for the use of this cash our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of corporate opportunities the facility is described in note 7 “debt and interest expense” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

  

we may not have the ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of convertible debentures as required by the indenture governing the convertible debentures 

  

as a result of the sale of the convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of longterm debt outstanding holders of our outstanding convertible debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase the convertible debentures upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture dated as of august 20 2007 the “indenture” between the company and us bank national association as trustee although we currently intend to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash as required under the indenture we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all in addition upon conversion of the convertible debentures we will be required to make cash payments to the holders of the convertible debentures equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the convertible debentures being converted and the conversion value as defined in the indenture of those debentures such payments could be significant and we may not have sufficient funds to make them at such time 

  

a fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under or result in the acceleration of the maturity of our thenexisting indebtedness our ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or make any other required payments may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time our failure to repurchase the convertible debentures or pay cash in respect of conversions when required would result in an event of default with respect to the convertible debentures 

  

while we currently have the intent and ability to settle the principal in cash if we conclude that we no longer have the ability in the future we will be required to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the ifconverted method

the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views to the extent we have met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations in the past does not necessarily mean that we will be able to do so in the future in the past securities class action lawsuits have often followed periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources

overview 

  

we are a provider of internet infrastructure services by leveraging our global infrastructure we provide network confidence and availability for missioncritical internet services such as domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services our service capabilities enable domain name registration through registrars and provide network availability for registrars and internet users alike

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result we must evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on stock price bond price risk adjusted interest rates volatility and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

litigation and contingencies 

  

liabilities for loss contingencies are based on management’s judgment as to the potential amount of loss incurred a liability is recorded when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

  

these liabilities are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment if actual results differ from these estimates our results of operations could be materially affected in future periods when the contingencies are resolved 

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

  

deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

earnings per share 

  

we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share under this method only a positive conversion spread related to the convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations this is based on management’s intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the debt in cash a change in management’s intent and ability would require us to use the ifconverted method which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share 

  

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth selected information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 

 

   

revenues 

  

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com net cc tv   name gov and jobs domain name registries revenues from cc tv name gov and jobs are not significant for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee from thirdparty registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with thirdparty registrars or their resellers and the thirdparty registrars in turn register the com  net  cc  tv  name gov and jobs domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by increases in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations in each case as impacted by continued internet growth promotional marketing programs marketing expenditure by thirdparty registrars as well as fee increases as permitted under our agreements with icann on july 1 2010 we increased our com domain name registration fees by 7 from 686 to 734 and our net domain name registration fees by 10 from 423 to 465 in july 2011 we announced another fee increase for com domain name registrations of 7 from 734 to 785 and for  net domain name registrations of 10 from 465 to 511 the fee increases announced in july 2011 became effective january 15 2012 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 each year during the term of our renewed agreement with icann through june 30 2017 we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we are largely insulated from the risk posed by fluctuations in exchange rates due to the fact that all revenues paid to us for com and net registrations are in us dollars revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenue 

  

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

 

   

the following table compares domain names ending in com and net managed by our registry services business 

 

   

our revenues increased by 914 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to an 8 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and increases in our com and net registry fees in july 2010 as per our agreements with icann our revenues increased by 646 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a 9 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and increases in our com and net registry fees in october 2008 and july 2010 as per our agreements with icann partially offset by a 76 million decrease in revenues because of a onetime project in the us that was completed in 2009 

  

the growth in the number of active domain names was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs we expect to see continued growth in the number of active domain names in 2012 as a result of further internet growth in addition we expect to see continued growth internationally in both com and net domain name bases especially in markets that we have targeted through our marketing programs we expect revenues to increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of continued growth in the number of active domain names ending in com and net and implementation of the price increase which became effective in january 2012 as domain names are renewed at the increased price 

  

mature markets such as the us where broadband and ecommerce have seen strong market penetration are expected to see decreasing incremental growth rates reflecting the maturing of the markets we expect to see larger increases in certain international regions resulting from greater broadband and internet penetration and expanding ecommerce as electronic means of payments are increasingly adopted presentation of geographic revenues is included in note 10 “geographic and customer information” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

new tlds including new idn tlds cctlds and gtlds may be introduced by icann in 2012 we cannot assess the impact if any the introduction of these new tlds will have on our revenues and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors— the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share ” of this form 10k  

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel that manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

  

  

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

 

   

2011 compared to 2010 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses depreciation expenses telecommunication expenses contract and professional services expenses and direct cost of revenues partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 74 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support registry services and an increase in stockbased compensation expenses due to additional vested rsus granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the december 2010 and may 2011 special cash dividends depreciation expenses increased by 30 million primarily due to an increase in capitalized hardware and software purchased to support investments in infrastructure projects telecommunication expenses increased by 28 million primarily due to additional circuits required to support the increase in our network infrastructure contract and professional services expenses increased by 12 million primarily due to an increased need for temporary staff direct cost of revenues increased by 11 million primarily due to costs for a new data hosting service allocated overhead expenses decreased by 57 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs 

  

2010 compared to 2009 cost of revenues decreased primarily due to decreases in allocated overhead expenses expenses related to a onetime revenue project occupancy expenses contract and professional services expenses and equipment and software expenses partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses depreciation expenses telecommunication expenses and fees paid to icann allocated overhead expenses decreased by 142 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the cost of revenues function as a result of the divestitures in 2010 and 2009 expenses related to a onetime revenue project that was completed in 2009 decreased by 45 million occupancy expenses decreased by 24 million primarily due to the purchase in december 2009 of a previously leased facility management costsaving initiatives to reduce overall utility expenses and the elimination of certain shared services utility expenses as a result of the sale of the authentication services business contract and professional services expenses decreased by 18 million primarily due to a decrease in the need for such external services and the increase in internal resources equipment and software expenses decreased by 12 million primarily due to a decrease in equipment and software maintenance contracts required to support the business as a result of the sale of the authentication services business and the purchase in 2010 of certain equipment that had been previously leased salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount depreciation expenses increased by 37 million primarily due to an increase in capitalized hardware and software to support investments in our infrastructure and the purchase in 2009 of a previously leased facility telecommunication expenses increased by 33 million primarily due to an increase in colocation expenses and additional circuits required to support the increase in our network infrastructure fees paid to icann increased by 30 million resulting from a fee increase in july 2009 

  

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decrease slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011 as our revenue grows faster than the related costs 

  

sales and marketing 

  

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as online television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 

 

   

2011 compared to 2010 sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and consulting expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses advertising and consulting expenses increased by 81 million primarily due to increases in product marketing initiatives promoting registry services salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 78 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount of our sales force and an increase in stockbased compensation expenses due to additional vested rsus granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the december 2010 and may 2011 special cash dividends allocated overhead expenses decreased by 31 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the sales and marketing function as a result of the divestiture of the authentication services business 

  

2010 compared to 2009 sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and consulting expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses advertising and consulting expenses increased by 64 million primarily due to certain corporate and registry services related advertising and marketing campaigns in 2010 salary and employee benefits expenses increased 63 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount of our sales force and other new products and services allocated overhead expenses decreased by 54 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the sales and marketing function as a result of divestitures in 2010 and 2009 

  

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011 as we realize a full year effect of increased headcount in our sales force and continued investments in certain marketing initiatives 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees facilities costs computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 

 

   

2011 compared to 2010 research and development expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in allocated overhead expenses and an increase in capitalized labor partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses and contract and professional services expenses allocated overhead expenses decreased by 34 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs capitalized labor increased by 13 million primarily due to an increase in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 25 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our dns infrastructure and new services contract and professional services expenses increased by 11 million in 2011 primarily due to an increased need for temporary staff 

  

  

  

2010 compared to 2009 research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses an increase in capitalized labor and a decrease in contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 95 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount primarily used to support the development of the dns infrastructure and the nia services business allocated overhead expenses decreased by 33 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs as a result of the divestitures in 2010 and 2009 capitalized labor increased by 24 million primarily due to an increase in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects contract and professional services expenses decreased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in the need for such external services and the increase in internal resources 

  

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2012 as compared to 2011 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel costs of facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

 

   

2011 compared to 2010 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses occupancy expenses miscellaneous general and administrative expenses depreciation expenses contract and professional services expenses telecommunication expenses and equipment and software expenses partially offset by a decrease in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 182 million primarily as a result of reduced corporate support functions needed subsequent to the divestiture of the authentication services business occupancy expenses decreased by 73 million primarily due to lower rent expenses as the lease for certain office buildings expired in 2010 miscellaneous general and administrative expenses decreased by 35 million primarily due to the release of 59 million of liabilities in 2011 related to nonincome tax expenses as a result of the lapse of the statutes of limitations partially offset by certain adjustments in 2010 for a release of an accrual for certain nonincome tax contingencies when the statute of limitations expired depreciation expenses decreased by 31 million primarily due to ceasing further depreciation on corporate assets held for sale in may 2010 the expenses of which were classified in continuing operations until the third quarter of 2010 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 30 million primarily due to costs in 2010 to support the divestiture of the authentication services business telecommunication expenses decreased by 16 million primarily due to lower shared costs included in continuing operations as a result of divestitures equipment and software expenses decreased by 16 million primarily due to lower shared software costs subsequent to the divestiture of the authentication services business overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by 121 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs 

  

2010 compared to 2009 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in contract and professional services expenses telecommunication expenses depreciation expenses miscellaneous general and administrative expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in 

  

corporate overhead expenses allocated to other cost types contract and professional services expenses decreased by 97 million primarily due to professional services costs incurred in 2009 for accounting and auditing services related to our divestiture strategy as well as a reduction in our need for such outside professional services telecommunication expenses decreased by 62 million primarily due to a reduction in circuits to support the business as a result of the divestitures and a onetime minimum commitment shortfall expense recorded in 2009 depreciation expenses decreased by 49 million primarily due to certain capital software projects becoming fully depreciated prior to 2010 and ceasing further depreciation on corporate assets held for sale in may 2010 the expenses of which were classified as continuing operations until the third quarter of 2010 miscellaneous general and administrative expenses decreased by 41 million primarily due to certain adjustments in 2010 for a release of an accrual for certain nonincome tax contingencies when the statute of limitations expired a refund of a previously expensed nonincome tax payment and an adjustment of certain expense accruals coupled with certain asset writeoffs during 2009 salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 40 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount primarily due to the divestitures in 2010 and 2009 and a reduction in the amount of overhead to support the business overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by 214 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and proportionately higher headcount in the general and administrative function as a result of the divestures in 2010 and 2009 

  

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease in 2012 as compared to 2011 as we realize a full year of postdivestiture cost reductions in our general and administrative function 

  

restructuring and impairment charges 

  

see note 6 “restructuring charges” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k additionally in 2009 we recorded an impairment charge of 97 million related to our name gtld intangible asset 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense consists of contractual interest payments on convertible debentures amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs on the liability component of our convertible debentures contingent interest payments to holders of our convertible debentures interest expenses related to our current 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our previous 5000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “2006 facility” offset by capitalized interest we terminated the 2006 facility in november 2010 

  

a comparison of interest expense is presented below 

 

   

the indenture governing the convertible debentures requires the payment of contingent interest to the holders of the convertible debentures if the board declares a dividend to our stockholders that is designated by the board as an extraordinary dividend the contingent interest is calculated as the amount derived by multiplying the per share declared dividend with the ifconverted number of shares applicable to the convertible 

  

  

  

debentures the board declared extraordinary dividends in april 2011 and december 2010 and consequently we paid 1000 million and 1091 million contingent interest respectively to holders of the convertible debentures the lower contingent interest payment in 2011 was the primary driver of the decrease in total interest expense from 2010 interest expense increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the contingent interest payment 

  

nonoperating income net 

  

nonoperating income net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities net gains or losses on the sale and impairment of investments net gains or losses on the divestiture of certain businesses unrealized gains and losses on the contingent interest derivative on the convertible debentures income from transition services agreements and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses 

  

a comparison of nonoperating income net is presented below 

 

   

2011 compared to 2010 nonoperating income net decreased by 92 million in 2011 interest and dividend income decreased primarily as a result of lower cash balances and investments in marketable securities in 2011 income from transition services agreements decreased primarily due to a decrease in transition services provided to support the sale of the authentication services business other net decreased primarily due to a 39 million outofperiod adjustment recorded in 2011 for certain nonincome taxes related to investments 

  

2010 compared to 2009 nonoperating income net increased in 2010 interest and dividend income increased primarily as a result of investing in 2010 in marketable securities which have higher interest rates as compared to money market funds and higher average cash balances as a result of the proceeds from the sale of the authentication services business income from transition services agreements increased primarily due to an increase in transition services provided to support certain divestitures in 2010 and 2009 realized net gain on investments increased primarily due to a 43 million realized gain in 2010 due to distributions received from certain investment funds that exceed their book value other net in 2010 includes 19 million in miscellaneous income partially offset by 29 million in foreign currency losses other net in 2009 primarily includes 33 million received from certicom corporation “certicom” due to the termination of the acquisition agreement entered into with certicom 

  

income tax expense 

  

see note 13 “income taxes” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

income from discontinued operations net of tax 

  

see note 4 “discontinued operations” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

   

as of december 31 2011 our principal source of liquidity was 13 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 329 million of marketable securities the marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities the cash equivalents consist mainly of time deposits and amounts deposited in money market funds as of december 31 2011 all marketable securities were invested in fixed income securities with maturities between one and three years our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible for additional information on our investment portfolio see note 2 “cash cash equivalents and marketable securities” of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

  

as of december 31 2011 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries was 11 billion our intent is to permanently reinvest outside of the us those funds held by foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the us currently we do not anticipate that we will need funds that were generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the us and if us tax has not already been previously provided we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds during 2011 we repatriated 864 million of funds that had been previously taxed in the us from our foreign subsidiaries 

  

in april 2011 we declared and in may 2011 paid a special cash dividend of 275 per share of our common stock totaling 4635 million as a result of the dividend we also paid 1000 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures in december 2010 we declared and paid a special dividend of 300 per share of our common stock totaling 5182 million as a result of the dividend we also paid 1091 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures 

  

in 2011 we repurchased approximately 163 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 3276 for an aggregate cost of 5346 million in 2010 we repurchased approximately 157 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 2793 for an aggregate cost of 4377 million in 2009 we repurchased approximately 113 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 2231 for an aggregate cost of 2528 million as of december 31 2011 8313 million remained available for further repurchases under the 2010 share buyback program 

  

in november 2011 we entered into a 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility we borrowed 1000 million from this facility during 2011 in connection with the purchase of our new corporate headquarters building in reston virginia for approximately 1185 million including 05 million of closing costs our credit facility is discussed in more detail in note 7 “debt and interest expense” 2011 credit facility  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

we purchased marketable securities of 790 million and received 5460 million from maturities and sales of marketable securities in 2011 we purchased marketable securities of 7877 million and received 2846 

  

  

  

million from maturities and sales of marketable securities in 2010 there were no purchases or sales of marketable securities in 2009 we received distributions aggregating to 252 million and 1295 million from certain investment funds in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

  

in summary our cash flows for 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows 

 

   

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes and facilities 

  

2011 compared to 2010 cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher income taxes payable in 2010 primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the authentication services business before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus and a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees the increase was offset by a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues due to the divestiture of the authentication services business in 2010 

  

2010 compared to 2009 cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues including decreased revenues from discontinued operations coupled with the timing of receipts from customers higher income taxes payable primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the authentication services business before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus and the payment of contingent interest on the convertible debentures the decrease is partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees primarily resulting from the completion of our divestitures in 2010 and 2009 and lower average headcount in 2010 an increase in interest income resulting from investments in higher interest rate marketable securities and an increase in income from transition services agreements primarily due to an increase in transition services provided to support certain divestitures in 2010 and 2009 

  

net cash provided by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to divestiture of businesses timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments and purchases of property and equipment 

  

2011 compared to 2010 the decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to proceeds received from the divestiture of businesses in 2010 and the purchase of our new corporate headquarters in reston virginia in 2011 partially offset by an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments and a decrease in purchases of marketable securities 

  

2010 compared to 2009 net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of businesses an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities and investments and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment the increase is partially offset by an increase in purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds received from sale of an office building in 2009 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings from our credit facility stock repurchases stock option exercises our employee stock purchase plan “espp” excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and dividend payments 

  

2011 compared to 2010 net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and a decrease in realized excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus the increase is partially offset by 1000 million borrowed under our credit facility in 2011 and a lower special dividend paid in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

2010 compared to 2009 net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to the payment of a special dividend in december 2010 and an increase in stock repurchases the increase is partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and the espp and an increase in realized carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus 

  

impact of inflation 

  

we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2012 are anticipated to be between 7 and 10 of revenue and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 

  

contractual obligations 

  

see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” leases and purchase obligations and contractual agreements of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

we enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business we also entered into indemnification agreements with symantec in connection with the sale of the authentication services business see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” indemnifications of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2011 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

stock options and restricted stock units 

  

grants of stockbased awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we 

  

  

  

recognize that these stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages as of december 31 2011 there are a total of 34 million of unvested rsus and outstanding stock options which represent potential dilution of 21 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all rsus vest and are settled as of december 31 2011 9 of our outstanding options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price there were no stock options granted in 2011 in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and rsu programs however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

the interest rates on our revolving credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2011 we had 1000 million outstanding under our credit facility the impact of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our interest expense in 2012 

  

our marketable securities consist of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk as of december 31 2011 we had 329 million of fixed income securities which consisted primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies the impact of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with both monetary and nonmonetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts which are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2011 we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 397 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and nonmonetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

  

market risk management 

  

the fair market value of our convertible debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as 

  

interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations as of december 31 2011 the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately 15 billion based on quoted market prices 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures

we are the exclusive registry of domain names within the com net and name generic toplevel domains “gtlds” under agreements with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers “icann” and the us department of commerce “doc” as a registry we maintain the master directory of all secondlevel domain names in these toplevel domains eg johndoecom and janedoenet these toplevel domains are supported by our global constellation of domain name servers in addition we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new secondlevel domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications transfers reregistrations and deletions for existing secondlevel domain names “shared registration system” 

  

separate from our agreements with icann we have agreements with others to be the exclusive registry for the tv and cc country code toplevel domains “cctlds” and we operate the backend registry systems for the jobs and edu gtlds these toplevel domains are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and shared registration system

domain names can be registered for between one and ten years and the fees charged for com and net may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with icann over the applicable term revenues for registrations of name are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those applicable to com and net however fees charged are subject to our agreement with icann over the applicable term revenues for cc and tv domain names are based on a similar fee system and registration system though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by icann the fees received from operating the jobs registry infrastructure are based on the terms of verisign’s agreement with the registry operator of jobs no fees are received from operating the edu registry infrastructure

during 2009 we completed the divestiture or windingdown of the following businesses 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

during 2008 we completed the divestiture of the following businesses 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

operations infrastructure 

  

our operations infrastructure consists of secure data centers in dulles virginia new castle delaware and fribourg switzerland most of these secure data centers operate on a 24hour a day every day basis supporting our business units and services the performance and scale of our infrastructure are critical for our naming services businesses and give us the platform to maintain our leadership position key features of our operations infrastructure include 

  

   

   

   

as part of our operations infrastructure for our registry services business we operate all authoritative domain name servers that answer domain name lookups for the com and net zones as well as for the other toplevel domains for which we are the registry we also operate two of the thirteen externally visible root zone 

  

server addresses including the “a” root which is considered to be the authoritative root zone server of the internet’s dns the domain name servers provide the associated name server and ip address for every com and net domain name on the internet and a large number of other toplevel domain queries resulting in an annual average of over 60 billion responses per day these name servers are located around the world providing local domain name service throughout north america south america europe and asia each server facility is a controlled and monitored environment incorporating security and system maintenance features this network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the internet’s dns infrastructure during the fourth quarter of 2010 we deployed domain name system security extensions in  net  allowing dns data in the  net domain to provide origin authentication of dns data authenticated denial of existence and data integrity 

  

in 2010 we announced an approximately 300 million new initiative called “project apollo” to meet infrastructure challenges expected over the next decade we expect that this initiative will strengthen scale and in some cases revamp the com infrastructure to repel significant ddos attacks and provide enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities we expect to grow capacity 1000 times todays level of 4 trillion queries to manage 4 quadrillion queries per day to support normal and peak attack volumes based on what we have experienced as well as internet attack trends in 2009 we completed the prior infrastructure initiative called “project titan” a threeyear largescale infrastructure upgrade that included the deployment of a new operations center as well as regional resolution sites of which we now have more than 50 globally 

  

call centers and help desk we provide customer support services through our phonebased call centers email help desks and webbased selfhelp systems our virginia call center is staffed 24 hours a day every day of the year to support our naming services businesses all call centers have a staff of trained customer support agents and provide webbased support services utilizing customized automatic response systems to provide selfhelp recommendations 

  

operations support and monitoring through our network operations centers we have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical database systems and our global resolution systems our distributed network operations centers are staffed 24 hours a day every day of the year 

  

disaster recovery plans we have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities our registry services business maintains dual mirrored data centers that allow rapid failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity our critical data services including domain name registration and global resolution use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as mirroring and remote replication 

  

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we market our registry services worldwide through registrars we market our nia services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including direct sales and indirect channels our direct sales and marketing organization as of december 31 2010 consisted of 133 employees we have marketing and sales offices throughout the world 

  

research and development 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had 272 employees dedicated to research and development we believe that timely development of new and enhanced internet security ecommerce information and technologies is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2010 2009 and 2008 our research and development expenses were 537 million 524 million and 618 million respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed 

  

  

  

technology from third parties although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally or acquired through business acquisitions 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in each of the registry services and nia services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

  

competition in registry services 

  

we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum and coop gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 15 registries for the operation of 17 gtlds in addition there are over 240 latin script cctld registries and 16 internationalized domain name country code toplevel domain “idn cctld” registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited and nominet uk inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and phone applications 

  

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann these include internationalized domain name toplevel domains “idn tlds” and the upcoming introduction of new gtlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds and such new idn cctlds have started to be introduced into the root other new domain extensions including ones for which we could apply could become available by the end of 2012 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business applicants for such new tlds may have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do furthermore icann has proposed allowing the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise affiliated with a registrar whereas verisign is currently prohibited by its agreements with icann and the department of commerce from owning more than 15 of a registrar as a result operators of new gtlds may be able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration while we may apply for one or more of these new domain extensions there is no certainty that we will ultimately be successful and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our competitors 

  

competition in network intelligence and availability services 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly 

  

than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully 

  

we face competition in the nia services industry from companies such as isight partners security services xforce threat analysis service secunia aps secureworks inc mcafee inc prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc’s dynect platform neustar ultra services opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc and afilias limited 

  

industry regulation 

  

registry services within the us government oversight of internet administration is provided by the doc effective october 1 2009 the doc and icann entered into a new agreement known as the “affirmation of commitments” which replaced a prior agreement known as the joint project agreement under the affirmation of commitments the doc became one of several parties working together with other representative constituency members in providing an ongoing review of icann’s performance and accountability the affirmation of commitments provides for more defined international participation in this review the agreement sets forth periodic reviews by committees these review panels are charged with reviewing and making recommendations regarding i the accountability and transparency of icann ii the security stability and resiliency of the dns iii the impact of new gtlds on competition consumer trust and consumer choice and iv the effectiveness of icann’s policies with respect to registrant data in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust under the affirmation of commitments the assistant secretary of communications and information of the doc will be a member of the “accountability and transparency” review panel the reviews generally are to occur no less than every three to four years 

  

as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com  net and name gtlds we have entered into certain agreements with icann and the doc 

  

com registry agreement on november 29 2006 the doc approved the registry agreement between icann and verisign for the com gtld the “ com registry agreement” the com registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com toplevel domain through november 30 2012 the com registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed for successive terms unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the com registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach the doc shall approve such renewal if it concludes that approval will serve the public interest in a the continued security and stability of the internet dns and the operation of the com registry including in addition to other relevant factors consideration of verisign’s compliance with consensus policies and technical specifications its service level agreements as set forth in the com registry agreement and the investment associated with improving the security and stability of the dns and b the provision of registry services as defined in the com registry agreement at reasonable prices terms and conditions the parties have an expectancy of renewal of the com registry agreement so long as the foregoing public interest standard is met and verisign is not in breach of the com registry agreement 

  

we are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies as well as other provisions pursuant to the com registry agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations the com registry agreement also provides a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve additional registry services 

  

cooperative agreement in connection with the doc’s approval of the com registry agreement verisign and the doc entered into amendment no thirty 30 to their cooperative agreement—special awards conditions ncr9218742 the “amendment” regarding operation of the com registry which extends the term of cooperative agreement through november 30 2012 and provides that any renewal or extension of the com 

  

  

  

registry agreement is subject to prior written approval by the doc as described above the amendment provides that the doc shall approve such renewal if it concludes that it is in the public interest and in the continued security and stability of the dns and that the provision of com registry services is offered on reasonable terms 

  

the descriptions of the com registry agreement and the amendment are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are incorporated by reference as exhibits in this form 10k 

  

net registry agreement on july 1 2005 we entered into a registry agreement with icann for the net gtld the “ net registry agreement” the net registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the net toplevel domain through june 30 2011 the net registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the net registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach 

  

name registry agreement on october 1 2008 we acquired the global name registry ltd “gnr” the holder of the name registry agreement which provides that gnr will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the name toplevel domain through august 15 2012 the renewal provisions are the same as for the net registry agreement 

  

some of the services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable us export law as the list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or changes government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals or we violate applicable laws we may not be able to provide some of our services in international markets and may be subject to fines and other penalties 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the us and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for the verisign mark in the us and other countries and have filed new trademark applications for the new verisign logo in the same countries we have common law rights in many other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services 

  

with regard to our naming services businesses our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our naming services businesses and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses including the conversion of idns we own our proprietary shared registration system through which competing registrars submit secondlevel domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate as well as the atlas distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors 

  

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business which closed on august 9 2010 the “closing date” symantec acquired all trademarks primarily used in our authentication services business including our checkmark logo and the geotrust and thawte brand names and we granted symantec a fiveyear license in connection with the verisigncom website the verisigncom website will be operated by symantec for a period of five years following the closing date subject to certain rights of verisign including the right to include links to subdomains operated us 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount by function including historical headcount associated with the divested and wounddown businesses 

  

   

we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our operating results may continue to be adversely affected as a result of the sluggish economic recovery unfavorable market and economic social and political conditions 

  

an unstable global economic social and political environment may have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations the economic social and political environment has or may negatively impact among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to the extent that the economic social and political environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may further negatively impact our business if the economic social political and market conditions in the us and globally do not improve or if they further deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial position as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

  

we may experience significant fluctuations in our financial results 

  

the successful operation of our business depends on numerous factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

issues arising from our agreements with icann and the doc could harm our registry services business 

  

we are parties to agreements i with the doc with respect to certain aspects of the dns ii with icann and the doc as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com gtld and iii with icann with respect to being the exclusive registry for the net and name gtlds 

  

we face risks arising from our agreements with icann and the doc including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition under the  com   net and  name registry agreements we are prohibited from holding a greater than 15 ownership interest in any icann accredited registrar this prohibition on crossownership currently applies to all seventeen icann gtlds but does not apply to cctlds icann has proposed allowing the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise be affiliated with a registrar if this proposal is adopted the impact to the distribution channel is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

challenges to internet administration could harm our registry services business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including governmental authorities in the us and other countries to our role in the ongoing operation of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other risks it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our registry services business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted which may not also apply to our competitors 

  

our international operations subject our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had 167 or 16 of our employees outside the us expansion into international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international markets or expand our presence in existing markets failure to do so could harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

   

   

   

we are exposed to risks faced by financial institutions 

  

we have entered into hedging transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry which have been adversely impacted by the current economic environment defaults by and even rumors or questions about the solvency of certain financial institutions and the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions the hedging transactions we have entered into expose us to credit risk in the event of default by one of our counterparties despite the risk control measures we have in place a default by one of our counterparties or liquidity problems in the financial services industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our marketable securities portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had 21 billion in cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash of which 5012 million was invested in marketable securities the marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies corporate debt securities and debt securities issued by foreign governments meeting the criteria of our investment policy which is focused on the preservation of our capital through the investment in investment grade securities we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile 

  

these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the eurozone crisis which has affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues over the past several years the volatility and disruption in the global credit market reached unprecedented levels if the global credit market does not improve or deteriorates further our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results 

  

governmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business create potential liability and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

application of new and existing laws and regulations to the internet and communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

  

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and our ability to conduct business in certain foreign countries for example laws designed to restrict who can register domain names the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling counterfeit goods and cyber squatting laws designed to require registrants to provide additional documentation or information in connection with domain name registrations and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities we have a number of contracts pursuant to which we provide services to the us government and even though these contracts are immaterial they impose compliance costs including compliance with the federal acquisition regulation that could be significant to the company 

  

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us affect our reputation force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business in addition any such new laws could impede growth of or result in a decline in domain name registrations as well as impact the demand for our services 

  

we may be exposed to potential risks if we were to determine we do not have an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting 

  

as a public company the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

as a result of the transitioning of key corporate functions to our dulles virginia office and potential voluntary employee attrition there is an increased risk of our failing to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial procedures including satisfaction of the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although we believe that we have adequately planned to address this risk despite our efforts if we were to fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results or adequately identify and reduce fraud as a result the financial position of the company could be harmed and current and potential future stockholders could lose confidence in us andor our reported financial results which may cause a negative effect on our stock price and we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings which may be costly or divert management attention 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the thirteen root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a nonregulated basis root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and data needed to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the toplevel domains these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet consequently our registry services business could be harmed if these independent operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our registry services business could be harmed if any of the independent operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls 

  

changes in customer behavior either as a result of evolving technologies or user practices may impact the demand for domain names 

  

currently internet users navigate to a website either by directly typing its domain name into a web browser or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet search engines changed the value of their algorithms on the use of a domain for finding a website iii internet users were to shift away from direct navigation iv internet users were to increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content or v internet users were to increase the use of second or third level domains or alternate identifiers such as social networking sites in each case the demand for domain names could decrease 

  

changes in the level of spending on online advertising andor the way that online networks compensate owners of websites could impact the demand for domain names 

  

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and 

  

  

  

metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google and yahoo could adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants resulting in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

if we encounter system interruptions we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in new castle delaware dulles virginia and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to secondary or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from terrorism 

  

in addition our registry services business and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past 

  

a failure in the operation of our toplevel domain name zone servers the domain name root zone servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time in the event that a registrar has not implemented back up services recommended by us in conformance with industry best practices a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or 

  

update of the master database that we maintain could also result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure the shared registration system the domain name root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware and software to our registry services operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for certain of our businesses such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our business would suffer if we lost the rights to use certain of these technologies additionally another party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could harm our business 

  

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business 

  

  

  

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

  

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties the international launch of the new logo for the company could present additional potential risks for third party claims of infringement any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays in our business activities generally or require us to develop a noninfringing logo or technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement was made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not identify and adopt an alternative noninfringing logo develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

  

we are involved in a number of claims lawsuits and investigations against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

in addition to possible intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are involved in a number of claims lawsuits and investigations which we currently believe are immaterial but could prove material litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur in addition certain parties to litigation to which we are a party may be entitled to indemnification by us adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims lawsuits and investigations may result in significant monetary damages including indemnification payments or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additionally these investigations claims and lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic channel and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts including in international markets we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our services than we would otherwise 

  

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

  

furthermore any changes by our distributors to their existing marketing strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if one or more of our distributors were to encounter financial difficulties or if there were a significant reduction in marketing expenditures by our distributors including registrars as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on our business including a decrease in domain name registrations and renewals failure of one or more of our strategic channel or other relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

the success of our nia services depend in part on the acceptance of our services 

  

we are investing in our nia services and the future growth of these services depends in part on the commercial success acceptance and reliability of our nia services these services will suffer if our target customers do not adopt or use these services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our nia services or continue to use these services even after adoption 

  

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

  

our registry services and nia services businesses are developing services in emerging markets including services that involve naming and directory services other than registry and related infrastructure services these emerging markets are rapidly evolving may never gain wide acceptance and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services in these markets include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

  

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success also depends on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad 

  

all of the members of our senior management team and other us key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our senior management team members or key employees the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors “board” these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

  

  

   

   

verisign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control or the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock and may make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan 

  

   

   

   

in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board 

  

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business as well as in the execution of our divestitures there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

  

our inability to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

risks relating to the competitive environment in which we operate 

  

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

  

general new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

competition in registry services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum and coop gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 15 registries for the operation of 17 gtlds in addition there are over 240 latin script cctld registries and 16 idn cctld registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolution and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited and nominet uk inc in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc furthermore to the extent endusers increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content we may face competition from providers of such web and phone applications 

  

additional competition to our business may arise from the introduction of new tlds by icann these include idn tlds and the upcoming introduction of new gtlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for the awarding of new idn cctlds and such new idn cctlds have started to be introduced into the root other new domain extensions including ones for which we could apply could become available by the end of 2012 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business applicants for such new tlds may have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do furthermore icann has proposed allowing the operators of new gtlds to also own be owned 100 by or otherwise affiliated with a registrar whereas verisign is currently prohibited by its agreements with icann and the department of commerce from owning more than 15 of a registrar as a result operators of new gtlds may be able to obtain competitive advantages through such vertical integration while we may apply for one or more of these new domain extensions there is no certainty that we will ultimately be successful and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our competitors 

  

competition in network intelligence and availability services several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully 

  

  

  

we face competition in the network intelligence and availability services industry from companies such as isight partners security services xforce threat analysis service secunia aps secureworks inc mcafee inc prolexic technologies inc att inc verizon communications inc dyn inc’s dynect platform neustar ultra services opendns bluecat networks inc infoblox inc nominum inc and afilias limited 

  

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

  

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings in order to remain competitive and retain our market share we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and customer preferences or launch entirely new products and services in anticipation of market trends we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost effective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

  

risks related to the sale of our authentication services business and the completion of our divestiture plan 

  

our suite of products and services is less diverse following the sale of our authentication services business 

  

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expected from the sale of our authentication services business following the sale of the authentication services business our registry services business which derives most of its revenues from registration fees for domain names generates substantially all of our revenue if there is a disruption in the registry services business including any disruption from changes in the domain name industry changes in or challenges to our agreements with icann including any changes resulting from legal challenges to these agreements from the coalition for icann transparency inc “cfit” or otherwise changes in customer preferences a downturn in the economy or changes in technology related to the use of domain names there may be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition a failure of either or both of the com or net registry agreements to renew on the same or similar terms when they expire in 2011  net  and 2012  com  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we face risks related to the terms of the sale of the authentication services business 

  

under the agreement reached with symantec for the sale of our authentication services business the “symantec agreement” we agreed to several terms that may pose risks to us including the potential for confusion by the public with respect to symantec’s right to use certain of our trademarks brand and website as well as the risk that current or potential investors in the company or customers may incorrectly attribute to verisign problems with symantec products or services that are currently operated under the verisign brand pursuant to licensing agreements with symantec this may have a negative impact on our reputation our brand and the market for our products and services we are at risk that we will be unable to register build equity in or enforce the new logo for the company in addition we may determine that certain assets transferred to symantec could have been useful in our naming services businesses or in other future endeavors requiring us to forego future opportunities or design or purchase alternatives which could be costly and less effective than the transferred assets 

  

under the terms of the symantec agreement we have licensed rights to certain of our websites and domain name registrations to symantec we are at risk that our customers will go to the licensed websites and be unable to locate our nia services in addition we will continue to maintain the registration rights for the domain names licensed to symantec for which symantec has sole control over the content and we may be subject to claims of infringement if symantec posts content that is alleged to infringe the rights of a third party we may also face expenditures to procure registration rights to other domain names for our naming services many of which may be owned by third parties 

  

we are at risk of increased levels of employee attrition following the sale of our authentication services business 

  

although we believe that we have retained sufficient senior management and other employees to perform various functions at the company we are at risk of experiencing increased levels of employee attrition from employees scheduled to be transitioned out of the company now that the sale of the authentication services business has closed and we may encounter difficulty recruiting and hiring competent personnel to replace any key personnel who voluntarily terminate their employment with us if we are unable to replace employees quickly we may be forced to hire temporary labor for assistance in the short term at higher rates than the salaried employees in addition it may take new personnel a significant period of time to understand and become familiar with company processes the failure to replace our departing personnel if any in a timely manner could result in our inability to perform various important functions including completing our sec filings and could impair our ability to execute our business strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we are transitioning key corporate functions from our california office to our virginia office 

  

we may encounter difficulties and face risks as we transition key corporate functions from our mountain view california office to our dulles virginia office including our ability to timely complete our financial reporting the impact on key corporate support functions and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in addition the large number of personnel displacements could impair employee morale and create a distraction for employees which could harm our business 

  

we continue to be responsible for certain liabilities and transition services following the divestiture of certain businesses 

  

under the agreements reached with the buyers of certain divested businesses including the authentication services business we remain liable for certain liabilities related to the divested businesses in addition we have entered into and may in the future amend or extend transition services agreements with buyers in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses including the authentication services business these transition services may be required for a longer period of time than anticipated by management in addition we have agreed to perform certain transition services for a fixed price or for fixed hourly rates but our actual costs to provide such services may exceed the fees buyers are contractually obligated to pay us under the relevant transition services agreements the scope and magnitude of the transition services we have agreed to provide in connection with the sale of the authentication services business are greater than those provided under our divestiture plan and we may face challenges performing such transition services including that the focus of employees and resources supporting the transition services may impact their ability to support our existing businesses 

  

there is a possibility that we will incur unanticipated costs and expenses associated with management of liabilities relating to the businesses we have divested including requests for indemnification by the buyers of the divested businesses these liabilities could potentially relate to i breaches of contractual representations and warranties we gave to the buyers of the divested businesses or ii certain liabilities relating to the divested businesses which we retained under the agreements reached with the buyers of the divested businesses such liabilities could include certain litigation matters including actions brought by third parties where responsibility for such liabilities is to be contractually allocated to the buyer or shared with the buyer or another party it is possible that the buyer or the other party may be in default for payments for which they are responsible obligating us to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of those obligations 

  

following the divestiture of certain businesses our ability to compete in certain market sectors is restricted 

  

under the agreements reached with buyers for certain businesses we divested including the authentication services business we are restricted from competing either directly or indirectly with those businesses or from entering certain market sectors for a defined period of time pursuant to negotiated noncompete arrangements 

  

  

  

risks related to our securities 

  

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1727 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 235 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 the “convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

  

we may not have the ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of convertible debentures as required by the indenture governing the convertible debentures 

  

as a result of the sale of the convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of long term debt outstanding holders of our outstanding convertible debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase the convertible debentures upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture dated as of august 20 2007 the “indenture” between the company and us bank national association as trustee although we currently intend to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash as required under the indenture we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all in addition upon conversion of the convertible debentures we will be required to make cash payments to the holders of the convertible debentures equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the convertible debentures being converted and the conversion value as defined in the indenture of those debentures such payments could be significant and we may not have sufficient funds to make them at such time our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could also adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities 

  

a fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under or result in the acceleration of the maturity of our thenexisting indebtedness our ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or make any other required payments may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time our failure to repurchase the convertible debentures or pay cash in respect of conversions when required would result in an event of default with respect to the convertible debentures 

  

while we currently have the intent and ability to settle the principal in cash if we conclude that we no longer have the ability in the future we will be required to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the ifconverted method 

  

there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements could when adopted require us to implement different accounting methods which could have a material adverse impact on future or past results of operations which could in turn materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

in connection with the sale of the authentication services business to symantec the company has agreed to indemnify symantec for certain potential legal claims arising from the operation of the authentication services business for a period of sixty months after the closing of the sale transaction the company’s indemnification obligations in this regard are triggered only when indemnifiable claims exceed in the aggregate 4 million thereafter the company is obligated to indemnify symantec for 50 of all indemnifiable claims the company’s maximum indemnification obligation with respect to these claims is capped at 125 million 

  

while certain matters to which the company is a party specify the damages claimed such claims may not represent reasonably possible losses given the inherent uncertainties of the litigation the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time nor can the amount of possible loss or range of loss if any be reasonably estimated except in circumstances where an aggregate litigation accrual has been recorded for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

  

verisign is involved in various other investigations claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business none of which in its opinion will have a material effect on its business the company cannot assure you that it will prevail in any litigation regardless of the outcome any litigation may require the company to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention

overview 

  

we are a provider of internet infrastructure services by leveraging our global infrastructure we provide network confidence and availability for missioncritical internet services such as domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services our service capabilities enable domain name registration through our registrar partners and provide network availability for registrars and internet users alike 

  

as a result of the sale of the authentication services business included in the former internet infrastructure and identity services segment ceasing operations of the cps business and the divestiture of legacy products and services comprising the former other services segment our only reportable segment is now naming services which consists of registry services and nia services 

  

registry services operates the authoritative directory of all com net cc tv and name domain names and the backend systems for all jobs and edu domain names as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 1052 million domain names registered under the com and net registries our principal registries the number of domain names registered is largely driven by internet usage and broadband penetration rates as well as advertising and marketing activities carried out by us and thirdparty registrars although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in mature markets such as the us growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us over the longterm 

  

nia services provides infrastructure assurance to organizations and is comprised of verisign idefense security intelligence services managed domain name system services and distributed denial of service mitigation revenues from nia services are not significant

divestiture transactions 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2007 we announced a change to our business strategy to allow management to focus its attention on our core competencies and to make additional resources available to invest in our core businesses the strategy called for the divestiture or windingdown of our noncore businesses the divestiture strategy is now complete with the winddown of our cps business 

  

the following presents a summary of our divested and wounddown businesses during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 current and historical results of operations of the divested and wounddown businesses have been classified as discontinued operations unless otherwise noted

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on our judgment and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions however at times we enter into nonstandard arrangements including multipleelement arrangements as a result judgments are used to evaluate 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements 3 when to recognize revenue on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 

  

valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets 

  

goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired fair value determination of acquired net assets especially intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgment these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience 

  

  

  

market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected customer retention rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator c unanticipated competition d loss of key personnel e a morelikelythannot expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof f testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit or g recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit judgment is required in determining the existence of these factors and their effect on any impairment determination 

  

the fair value of our reporting units is determined considering the income the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business the transaction approach is a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on market prices on actual transactions and asking prices for businesses currently available for sale 

  

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows operating trends discount rates control premiums and other variables of these businesses although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 

  

given the significant excess of fair value over our reporting units’ carrying value the goodwill valuations were not overly sensitive to valuation methodologies or assumptions further a hypothetical change of 10 in the fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in goodwill impairments as of december 31 2010 

  

our other longlived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and purchased intangible assets we review other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount such events or circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

  

recoverability of other longlived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows of the group containing the asset if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

restructuring charges 

  

we have initiated restructuring plans including workforce reductions involving employee severance benefits and abandonment of excess facilities accounting for severance costs requires identifying whether the costs are associated with an ongoing arrangement or are considered a onetime benefit severance costs associated with an ongoing arrangement are recorded once the costs are determined to be both probable and 

  

estimable severance costs that are considered a onetime benefit are measured at fair value and are recognized upfront or over the future service period depending on whether future service is required if certain conditions are met including i management’s commitment to a detailed plan of termination that identifies the number of employees their job classifications or functions and their locations and expected completion date and ii the plan has been communicated to the employees determining the appropriate accounting model to use and estimating the fair value and the future service period requires judgment and could differ materially from actual experience and would require us to change our estimates as necessary with cumulative catchup adjustments in the period of change excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of the future lease obligations of the abandoned space including the potential for sublease income estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates changing market conditions by location and considerable work with thirdparty leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis as necessary 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative to be accounted for separately at fair value and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on simulations of stock prices interest rates credit ratings and bond prices to estimate the value of the derivative the significant inputs to the model include risk adjusted interest rates volatility and average yield curve observations and stock price several significant inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares which contain a service andor performance condition the determination of the fair value of stockbased awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a few complex and subjective variables primarily expected stock price volatility and expected term of the awards 

  

expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the expected term of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to postvesting exercise andor cancellations 

  

we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant for restricted stock units stock options and employee stock purchase plan offerings and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and record stockbased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 

  

we use the montecarlo simulation optionpricing model to determine the fair value of awards with marketconditions the montecarlo simulation optionpricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the blackscholes model however it also further incorporates into the fair value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 

  

if factors change and as a result we employ different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods the stockbased compensation expense we record for such future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our results of operations 

  

  

  

litigation and contingencies 

  

accruals for loss contingencies are based on management’s judgment as to the amount of loss to be incurred an accrual can be recorded when the event causing the loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated these accruals are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment which could differ from actual results thereby requiring us to record additional accruals or reverse a portion of such accruals 

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

  

deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon we consider the following matters among others in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth selected information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 

  

   

revenues 

  

revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the com net cc tv   name and jobs domain name registries revenues from cc tv name and jobs are not significant for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee from thirdparty registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann individual customers called registrants contract directly with thirdparty registrars or their resellers and the thirdparty registrars in turn register the com  net  cc  tv  name and jobs domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by increases in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations in each case as impacted by continued internet growth promotional marketing programs marketing expenditure by thirdparty registrars as well as fee increases as permitted under our agreements with icann on july 1 2010 we increased our com domain name registration fees by 7 from 686 to 734 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for com domain name registrations by up to 7 either in 2011 or in 2012 prior to the end of the current agreement with icann on november 30 2012 on july 1 2010 we increased our net domain name registration fees by 10 from 423 to 465 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations by up to 10 in 2011 prior to the end of the current agreement with icann on june 30 2011 we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate we are largely insulated from the risk posed by fluctuations in exchange rates due to the fact that all revenues paid to us for com and net registrations are in us dollars revenues from nia services are not significant 

  

  

  

a comparison of revenues is presented below 

  

   

the following table compares domain names ending in com and net managed by our registry services business 

  

   

our revenues increased by 646 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a 9 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and increases in our com and net registry fees in october 2008 and july 2010 as per our agreements with icann partially offset by a 76 million decrease in revenues because of a onetime project completed in 2009 our revenues increased by 570 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a 7 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and an increase in our com and net registry fees in october 2008 partially offset by 99 million decrease because of revenues in 2008 from legacy services which were divested in 2008 

  

the growth in the number of active domain names was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs we expect to see continued growth in the number of active domain names in 2011 as a result of further internet growth in addition we expect to see continued growth internationally in both com and net domain name bases especially in markets that we have targeted through our marketing programs we expect revenues to increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 as a result of continued growth in the number of active domain names ending in com and net and implementation of the fee increase which became effective in july 2010 as domain names are up for renewal at the increased price 

  

new tlds including new idn tlds cctlds and gtlds may be introduced by icann in 2011 andor 2012 we cannot assess the impact if any the introduction of these new tlds will have on our revenues and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors— the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share ” of this form 10k  

  

geographic revenues 

  

we operate in the us australia china india and other asia pacific countries “apac” europe the middle east and africa “emea” and certain other countries including canada and latin american countries 

  

a comparison of our geographic revenues is presented below 

  

   

revenues are generally attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our customers are located 

  

revenues from each of the respective regions increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily driven by an increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and an increase in our com and net registry fees in july 2010 and october 2008 2009 us revenues include 76 million from a onetime project 

  

revenues from each of the respective regions increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily driven by an increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and an increase in our com and net registry fees in october 2008 2009 and 2008 us revenues include 76 million and 59 million respectively from a onetime project 

  

mature markets such as the us where broadband and ecommerce have seen strong market penetration are expected to see decreasing incremental growth rates reflecting the maturing of the markets we expect to see larger increases in certain international regions resulting from greater broadband and internet penetration and expanding ecommerce as electronic means of payments are increasingly adopted 

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel that manage the operational systems depreciation expenses operational costs associated with the delivery of our services fees paid to icann customer support and training consulting and development services costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  

   

2010 compared to 2009 cost of revenues decreased primarily due to decreases in allocated overhead expenses expenses related to a onetime revenue project occupancy expenses contract and professional services expenses and equipment and software expenses partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses depreciation expenses telecommunication expenses and fees paid to icann allocated overhead expenses decreased by 142 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the cost of revenues function as a result of the divestitures in 2010 and 2009 expenses related to a onetime revenue project that was completed in 2009 decreased by 45 million occupancy expenses decreased by 24 million primarily due to the purchase in december 2009 of a previously leased facility management costsaving initiatives to reduce overall utility expenses and the elimination of certain shared services utility expenses as a result of the sale of the authentication services business contract and professional services expenses decreased by 18 million primarily due to a decrease in the need for such external services and the increase in internal resources equipment and software expenses decreased by 12 million primarily due to a decrease in equipment and software maintenance contracts required to support the business as a result of the sale of the authentication services business and the purchase in 2010 of certain equipments that were previously leased salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 42 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount depreciation expenses increased by 37 million primarily due to an increase in capitalized hardware and software to support investments in our infrastructure and the purchase in 2009 of a previously leased facility telecommunication expenses increased by 33 million primarily due to an increase in colocation expenses and additional circuits required to support the increase in our network infrastructure fees paid to icann increased by 30 million resulting from a fee increase in july 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in depreciation expenses fees paid to icann and telecommunication expenses offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses and expenses related to a 

  

  

  

onetime revenue project depreciation expenses increased by 107 million primarily due to increase in capitalized hardware and software to support investments in our infrastructure fees paid to icann increased by 50 million resulting from a fee increase in july 2009 telecommunication expenses increased by 28 million primarily due to an increase in colocation expenses and additional circuits required to support the increase in our network infrastructure allocated overhead expenses decreased by 68 million primarily due to a decrease in proportional headcount within the cost of revenues function as a result of the divestitures in 2009 and 2008 the divested businesses had a higher proportional headcount in cost of revenues contract and professional services expenses decreased by 44 million primarily due to a decrease in the need for such external services and the increase in internal resources salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 18 million primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense and stockbased compensation expenses expenses related to a onetime revenue project that was completed in 2009 decreased by 18 million 

  

we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2011 as compared to 2010 

  

sales and marketing 

  

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as the internet television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 

  

   

2010 compared to 2009 sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising marketing and consulting expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses advertising marketing and consulting expenses increased by 64 million primarily due to certain corporate and registry services related advertising and marketing campaigns in 2010 salary and employee benefits expenses increased 63 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the nia services business and other new products and services allocated overhead expenses decreased by 54 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the sales and marketing function as a result of divestitures in 2010 and 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses and travel expenses partially offset by increases in allocated overhead expenses and advertising marketing and consulting expenses salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 137 million primarily due to lower average headcount resulting from the 2008 restructuring plan travel expenses decreased by 28 million primarily due to lower average headcount and management’s costsavings initiatives allocated overhead expenses increased by 50 million primarily due to an increase in proportional headcount within the sales and marketing function as a result of the divestitures in 2009 and 2008 advertising marketing and consulting expenses increased by 47 million primarily due to international marketing initiatives and other efforts to increase the market penetration of our registry services business in 2009 

  

we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase slightly in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of investments in our nia sales force and certain marketing initiatives 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees the cost of facilities computer and communications equipment support services used in our service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of research and development expenses is presented below 

  

   

2010 compared to 2009 research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses an increase in capitalized labor and a decrease in contract and professional services expenses salary and employee benefits expenses increased by 95 million primarily due to an increase in average headcount primarily used to support the development of the dns infrastructure and the nia services business allocated overhead expenses decreased by 33 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs as a result of the divestitures in 2010 and 2009 capitalized labor increased by 24 million primarily due to an increase in internally developed software projects contract and professional services expenses decreased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in the need for such external services and the increase in internal resources 

  

2009 compared to 2008 research and development expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in depreciation expenses salary and employee benefits expenses and contract and professional services expenses partially offset by an increase in allocated overhead expenses depreciation expenses decreased by 48 million primarily due to a reduction in capitalized assets depreciated to research and development expenses in 2009 salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 31 million primarily due to lower average headcount resulting from the 2008 restructuring plan contract and professional services expenses decreased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in the services of outside contractors due to management’s costsavings initiatives and need for such external services and the increase in internal resources allocated overhead expenses increased by 24 million primarily due to an increase in proportional headcount within the research and development function as a result of the divestitures in 2009 and 2008 

  

we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2011 as compared to 2010 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

  

   

  

  

2010 compared to 2009 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in contract and professional services expenses telecommunication expenses depreciation expenses miscellaneous general and administrative expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses partially offset by a decrease in corporate overhead expenses allocated to other cost types contract and professional services expenses decreased by 97 million primarily due to professional services costs incurred in 2009 for accounting and auditing services related to our divestiture strategy as well as a reduction in our need for such outside professional services telecommunication expenses decreased by 62 million primarily due to a reduction in circuits to support the business as a result of the divestitures and a onetime minimum commitment shortfall expense recorded in 2009 depreciation expenses decreased by 49 million primarily due to certain capital software projects becoming fully depreciated prior to 2010 and ceasing further depreciation on corporate assets held for sale in may 2010 the results of operations of which were classified as continuing operations until the third quarter of 2010 miscellaneous general and administrative expenses decreased by 41 million primarily due to certain adjustments in 2010 for a release of an accrual for certain nonincome tax contingencies when the statute of limitations expired a refund of a previously expensed nonincome tax payment and an adjustment of certain expense accruals coupled with certain asset writeoffs during 2009 salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 40 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount primarily due to the divestitures in 2010 and 2009 and a reduction in the amount of overhead to support the business overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by 214 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and proportionately higher headcount in the general and administrative function as a result of the divestures in 2010 and 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses depreciation expenses contract and professional services expenses travel expenses and telecommunication expenses partially offset by increases in legal expenses and occupancy expenses salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by 178 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount which resulted from the divestitures in 2009 and 2008 and the 2008 restructuring plan depreciation expenses decreased by 63 million primarily due to a decrease in capitalized assets supporting our continuing operations and a reduction of facility related depreciation expenses caused by the sale of certain office buildings in 2008 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 53 million primarily due to a decrease in professional services costs incurred for accounting and auditing services related to our divestitures which were substantially completed during 2009 travel expenses decreased by 20 million primarily due to management’s costsaving initiatives telecommunication expenses decreased by 18 million primarily due to a reduction in circuits required to support the business as a result of the divestitures in 2009 and 2008 legal expenses increased by 52 million primarily due to the reversal in 2008 of certain previously accrued estimated litigation settlement costs in excess of actual final outcome occupancy expenses increased by 27 million primarily due to the sale and leaseback of certain office buildings in 2008 

  

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease in 2011 as compared to 2010 as we continue to realize postdivestiture cost reductions in our general and administrative function 

  

restructuring charges 

  

the following table presents the nature of restructuring charges 

  

   

2010 restructuring plan 

  

in connection with the sale of the authentication services business and the migration of our corporate functions from our mountain view facility to our facility in dulles virginia we initiated a restructuring plan in 2010 including workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities and other exit costs the “2010 restructuring plan” 

  

under the 2010 restructuring plan we will incur total estimated pretax cash charges of 224 million in severance costs and other related employee termination costs through december 31 2010 we recorded a total of 197 million in cash restructuring charges inclusive of amounts for discontinued operations under our 2010 restructuring plan related to employee terminations we expect to recognize excess facility exit costs of 137 million additionally we recognized stockbased compensation expenses of 105 million inclusive of amounts for discontinued operations in 2010 upon acceleration of stockbased awards for employees notified of termination and expect to recognize further expenses for employees to be terminated in the future however at this time we are not able in good faith to make a determination of the estimated amount or range of amounts thereon we expect to recognize all remaining cash and stockbased restructuring charges over the next several quarters through the end of fiscal 2011 

  

2008 restructuring plan 

  

as part of its divestiture strategy announced in 2007 we had initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of 2008 the “2008 restructuring plan” including workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities and other exit costs through december 31 2010 we recorded a total of 873 million in restructuring charges inclusive of amounts for discontinued operations under its 2008 restructuring plan the 2008 restructuring plan was substantially completed as of june 30 2010 

  

impairments and other charges 

  

impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

in 2009 we recorded an impairment charge of 97 million related to our name gtld intangible asset in continuing operations included in restructuring impairment and other charges in 2008 we recorded impairment charges of 776 million for goodwill related to our verisign japan reporting unit and 458 million for goodwill related to our former postpay reporting unit both of which are included in discontinued operations 

  

other charges 

  

in 2008 we recorded a loss of 791 million as a result of the sale of a portion of our mountain view facilities included in restructuring impairment and other charges 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense consists of contractual interest payments amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs on the liability component of our convertible debentures contingent interest payments to holders of our convertible debentures and other interest expenses primarily related to our 5000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “facility” offset by capitalized interest we terminated the facility in november 2010 

  

  

  

a comparison of interest expense is presented below 

  

  

   

interest expense increased in 2010 primarily due to a 1091 million contingent interest payment to holders of our convertible debentures 

  

nonoperating income net 

  

nonoperating income net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities net gains or losses on the sale and impairment of investments net gains or losses on the divestiture of certain businesses realized and unrealized gains and losses on the contingent interest derivative on the convertible debentures income from transition services agreements and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses 

  

a comparison of nonoperating income net is presented below 

  

   

2010 compared to 2009 nonoperating income net increased in 2010 interest and dividend income increased primarily as a result of investing in 2010 in marketable securities which have higher interest rates as compared to money market funds and higher average cash balances as a result of the proceeds from the sale of the authentication services business income from transition services agreements increased primarily due to an increase in transition services provided to support certain divestitures in 2010 and 2009 other net in 2010 primarily includes a 43 million realized gain due to distributions received in 2010 from the funds held by the reserve that exceed their book value and 19 million in miscellaneous income partially offset by 29 million in foreign currency losses 

  

2009 compared to 2008 nonoperating income net decreased in 2009 interest and dividend income decreased due to cash balances invested in lower interest rate securities in 2009 in 2008 net gain on divestiture 

  

of businesses includes a 778 million gain upon divestiture of our remaining 49 ownership interest in the jamba joint ventures income from transition services agreements increased primarily due to an increase in transition services provided to support the buyers of certain divested businesses during 2009 other net in 2009 primarily includes the cash receipt of 33 million from certicom corporation “certicom” upon termination of the acquisition agreement entered into with certicom and 10 million in miscellaneous rental income partially offset by 23 million in foreign currency losses other net in 2008 includes a charge of 82 million for an otherthantemporary impairment of moneymarket investments in funds held by the reserve as a result of management’s assessment for our investment portfolio with consideration to the economic market conditions at the time 

  

income tax expense 

  

   

our effective tax rate for 2010 differs from the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign operations and a change in estimated tax expense related to a divested business offset by the tax effects of state tax rate changes and an increase in accruals for uncertain tax positions 

  

our effective tax rate for 2009 differs from the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign operations a state tax law change a favorable state tax audit result and releases of reserves related to lapses of statute of limitations 

  

our effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the statutory federal rate of 35 primarily due to tax benefits from foreign operations the release of valuation allowances and releases of accruals for uncertain tax positions related to statute closures offset by the tax expense related to the conclusion of an internal revenue service audit 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 1455 million before the offset of certain deferred liabilities with the exception of certain deferred tax assets related to book and tax bases differences of certain investments and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets during 2010 we reduced our valuation allowance by 267 million previously applied to capital loss carryforwards as sufficient capital gains were generated during 2010 we increased our valuation allowance by 128 million in 2010 mainly for a loss carryforward in a foreign jurisdiction because we do not expect to generate sufficient taxable income in that jurisdiction in the future 

  

we qualify for tax holidays in switzerland and india in switzerland the tax holidays provide reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of investment and employment in switzerland the tax holiday on certain income types expires in 2011 and the tax holiday on remaining income types expires in 2015 in india we have qualified for the software technology park of india “stpi” tax program with respect to our research and development activities this exemption is scheduled to expire on march 31 2011 notwithstanding qualification for this exemption we are subject to minimum alternative tax rules in india which override the stpi regime and subject us to minimum tax on qualifying income due to net operating loss carryforwards from prior years the tax holidays did not have a material impact on our earnings per share for 2009 and 2008 the tax holidays increased our diluted earnings per share in 2010 by 012 

  

  

  

income loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

  

in 2010 we sold our authentication services business and ceased the operations of our cps business the results of operations of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

in 2009 we sold the following businesses mdg services mmm services gsc mss rtp services communications services and international clearing in 2009 we also ceased the operations of the prepay services business the results of operations of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

in 2008 we sold the following businesses emm postpay communications consulting dbms cdn sca and the remaining 49 ownership interest in the jamba joint ventures the results of operations of these businesses except cdn and the jamba joint ventures have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented we retained an equity ownership in the cdn business as a result of the continuing involvement in the cdn business the historical results of operations of the cdn business have not been classified as discontinued operations 

  

for a period of time we will continue to generate cash flows and will report income statement activity in continuing operations that are associated with the authentication services business and certain other completed divestitures these activities are transitional in nature and generally result from agreements ensuring and facilitating the orderly transfer of business operations the nature magnitude and duration of the agreements vary depending on the specific circumstances of the service location or business need the existing agreements include the following data center hosting support of financial processes and information services as of december 31 2010 the existing agreements have remaining terms from 1 to 31 months in length 

  

the following table presents the revenues and the components of income loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

  

  

   

the differences between income tax expenses and the amounts resulting from application of the federal statutory rate of 35 to income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes are primarily attributable to nondeductible goodwill transferred or writtenoff in the divestitures or impairments and the realization of deductible capital loss from divestitures 

  

net gains on disposal are recorded on the date the sale of the disposal group is consummated full or partial reversals of previously reported estimated losses on disposal are recorded upon changes in the fair values andor carrying values of the disposal groups 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

as of december 31 2010 our principal source of liquidity was 156 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 5012 million of marketable securities 

  

we received 116 billion 4694 million and 2743 million of cash proceeds from divestiture of businesses net of cash contributed and transaction costs for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

in december 2010 we declared and paid a special dividend of 300 per share of our common stock totaling 5182 million as a result of the dividend we also paid 1091 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures 

  

in 2010 we repurchased approximately 157 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 2793 for an aggregate cost of 4377 million in 2009 we repurchased approximately 113 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 2231 for an aggregate cost of 2528 million in 2008 we repurchased approximately 386 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 3407 for an aggregate cost of 131 billion as of december 31 2010 137 billion remained available for further repurchases in the future 

  

we continue to evaluate various means to return approximately 650 million to our common stockholders in 2011 

  

we purchased marketable securities of 7877 million and received 2846 million from maturities and sales of marketable securities in 2010 there were no purchases or sales of marketable securities in 2009 and 2008 we received distributions aggregating to 252 million 1295 million and 982 million from funds held by the reserve in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

we had income taxes payable primarily upon the gain resulting from divestiture of businesses of 1319 million 259 million and 415 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and other employee stock purchases 

  

we had a credit facility that permitted cash borrowings up to a maximum of 5000 million which was scheduled to mature on june 7 2011 we terminated this credit facility effective november 3 2010 

  

in summary our cash flows for 2010 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

  

   

  

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes and facilities operating cash flows presented in the table above include cash flows from the operations of the divested businesses and therefore are not indicative of future trends 

  

2010 compared to 2009 cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues including decreased revenues from discontinued operations coupled with the timing of receipts from customers higher income taxes payable primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the authentication services business before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and other employee stock purchases and the payment of contingent interest on the convertible debentures the decrease is partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees primarily resulting from the completion of our divestitures in 2010 and 2009 and lower average headcount in 2010 an increase in interest income resulting from investments in higher interest rate marketable securities and an increase in income from transition services agreements primarily due to an increase in transition services provided to support certain divestitures in 2010 and 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues including decreased revenues from discontinued operations coupled with the timing of receipts from customers and a decrease in interest income that resulted from investments in lower interest rate securities and an increase in income tax payment resulting from higher pretax income in 2009 the decrease in cash receipts was partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees primarily resulting from the completion of our divestitures and lower average headcount in 2009 

  

net cash provided by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to divestiture of businesses timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments and purchases of property and equipment 

  

2010 compared to 2009 net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of businesses an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities and investments and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment the increase is partially offset by an increase in purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds received from sale of an office building in 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of businesses and an increase in distributions received from the funds held by the reserve in 2009 the increase is partially offset by proceeds from the sale of certain office buildings in 2008 and proceeds received upon the termination of the trust established for our directors’ and officers’ liability selfinsurance coverage in 2008 in 2008 because of liquidity concerns we reclassified our activelytraded moneymarket investments in the funds held by the reserve from cash and cash equivalents to prepaid expenses and other current assets 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to stock repurchases and stock option exercise activities and dividend payments 

  

2010 compared to 2009 net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to the payment of a special dividend in december 2010 and an increase in stock repurchases the increase is partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase 

  

plan and an increase in realized carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan 

  

2009 compared to 2008 net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in stock repurchases offset by a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan and a decrease in realized carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plans 

  

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements our expectation of returning approximately 650 million to our common stockholders in 2011 and to service our debt for the next 12 months our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses related acquisitions and share repurchases we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

  

impact of inflation 

  

we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during 2010 2009 and 2008 

  

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2011 are anticipated to be in the range of 650 million to 750 million and will primarily be focused on productivity cost improvement market development initiatives and leasehold improvements 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant noncancelable contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

  

   

as of december 31 2010 we had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2026 the table above includes aggregate lease payments of 1056 million for a lease agreement entered into in 2010 of an office building containing approximately 221000 square feet in reston virginia to be used as our corporate headquarters the lease is expected to commence in july 2011 commensurate with taking control of the premises and will expire in 2026 the lease term is for 15 years and 5 months which includes a five month rent holiday followed by 18 months of a 50 rent concession 

  

we enter into certain purchase obligations with various vendors our significant purchase obligations primarily consist of firm commitments with telecommunication carriers and other service providers we do not have any significant purchase obligations beyond 2012 

  

  

  

we have entered into agreements with the buyers of certain divested businesses for which we continue to be responsible for certain contingent liabilities and transition services after the divestitures we might incur costs and expenses associated with the resolution of these contingent liabilities in addition the transition services may be required for periods longer than initially anticipated by management and may be costlier to complete when compared to the payments that will be received from the buyers for these transition services 

  

in 2007 we issued 125 billion principal amount of convertible debentures we will pay cash interest semiannually to the holders of the convertible debentures on february 15 and august 15 of each year until maturity we paid interest of 406 million on the convertible debentures in each of 2010 2009 and 2008 in december 2010 we paid 1091 million in contingent interest payment to holders of our convertible debentures as a result of the special dividend to stockholders 

  

in 2006 we entered into a contractual agreement with icann to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com toplevel domain through november 30 2012 under the agreement we paid icann fixed registry level fees of 180 million 150 million and 100 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

in 2001 we entered into an amended contractual agreement with the government of tuvalu to be the sole registry operator for tv domain names through december 31 2016 pursuant to the terms of this agreement in each of 2010 2009 and 2008 we paid the tuvalu government a total of 20 million annually in registry fees 

  

we provide for uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits accordingly due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2010 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 249 million of liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

  

we enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business we also entered into indemnification agreements with symantec in connection with the sale of the authentication services business see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” indemnifications of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2010 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

stock options and restricted stock units 

  

grants of stock options andor restricted stock units are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that options and restricted stock units dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock units granted while providing competitive compensation packages consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since 2008 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 03 per year calculated as the average annualized new options and restricted stock units granted net of options and restricted stock units forfeited by employees during the calculation period for example upon termination of employment divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period as of december 31 2010 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding options and restricted stock units regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price was 32 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all restricted 

  

stock units vest and are settled as of december 31 2010 18 of our outstanding options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 

  

consistent with our historical practices we do not expect that dilution from future grants of stock options and restricted stock units before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 20 per year for our ongoing business in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and restricted stock unit programs however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes 

  

options and restricted stock units activity from 2008 through 2010 is summarized as follows shares in millions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we invest in a variety of securities including money market funds debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies corporate debt securities and debt securities issued by foreign governments the primary objective of our shortterm investment management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and earning an aftertax return commensurate with the risks associated in each portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we invest in investment grade marketable fixed income securities 

  

  

  

in general money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our fixed income securities in our shortterm investment portfolio as of december 31 2010 arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

  

   

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary and nonmonetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months our foreign currency forward contracts are usually placed and adjusted monthly these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 

  

as of december 31 2010 we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 507 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would result in a decreaseincrease in income of approximately 49 million however this would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and nonmonetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

  

there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous as a result the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect income 

  

market risk management 

  

the fair market value of our convertible debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations as of december 31 2010 the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately 14 billion based on quoted market prices 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures

sale of other businesses 

  

in addition to the divestiture of the noncore businesses as part of our divestiture strategy we also sold the following businesses 

  

   

   

operations infrastructure 

  

our operations infrastructure consists of secure data centers in mountain view california dulles virginia new castle delaware melbourne australia london england kawasaki japan and fribourg switzerland most of these secure data centers operate on a 24hour a day every day basis supporting our business units and services the performance and scale of our infrastructure are critical for both our naming services and authentication services and give us the platform to maintain our leadership position in our core services key features of our operations infrastructure include 

  

   

   

   

as part of our operations infrastructure for our naming services business we operate all authoritative domain name servers that answer domain name lookups for the com and net zones as well as for the other toplevel domains for which we are the registry we also operate two of the thirteen externally visible root zone server addresses including the “a” root which is considered to be the authoritative root zone server of the internet’s dns the domain name servers provide the associated name server and ip address for every com and net domain name on the internet and a large number of other toplevel domain queries resulting in an annual average of over 55 billion responses per day these name servers are located around the world providing local domain name service throughout north america south america europe and asia each server facility is a controlled and monitored environment incorporating security and system maintenance features this network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the internet’s dns infrastructure 

  

in 2009 verisign completed most elements of “project titan” a largescale infrastructure upgrade intended to increase the capacity of domain name queries handled by our dns infrastructure project titan also further fortified our infrastructure to repel significant ddos attacks and provide enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities as part of the project titan implementation between 2007 and 2009 all of verisign’s infrastructure sites have been upgraded and more than 40 regional resolution sites were deployed

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we market our naming services worldwide through registrars we market our authentication services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including the internet direct sales telesales direct marketing through all media mass merchandisers valueadded resellers systems integrators and verisign international affiliates each a “verisign affiliate” verisign established the verisign international affiliate program in the 1990s to recruit resale partners to resell pki services in regions where verisign does not offer pki services verisign enables each verisign affiliate to operate all aspects of a pki service business by licensing to the verisign affiliate the verisign processing center software platform which provides a scalable certificate authority service platform capable of supporting thousands of enterprises and millions of end users each verisign affiliate is responsible for localizing pki services according to its local country regulations and requirements 

  

our direct sales and marketing organization at december 31 2009 consisted of 488 employees we have field sales offices throughout the world 

  

research and development 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had 571 employees dedicated to research and development we believe that timely development of new and enhanced internet security ecommerce information and technologies is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace during 2009 2008 and 2007 our research and development expenses were 836 million 889 million and 944 million respectively 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally or acquired through business acquisitions 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their 

  

  

rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete with numerous companies in each of the naming services and authentication services businesses the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

  

competition in naming services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum and coop gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 14 registries for the operation of 16 gtlds in addition there are over 240 cctld registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage for us 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolutions and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited and nominum inc 

  

in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc 

  

additional competition to our business may arise from the upcoming introduction of new internationalized domain name tlds “idn tlds” and new gtlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for awarding new idn tlds by the first half of 2010 other new domain extensions including ones for which we could apply could become available by the end of 2011 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business including the extent to which the earlier introduction of cctlds in local languages and scripts by other registries will constitute a competitive advantage while we may apply for one or more of these new domain extensions and seek to enter into agreements with other gtld applicants to provide backend registry services there is no certainty that we will ultimately be successful and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our competitors we do not yet know the impact if any these new domain extensions may have on our business but the increase of name availability in the marketplace could introduce new choices for endusers as well as create enduser confusion around brand preference which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

competition in business and user authentication services our business authentication services and user authentication services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for internet security services including network security authentication and validation which enable secure ecommerce and telecommunications over wireline and wireless ip networks principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as rsa security inc “rsa” the security division of emc corporation and entrust inc which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as identrust inc that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authorityrelated services 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services and 4 companies offering competing ssl certificate and other security services including domain name registrars 

  

the market for business authentication services and user authentication services is intensely competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we 

  

  

believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore aol inc and microsoft corporation have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products if these or other companies introduce new products or services that compete with our authentication services our business could be materially harmed 

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their websites could also promote products and services of our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future 

  

industry regulation 

  

naming services within the us government oversight of internet administration is provided by the doc effective october 1 2009 the doc and icann entered into a new agreement known as the affirmation of commitments which replaced a prior agreement known as the joint project agreement under the affirmation of commitments the doc became one of several parties working together with other representative constituency members in providing an ongoing review of icann’s performance and accountability the affirmation of commitments provides for more defined international participation in this review the agreement sets forth periodic reviews by committees the membership of which have yet to be determined these review panels are charged with reviewing and making recommendations regarding i the accountability and transparency of icann ii the security stability and resiliency of the dns iii the impact of new gtlds on competition consumer trust and consumer choice and iv the effectiveness of icann’s policies with respect to registrant data in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust under the affirmation of commitments the assistant secretary of communications and information of the doc will be a member of the “accountability and transparency” review panel the reviews generally are to occur no less than every three to four years 

  

as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com  net and name gtlds we have entered into certain agreements with icann and the doc 

  

com registry agreement on november 29 2006 the doc approved the registry agreement between icann and verisign for the com gtld the “ com registry agreement” the com registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com toplevel domain through november 30 2012 the com registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed for successive terms unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the com registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach the doc shall approve such renewal if it concludes that approval will serve the public interest in a the continued security and stability of the internet dns and the operation of the com registry including in addition to other relevant factors consideration of verisign’s compliance with consensus policies and technical specifications and its service level agreements as set forth in the com registry agreement and the investment associated with improving the security and stability of the dns and b the provision of registry services as defined in the com registry agreement at reasonable prices terms and conditions the parties have an expectancy of renewal of the com registry agreement so long as the foregoing public interest standard is met and verisign is not in breach of the com registry agreement 

  

we are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies as well as other provisions pursuant to the 2006 com registry agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations the 2006 com registry agreement also provides a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve additional registry services 

  

cooperative agreement in connection with the doc’s approval of the com registry agreement verisign and the doc entered into amendment no thirty 30 to their cooperative agreement—special awards conditions ncr9218742 regarding operation of the com gtld registries which extends the term of cooperative agreement through november 30 2012 and provides that any renewal or extension of the com 

  

  

registry agreement is subject to prior written approval by the doc as described above the amendment provides that the doc shall approve such renewal if it concludes that it is in the public interest and in the continued security and stability of the dns and that the provision of registry services is offered on reasonable terms 

  

net registry agreement on july 1 2005 we entered into a registry agreement with icann for the net gtld the “ net registry agreement” the net registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the net toplevel domain through june 30 2011 the net registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the net registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach 

  

name registry agreement on october 1 2008 we acquired the global name registry ltd “gnr” the holder of the name registry agreement which provides that gnr will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the name toplevel domain through august 15 2012 the renewal provisions are the same as for the net registry agreement 

  

the descriptions of the com registry agreement and amendment no 30 of the cooperative agreement are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this form 10k 

  

authentication services some of our security services utilize and incorporate encryption technology exports of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the us and various nonus governments we have obtained approval to export many of the security services we provide to customers globally under applicable us export law as the list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or changes government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals or we violate applicable laws we may not be able to sell some of our security services in international markets and may be subject to fines and other penalties 

  

there are currently no us federal laws or regulations that specifically control certification authorities but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to certification authorities if we do not comply with these state laws and regulations we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us moreover if our market for digital certificates grows the us federal state or foreign governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certification authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services these regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information

numerous applications to register verisign trademarks and claims and have common law rights in many other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s trademarks we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products particularly with respect to our ssl certificates

we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k and in other filings we make with the sec 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you 

  

  

should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our operating results may continue to be adversely affected by the current economic environment unfavorable market and economic conditions 

  

the current global economic environment may continue to have a negative impact on demand for our services our business and our foreign operations the economic environment has or may negatively impact among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to the extent that the economic environment impacts specific industry and geographic sectors in which many of our customers are concentrated that may further negatively impact our business if the economic and market conditions in the us and globally do not improve or if they further deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial position as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

  

our diversified business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results 

  

the successful operation of our business depends on numerous factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our international operations subject our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had 864 or 37 of our employees outside the us expansion into international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets failure to do so could harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us law or regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies procedures laws andor regulations violations of laws regulations or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

we are exposed to risks faced by financial institutions 

  

we have entered into hedging transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry which have been adversely impacted by the current economic environment defaults by and even rumors or questions about the solvency of certain financial institutions and the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions the hedging transactions we have entered into expose us to credit risk in the event of default by one of our counterparties despite the risk control measures we have in place a default by one of our counterparties or liquidity problems in the financial services industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

governmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

  

application of new and existing laws and regulations to the internet and wireless communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

  

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business for example laws designed to restrict the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children online gambling and cyber squatting and laws designed to promote cyber security may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 

  

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that state or foreign governments might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business 

  

in addition we are required to comply with state laws and regulations regarding certification authorities and if we fail to do so we could lose the statutory benefits and protections that would otherwise be afforded to us 

  

while we believe we currently have effective internal control over financial reporting we may identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and result in a decrease in the value of our securities 

  

we will continue to evaluate upgrade and enhance our internal controls because of inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements errors or omissions including those caused by human error the circumvention of overriding controls the violation of company policies or practices whether negligent or willful or fraud and any projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate we cannot be certain in future periods that other control deficiencies that may constitute one or more 

  

  

significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls our business and results of operations could be harmed the results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls or meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

  

issues arising from our agreements with icann and the doc could harm our registry business 

  

the doc has adopted a plan for the phased transition of its responsibilities for the dns to icann as part of this transition we are parties to agreements with icann and the doc as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com gtld and with icann with respect to being the exclusive registry for the name and net gtlds 

  

we face risks arising from our agreements with icann and the doc and from the planned transition of the doc’s responsibilities for the dns to icann including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition under the  com   net and  name registry agreements we are prohibited from holding a greater than 15 ownership interest in an icann accredited registrar this prohibition on crossownership currently applies to all sixteen icann gtlds but does not apply to cctlds icann is currently considering allowing the vertical integration of registries and registrars in terms of partners and owners in the upcoming round of new gtld registries this proposal is currently under review by the icann community and the timing and outcome is unknown additionally vertical integration of existing gtld registries may be considered by icann if vertical integration is permitted the impact to the distribution channel is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

  

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our naming services business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including governmental authorities in the us and other countries to our role in the ongoing privatization of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other risks it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our domain name registry business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions which may not also apply to our competitors on how this business is conducted 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the thirteen root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a nonregulated basis root zone servers are name servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the dns hierarchy these servers have the software and data needed to locate name servers that contain authoritative data for the toplevel domains these root zone servers are critical to the functioning of the internet consequently our naming services business could be harmed if these independent operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our naming services business could be harmed if any of the independent operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and to the extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root zone server system as provided in our registry agreement with icann it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the toplevel domain zone servers designated by us if icann does not do this our business could be harmed 

  

changes in customer behavior either as a result of evolving technologies or user practices may impact the demand for domain names 

  

currently internet users navigate to a website either by directly typing in its domain name into a web browser or through the use of a search engine if i web browser or internet search technologies were to change significantly ii internet search engines changed the value of their algorithms on the use of a domain for finding a website iii internet users were to shift away from direct navigation or iv internet users increase the use of second or third level domains or alternate identifiers the demand for domain names could decrease 

  

changes in the level of spending on online advertising andor the way that online networks compensate owners of websites could impact the demand for domain names 

  

some domain name registrars and registrants seek to generate revenue through advertising on their websites changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated including changes in methodologies and 

  

  

metrics by advertisers and advertisement placement networks such as google and yahoo could adversely affect the market for those domain names favored by such registrars and registrants resulting in a decrease in demand andor the renewal rate for those domain names as a result of the general economic environment spending on online advertising and marketing may not increase or may be reduced which in turn may result in a further decline in the demand for those domain names 

  

services offered by our 3is segment rely on the continued integrity of public key cryptography technology and various hashing algorithms that may be compromised or proven obsolete over time 

  

services offered by our 3is segment depend on public key cryptography technology with public key cryptography technology a user possesses a public key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and ensuring that it is not lost stolen or otherwise compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as “factoring” this integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult should an easy factoring method or other method be developed making currently used asymmetric key sizes such as 1024 2048 and 4096 bits inadequate the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology may require significant modifications or would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing pki services obsolete or unmarketable likewise hashing algorithms such as sha1 or sha2 are also utilized in public key cryptography technology and as new methods of attacking these algorithms are created they could render our pki services obsolete or unmarketable if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed that make attacks practical we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business in the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this negative public perception could harm our business 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in compromised customer data loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

if we encounter system interruptions we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

  

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in mountain view california and kawasaki japan both of which are susceptible to earthquakes new castle delaware dulles virginia melbourne australia london england and fribourg switzerland to the extent we are unable to partially or completely switch over to secondary or tertiary sites any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 

  

in addition our ability to issue ssl certificates our domain name registry services and certain of our other services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past 

  

a failure in the operation of our toplevel domain name zone servers the domain name root zone servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction harming our business or resulting in adverse publicity that could adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system the domain name root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability customers could be reluctant to use our services and we could be at risk for loss of various security and standardsbased compliance certifications needed for certain of our businesses such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of ecommerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the us in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the us patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our business would suffer if we lost the rights to use certain of these technologies additionally another party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could harm our business 

  

we rely on the strength of our verisign brand to differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products particularly with respect to our ssl certificates dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business 

  

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and could harm our business 

  

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties any claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel attention cause delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement was made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

  

we are involved in a number of investigations claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

in addition to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims we are involved in a number of investigations claims and lawsuits litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur adverse outcomes in some or all of these investigations claims and lawsuits may result in significant 

  

  

monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additionally these investigations claims and lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources from other matters 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic channel and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our internet infrastructure and security services than we would otherwise 

  

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

  

furthermore our ability to achieve future growth also depends on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple distribution channels in addition any changes by our channel partners to their existing marketing strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if one or more of our channel partners were to encounter financial difficulties it could have a material adverse effect on our business failure of one or more of our strategic or channel relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

failure of verisign affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

we have licensed to verisign affiliates our processing center platform which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the verisign affiliate to offer backend processing of pki services for enterprises in the regions in which the verisign affiliate operates the verisign processing center platform provides a verisign affiliate with the knowledge and technology to offer pki services similar to those offered by us it is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the verisign affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and customer service and support these practices are performed by the verisign affiliate and are outside of our control any failure of a verisign affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of ecommerce and telecommunication over ip networks generally 

  

our verisign identity protection services depend in part on the acceptance of our services 

  

the future growth of our vip services which form a part of user authentication services depends in part on the commercial success and acceptance and reliability of our vip services our vip services will suffer if our target customers do not use our vip services our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced vip services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our vip services or continue to use our vip services even after adoption 

  

  

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could be harmed 

  

we target our 3is segment at the market for trusted and secure ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks our naming services business is developing managed services in emerging markets that involve naming and directory services other than registry and related infrastructure services our authentication services business is working to expand our portfolio of business and consumer based authentication solutions through the development of new services that build on or complement current offerings these emerging markets are rapidly evolving may never gain wide acceptance and may not grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services in these markets is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services in these markets include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if the market for ecommerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business could be materially harmed 

  

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success also depends on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad 

  

all of the members of our senior management team and other key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our senior management team members or key employees the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

  

verisign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control or the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock and may make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan 

  

   

   

   

in addition section 203 of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless in the same transaction the interested stockholder acquired 85 ownership of our voting stock excluding certain shares or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner section 203 therefore may impact the ability of an acquirer to complete an acquisition of us after a successful tender offer and accordingly could discourage delay or prevent an acquirer from making an unsolicited offer without the approval of our board of directors 

  

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business as well as in the execution of our divestitures there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

  

in february 2010 the us president’s administration announced various legislative proposals that could change the us international tax laws we are unable to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented we have not yet determined whether or the extent to which these proposals will ultimately impact verisign 

  

risks relating to the competitive environment in which we operate 

  

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

  

general several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories andor significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and 

  

  

services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished 

  

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

competition in naming services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz pro aero museum and coop gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds icann currently has registry agreements with 14 registries for the operation of 16 gtlds in addition there are over 240 cctld registries furthermore under our agreements with icann we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of com  net and name on pricing bundling and use of registrars that do not apply to cctlds and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolutions and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neustar inc afilias limited and nominum inc 

  

in addition to the extent endusers navigate using search engines as opposed to direct navigation we may face competition from search engine operators such as google inc microsoft corporation and yahoo inc 

  

additional competition to our business may arise from the upcoming introduction of new idn tlds and new gtlds by icann on october 30 2009 icann approved a fast track process for awarding of new idn tlds by the first half of 2010 other new domain extensions including ones for which we could apply could become available by the end of 2011 we do not yet know the impact if any that these new domain extensions may have on our business while we may apply for one or more of these new domain extensions there is no certainty that we will ultimately be successful and even if we are successful in obtaining one or more of these new domain extensions there is no guarantee that such extensions will be any more successful than the domain name extensions obtained by our competitors 

  

competition in authentication services our business authentication services and user authentication services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for internet security services including network security authentication and validation which enable secure ecommerce and telecommunications over wireline and wireless ip networks principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as rsa the information security division of emc corporation and entrust inc which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as identrust inc which primarily offer digital certificate and certification authorityrelated services 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services and 4 companies offering competing ssl certificate and other security services including domain name registrars 

  

the market for business authentication services and user authentication services is intensely competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore aol inc and microsoft corporation have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products if these or other companies introduce new products or services that compete with our authentication services our business could be materially harmed 

  

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their websites could also promote products and services of our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future 

  

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

  

the internet and communications network services industries are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings in order to remain competitive and retain our market share we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and customer preferences or launch entirely new products and services in anticipation of market trends we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost effective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

  

risks related to our divestiture plan 

  

we continue to be responsible for certain liabilities and transition services following the divestiture of certain businesses 

  

under the agreements reached with the buyers of certain businesses divested under the divestiture plan we remain liable for certain liabilities related to the divested businesses in addition we have entered into and may in the future amend or extend transition services agreements with buyers in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses these transition services may be required for a longer period of time than anticipated by management in addition we have agreed to perform certain transition services for a fixed price or for fixed hourly rates but our actual costs to provide such services may exceed the fees buyers are contractually obligated to pay us under the relevant transition services agreements 

  

there is a possibility that we will incur costs and expenses associated with the management of liabilities related to the businesses we have divested including requests for indemnification by buyers these liabilities could potentially relate to i breaches of contractual representations and warranties we gave to buyers of the divested businesses or ii certain liabilities relating to the divested businesses which we retained under the agreements reached with buyers of the divested businesses such liabilities include certain litigation matters including actions brought by third parties where responsibility for such liabilities is to be contractually allocated to the buyer or shared with the buyer or another party it is possible that the buyer or the other party may be in default for payments for which they are responsible obligating us to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of those obligations 

  

following the divestiture of certain businesses our ability to compete in certain market sectors is restricted 

  

under the agreements reached with buyers for certain businesses divested under the divestiture plan we are restricted from competing either directly or indirectly with those businesses or from entering certain market sectors for a defined period of time pursuant to negotiated noncompete arrangements 

  

risks related to our securities 

  

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 1833 million shares were outstanding in addition of our authorized common shares 293 million common shares were reserved for 

  

  

issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of the 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 the “convertible debentures” as a result we keep substantial amounts of our common stock available for issuance upon exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans andor the conversion of convertible debentures into our common stock issuance of all or a large portion of such shares would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

  

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

  

as a result of the sale of the convertible debentures we have a substantial amount of long term debt outstanding in addition to the convertible debentures we have a credit facility “facility” with a borrowing capacity of 5000 million as of december 31 2009 we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and we had utilized 17 million of the 500 million limit for outstanding letters of credit the availability of borrowing capacity under the facility allows us immediate access to working capital if we identify opportunities for the use of this cash our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of corporate opportunities 

  

we may not have the ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of convertible debentures as required by the indenture governing the convertible debentures 

  

holders of our outstanding convertible debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase the convertible debentures upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture dated as of august 20 2007 the “indenture” between the company and us bank national association as trustee although we currently intend to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash as required under the indenture we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all in addition upon conversion of the convertible debentures we will be required to make cash payments to the holders of the convertible debentures equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the convertible debentures being converted and the conversion value as defined in the indenture of those debentures such payments could be significant and we may not have sufficient funds to make them at such time 

  

a fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under or result in the acceleration of the maturity of our thenexisting indebtedness our ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash or make any other required payments may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time our failure to repurchase the convertible debentures or pay cash in respect of conversions when required would result in an event of default with respect to the convertible debentures 

  

while we currently have the intent and ability to settle the principal in cash if we conclude that we no longer have the ability in the future we will be required to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the ifconverted method 

  

there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements could when adopted require us to implement different accounting methods which could have a material adverse impact on future or past results of operations which could in turn materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

naming services is the authoritative directory provider of all com net cc tv name jobs and edu domain names as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 967 million domain names registered under the com and net registries which are our principal registries the number of domain names registered is largely driven by internet usage and broadband penetration rates although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in mature markets such as the united states “us” and western europe growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us and western europe where internet penetration has demonstrated the greatest potential for growth we are largely insulated from the risk posed by fluctuations in exchange rates due to the fact that all revenues paid to us for com and net registrations are in us dollars verisign internet defense services provide infrastructure assurance to organizations and is comprised of verisign idefense security intelligence service “idefense” and verisign internet defense network “vidn” revenues from verisign internet defense services are not significant 

  

authentication services is comprised of business authentication services and user authentication services 

  

business authentication services enable enterprises and internet merchants to implement and operate secure networks and websites that utilize secure socket layer “ssl” protocol business authentication services provide customers the means to authenticate themselves to their end users and website visitors and to encrypt transactions and communications between client browsers and web servers we currently offer the following business authentication services verisign ®  thawte ®  and geotrust ® branded ssl certificates as of december 31 2009 we had an installed base of ssl certificates of approximately 12 million the major factors 

  

  

impacting the growth and performance of our business authentication services are the penetration and adoption of the internet especially through broadband services the spread of ecommerce the utilization of electronic means for executing financial transactions such as credit card payments and the extent to which advertising through search engines encourages consumers to engage in ecommerce as a result of the growing impact of the internet on global commercial transactions and the current economic environment we expect continued but slowing revenue growth in our business primarily in markets outside of the us where ecommerce has the largest growth potential 

  

user authentication services are intended to help enterprises secure intranets extranets and other applications and devices and provide authentication credentials we currently offer the following user authentication services verisign identity protection “vip” managed public key infrastructure “pki” and fraud detection services as with our business authentication services the major factors impacting the growth and performance of our user authentication services are the penetration and adoption of the internet especially through broadband services the spread of ecommerce the utilization of electronic means for executing financial transactions such as credit card payments and the extent to which advertising through search engines encourages consumers to engage in ecommerce 

  

we are working to expand our business authentication services business offerings and solutions through the development of new services including the verisign trust seal which will build on or complement current offerings the verisign trust seal authenticates that a customer is a legitimate business entity that owns and operates a website domain as well as provides assurance to website users that the website is free from malware we expect that revenues from the verisign trust seal will not be significant in 2010 

  

2009 business highlights 

  

   

   

   

   

   

divestiture transactions and sale of other businesses 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2007 we announced a change to our business strategy to allow management to focus its attention on our core competencies and to make additional resources available to invest in our core businesses the strategy called for the divestiture or windingdown of our noncore businesses we substantially completed this strategy during 2009 

  

  

during 2008 and 2009 we substantially completed all of our divestitures and the windingdown of our noncore businesses in october 2009 we decided to wind down the operations of the cps business after termination of active negotiations with a potential buyer we expect the windingdown to be completed no later than the end of 2010 the assets and liabilities related to cps have been reclassified to held and used and the results of operations of cps have been reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations as part of our other services segment for all periods presented the prepay billing and payment “prepay” services business was fully wound down in october 2009 and its results of operations were reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented having divested our noncore businesses additional resources are available to invest in our core services that remain naming services and authentication services the proceeds from the divestiture of noncore businesses will be used for but will not be limited to investment in growth opportunities in or adjacent to our core services 

  

completed divestitures in 2009 

  

during 2009 we completed the divestiture or windingdown of the following businesses for aggregate net cash consideration of 4774 million and recorded an aggregate gain on sale of 352 million the historical results of operations of our divested businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

during 2008 we completed the divestiture of the following businesses for aggregate net cash consideration of 1024 million and recorded an aggregate loss on sale of 4248 million the historical results of operations of our divested businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented unless otherwise noted 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

completed divestiture in 2007 

  

   

sale of other businesses 

  

in addition to the divestiture of the noncore businesses as part of the divestiture strategy we also sold the following businesses 

  

   

  

   

subsequent events 

  

in january 2010 we received a distribution of 84 million from the primary fund as of february 26 2010 we have an aggregate of 125 million held by the primary fund and the international fund 

  

in february 2010 we repurchased approximately 19 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 2377 per share for an aggregate cost of 443 million under the 2008 share buyback program as a result approximately 6529 million is available for repurchase of our common stock under our 2008 share buyback program 

  

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on our judgment and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates related to both the timing and amount of revenue recognition our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 

  

as our naming services and authentication services are provided over time the associated revenues from these services are generally recognized over the contractual term however certain revenues are recognized over an estimated relationship period determined based on an analysis of historical performance and customer usage 

  

while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions there are certain transactions that contain nonstandard business terms and conditions in addition we may enter into certain revenue transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable as a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including 1 whether an arrangement exists 2 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements 3 when to recognize revenues on the deliverables and 4 whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered in addition our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition

goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired fair value determination of acquired net assets especially intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgment these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to historical and projected customer retention rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator c unanticipated competition d loss of key personnel e a morelikelythannot expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof f testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit or g recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit judgment is required in determining the existence of these factors and their effect on any impairment determination 

  

the fair value of our reporting units is determined considering the income the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business the transaction approach is a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on market prices on actual transactions and asking prices for businesses currently available for sale 

  

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows operating trends discount rates control premiums and other variables of these businesses although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 

  

given the significant excess of fair value over our reporting units’ carrying value the goodwill valuations were not overly sensitive to valuation methodologies or assumptions further a hypothetical change of 10 in the fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in goodwill impairments as of december 31 2009 

  

our other longlived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and purchased intangible assets we review other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount such events or circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

  

recoverability of other longlived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows of the group containing the asset if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

  

valuation of assets held for sale 

  

disposal groups classified as held for sale were measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and were not depreciated or amortized classification of our disposal groups as held for sale occurred when sufficient authority to sell the disposal group had been obtained the disposal group was available for immediate sale an active program to sell the disposal group had been initiated and its sale was probable within one year if at any time these criteria were no longer met the disposal group would have been reclassified as held and used we evaluated the held for sale classification and the fair value of such disposal groups at each reporting period the fair value of assets held for sale was determined considering active bids from potential buyers and also using the income the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof the fair value analysis using the income market and transaction approach for assets held for sale was similar to the fair value analysis of reporting units for goodwill impairment described above and required significant judgment 

  

restructuring charges 

  

we record restructuring charges related to excess facilities and onetime severance costs at fair value only when the liability is incurred severance costs associated with our standard restructuring plans are recorded once the costs are determined to be both probable and estimable excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of the future lease obligations of the abandoned space including the potential for sublease income estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates changing market conditions by location and considerable work with thirdparty leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis as necessary 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

our 325 junior subordinated convertible debenture due 2037 the “convertible debentures” have contingent interest payments that are required to be accounted for separately from the debt instrument and marked to market at the end of each reporting period we utilize a valuation model based on simulations of stock prices interest rates credit ratings and bond prices to estimate the value of the derivative the inputs to the model include risk adjusted interest rates volatility and average yield curve observations and stock price several significant inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares which contain a service andor performance condition the determination of the fair value of stockbased awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

  

we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to postvesting exercise andor cancellations expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zerocoupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those 

  

  

estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record stockbased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 

  

we use the montecarlo simulation optionpricing model to determine the fair value of marketbased awards the montecarlo simulation optionpricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the blackscholes model however it also further incorporates into the fairvalue determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 

  

if factors change and as a result we employ different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods the stockbased compensation expense we record for such future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income loss net income loss and net income loss per share 

  

income taxes 

  

accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations such judgments include but are not limited to the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards domestic andor foreign tax credit carryforwards the adequacy of valuation allowances and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal state and international tax audits we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth selected information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues 

  

   

revenues by segment 

  

we have two reportable segments 3is and other services a comparison of revenues is presented below 

  

   

  

the changes in revenues for 3is and other services during the periods presented are described in the segment discussions that follow 

  

internet infrastructure and identity services 3is 

  

naming services 

  

revenues related to our naming services are derived from registrations for domain names in the com net cc tv   name and jobs domain name registries revenues from cc tv name and jobs are not significant for domain names registered with the com and net registries we receive a fee per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with internet corporation for assigned names and numbers “icann” individual customers contract directly with thirdparty registrars or their resellers and the thirdparty registrars in turn register the com  net  cc  tv  name and jobs domain names with verisign changes in revenues are driven largely by increases in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations in each case as impacted by our promotional programs as well as fee increases as permitted under our agreements with icann in december 2009 we announced a fee increase for com domain name registration fees of 7 from 686 to 734 effective july 1 2010 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for com domain name registrations up to 7 either in 2011 or in 2012 prior to the end of the current agreement with icann on november 30 2012 in december 2009 we also announced a fee increase for net domain name registration fees of 10 from 423 to 465 effective july 1 2010 we have the contractual right to increase the fees for net domain name registrations up to 10 in 2011 prior to the end of the current agreement with icann on june 30 2011 we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate 

  

the following table compares domain names ending in com and net managed by our naming services business 

  

   

during 2009 the growth in the number of domain names registered was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs though the growth rate is slower as compared to the previous year the slower growth rate in domain name registrations is primarily due to the impact of the macroeconomic environment however we started seeing improved revenue growth rates towards the end of 2009 resulting from an increase in new domain name registrations and renewals we expect to see continued improvement in revenue growth rates in 2010 as a result of further internet growth and adoption of the fee increase that will be in effect in july 2010 in addition we expect to see international growth in both com and net domain name bases especially in markets that we have targeted through our promotional programs 

  

our naming services revenues increased by 669 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a 7 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and increases in our com and net registry fees in october 2008 of 7 from 642 to 686 and 10 from 385 to 423 respectively as per our agreements with icann our naming services revenues increased by 1024 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a 12 yearoveryear increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net primarily due to continued internet growth and adoption and increases in our com and net registry fees in october 2007 of 7 from 600 to 642 and 10 from 350 to 385 respectively as per our agreements with icann revenues from verisign internet defense services comprised of idefense and vidn were not significant for the periods presented 

  

authentication services 

  

our authentication services revenues are derived from our business authentication services and user authentication services 

  

  

business authentication services 

  

revenues related to our business authentication services are derived from licensing and service fees charged to our customers for the issuance of ssl certificates that authenticate their identity to the third parties with whom they carry out secured transactions revenues in business authentication services are related to fees charged per certificate which are based upon a number of factors including i the brand name under which the certificate is issued which determines the level of encryption and rigor of authentication ii the number of servers authenticated and iii the duration of the certification we issue ssl certificates for periods ranging from one to five years the average certification issued by our business authentication services business is approximately sixteen months 

  

the following table compares the approximate installed base of ssl certificates in our business authentication services and annualized averageunit revenue “aur” for the installed base of ssl certificates 

  

  

   

during 2009 the growth in the number of installed base of ssl certificates was primarily driven by continued growth in ecommerce communication and interactions for websites our installed base of ssl certificates from our geotrust ® and thawte ® brands increased at a higher rate than our higherpriced verisign ® brand and as a result our annualized aur decreased compared to prior periods we expect that the number of our ssl certificates issued will continue to increase at a higher rate than the revenues recognized from our business authentication services in 2010 as compared to 2009 as we have a market share leadership position at the high end of the ssl certificates market our unit growth rate for the high end is limited by the overall segment growth in the mid and low segments we expect to see good growth opportunities for market share gains as these markets are growing faster than the high end market we expect revenues to remain consistent in 2010 as compared to 2009 

  

user authentication services 

  

revenues related to our user authentication services are derived from onetime credential sales to customers seeking network services and onetime setup fees we also charge an annual service fee based upon the number of individual users authorized by the customer to access its network and a customer support fee we expect user authentication services revenues to continue to grow in 2010 primarily from growth in our pki services driven by increased sales to our existing customers and demand from new customers 

  

our authentication services revenues increased by 113 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a 9 yearoveryear increase in the installed base of ssl certificates although this increase was offset by a decline in annualized aur and increased demand for our managed pki services our authentication services revenues increased by 503 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a 13 yearoveryear increase in the installed base of ssl certificates partially offset by a decline in annualized aur and increased demand for our user authentication services 

  

other services 

  

other services segment revenues decreased 124 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the termination of revenues from a service agreement with our former jamba joint ventures and the divestiture of the cdn business in 2008 and a decrease in revenues from the cps business in 2009 

  

  

other services segment revenues decreased 384 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to the divestiture of the rds business and the sale of our majority ownership interest in the jamba subsidiary in 2007 and the divestiture of the cdn business in 2008 

  

geographic revenues 

  

we operate in the us australia japan and other asia pacific countries “apac” europe the middle east and africa “emea” and certain other countries including canada and latin american countries 

  

a comparison of our geographic revenues is presented below 

  

   

revenues are generally attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our customers are located 

  

revenues from each of the respective regions increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily driven by an increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net and an increase in our com and net registry fees in october 2008 

  

revenues from the us increased by 727 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in the number of domain names ending in com and net  an increase in our com and net registry fees in late 2007 and an increase in demand for our authentication services revenues from apac increased by 269 million primarily due to an increase in revenues from our naming services as well as increase in revenues from our authentication services revenues from emea increased by 65 million primarily due to an increase in revenues from our authentication services businesses revenues from other regions increased by 81 million primarily due to an increase in revenues from both our naming services and authentication services businesses 

  

mature markets such as the us where broadband and ecommerce have seen strong market penetration are expected to see decreasing incremental growth rates reflecting the maturing of the markets we expect to see larger increases in certain international regions resulting from greater broadband and internet penetration and expanding ecommerce as electronic means of payments are increasingly adopted 

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of revenues consist primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services billing services operational costs associated with the delivery of our services registry fees customer support and training consulting and development services labor costs to provide security costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of cost of revenues is presented below 

  

   

  

2009 compared to 2008 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in depreciation expenses registry fees paid to icann and telecommunication expenses offset by a decrease in corporate overhead expenses depreciation expenses increased by 142 million primarily due to additional capitalization of internally developed software to support both the naming and authentication services businesses registry fees paid to icann increased by 50 million due to contractual obligations telecommunications expenses increased by 35 million primarily due to data center upgrades to support our current global constellation sites for our naming services business corporate overhead expenses decreased by 70 million primarily due to a reduction in headcount within the cost of revenues function during 2009 as compared to 2008 

  

2008 compared to 2007 cost of revenues decreased primarily due to decreases in direct cost of revenues salary and employee benefits expenses contract and professional services expenses and corporate overhead expenses partially offset by increases in telecommunication and other facility related expenses direct cost of revenues decreased by 52 million primarily due to the divestiture of our majority ownership interest in jamba in 2007 partially offset by an increase in outside consulting costs for our naming services business salary and employee benefits expenses which include stockbased compensation benefits expenses decreased by 36 million primarily due to a decrease in headcount as a result of our 2008 restructuring plan contract and professional services expenses decreased by 54 million primarily due to the divestiture of our majority ownership interest in jamba in 2007 corporate overhead expenses decreased by 64 million primarily due to a reduction in general corporate overhead expenses telecommunication and other facility related expenses increased by 81 million primarily due to upgrades to support our current global constellation sites for our com and net registries and our delaware data center that was placed into service in 2008 

  

sales and marketing 

  

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees costs of marketing programs such as the internet television radio print and direct mail advertising costs and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below 

  

   

2009 compared to 2008 sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in contract and professional services expenses and advertising and marketing expenses partially offset by decreases in travel expenses contract and professional services expenses increased by 39 million primarily due to using thirdparty professional services for international marketing initiatives for our naming services business advertising and marketing expenses increased by 30 million primarily due to efforts to increase the market penetration of our naming services and our authentication services business travel expenses decreased by 32 million primarily due to lower average headcount and management’s costsavings initiatives 

  

2008 compared to 2007 sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses travel expenses and corporate overhead expenses salary and employee benefits expenses which include stockbased compensation expenses decreased by 559 million primarily due to lower headcount resulting from the 2008 restructuring plan and the divestiture of our cdn business in 2008 travel expenses decreased by 61 million primarily due to cost savings initiatives relating to the 2008 restructuring plan corporate overhead expenses decreased by 60 million primarily due to a reduction in general corporate overhead expenses in 2008 

  

  

we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing spending 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees and the costs of facilities computer and communications equipment support services used in service and technology development and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of research and development is presented below 

  

   

2009 compared to 2008 research and development expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in depreciation expenses and contract and professional services expenses partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead expenses depreciation expenses decreased by 60 million primarily due to a reduction in capitalized assets depreciated to research and development expenses in 2009 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 13 million primarily due to a decrease in the services of outside contractors due to management’s costsavings initiatives and the conversion of contractors to employees corporate overhead expenses increased by 27 million primarily due to an increase in average research and development headcount to support our naming and authentication services businesses 

  

2008 compared to 2007 research and development expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in contract and professional services expenses and corporate overhead expenses partially offset by an increase in depreciation expenses contract and professional services expenses decreased by 63 million primarily due to decreased deployment of external consultants resulting from the 2008 restructuring plan initiatives corporate overhead expenses decreased by 40 million primarily due to a reduction in general corporate overhead expenses in 2008 depreciation expenses increased by 46 million primarily due to additional capitalized assets placed into service in 2008 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees bad debt expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead all allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations 

  

a comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below 

  

   

2009 compared to 2008 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and benefits expenses and contract and professional services expenses partially offset by an increase in legal expenses salary and benefits expenses which include stockbased compensation expenses decreased by 165 million primarily due to lower average headcount which resulted from recent restructuring activities 

  

  

contract and professional services expenses decreased by 56 million primarily due to a decrease in professional services costs incurred for accounting and auditing services related to our divestiture strategy which was substantially completed during 2009 legal expenses increased by 59 million primarily due to the reversal in 2008 of certain previously accrued estimated litigation settlement costs in excess of actual final outcome 

  

2008 compared to 2007 general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses contract and professional services expenses depreciation expenses and legal expenses partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead expenses salary and employee benefits expenses which includes stockbased compensation expenses decreased by 274 million primarily due to severance charges related to a former chief executive officer recorded in 2007 additional penalties recorded in the latter half of 2007 that resulted from late payments of federal and state payroll taxes and a reduction in headcount relating to the 2008 restructuring plan the decrease in salary and employee benefits expenses was partially offset by additional stockbased compensation expenses related to the acceleration of vesting of stockbased awards for a former chief executive officer in the second quarter of 2008 contract and professional services expenses decreased by 88 million primarily due to cost savings initiatives and reduction in external services as a result of our plan to divest or wind down our noncore businesses depreciation expenses decreased by 39 million primarily due to the sale of a portion of our mountain view facility in 2008 legal expenses decreased by 224 million primarily due to lower litigation expenses and the reversal of certain previously accrued estimated litigation settlement costs in excess of actual final outcome offset by an increase in legal consulting fees related to our plan to divest or wind down our noncore businesses during 2008 the decrease is offset by an increase in corporate overhead expenses of 151 million primarily due to proportionately higher headcount in the general and administrative function 

  

we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2010 primarily due to reduction in shared services expenses resulting from the completion of planned divestitures of our noncore businesses 

  

restructuring charges 

  

the following table presents the nature of restructuring charges 

  

   

as part of our divestiture strategy we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of 2008 the “2008 restructuring plan” which included workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities and other exit costs the restructuring charges in the table above are substantially related to the 2008 restructuring plan for 2009 and 2008 through december 31 2009 we recorded a total of 854 million in restructuring charges inclusive of amounts for discontinued operations 

  

2007 restructuring plan 

  

in january 2007 we initiated a restructuring plan the “2007 restructuring plan” to execute a companywide reorganization replacing the previous business unit structure with a combined worldwide sales and services 

  

  

team and an integrated development and products organization the restructuring plan included workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities and other exit costs the plan was substantially completed in 2008 through december 31 2009 verisign recorded a total of 305 million in restructuring charges inclusive of amounts for discontinued operations under its 2007 restructuring plan 

  

we anticipate recording additional charges related to workforce reductions and excess facilities through 2010 but these are not expected to be significant 

  

impairments reversal of goodwill and other longlived assets 

  

the following table presents the impairments of goodwill 

  

   

in 2008 we recorded an impairment charge of 776 million for goodwill related to our verisign japan reporting unit in continuing operations in 2008 we recorded an impairment charge of 458 million for goodwill related to our former postpay reporting unit in discontinued operations 

  

in 2007 we recorded an impairment charge of 1822 million for goodwill related to our former content services reporting unit in continuing operations 

  

the following table presents the impairments reversal of other longlived assets 

  

   

in 2009 we recorded an impairment charge of 97 million related to our name gtld intangible asset and a reversal of impairment charges of 08 million related to property and equipment of our cps business that was previously classified as a disposal group held for sale and subsequently reclassified as held and used in 2009 

  

in 2008 in continuing operations we recorded a loss of 791 million as a result of the sale of a portion of our mountain view facilities and an impairment charge of 85 million related to our cps business which was previously classified as a disposal group held for sale and subsequently reclassified as held and used in 2009 

  

in 2007 in continuing operations we recorded impairment charges of 258 million related to other intangible assets of the cdn and cps businesses and 80 million related to abandonment of certain obsolete property and equipment in 2007 in discontinued operations we recorded an impairment charge of 416 million for intangible assets and 52 million for the impairment of property and equipment related to our former content service reporting unit 

  

  

amortization of other intangible assets 

  

a comparison of amortization of other intangible assets is presented below 

  

   

2009 compared to 2008 total amortization of other intangible assets increased primarily due to additional amortization related to the acquisition of intangible assets of 66 million and the reclassification of intangible assets related to idefense of 41 million from assets held for sale to amortizable intangible assets in 2009 offset by intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2009 and 2008 amortization expense also increased due to additional amortization related to our name gtld which was purchased in 2008 and recorded as an indefinitelived intangible asset at the time of purchase and subsequently in 2009 was considered to be a finitelived intangible asset due to a strategic change in the planned use of the indefinitelived name gtld intangible asset 

  

2008 compared to 2007 total amortization of other intangible assets decreased primarily due to a 674 million impairment charge to other intangible assets in 2007 the reclassification of certain other intangible assets to assets held for sale during 2008 and due to certain other intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2007 we ceased to amortize our other intangible assets upon reclassification to assets held for sale 

  

other loss income net 

  

other loss income net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments interest expense related to our borrowings net gains or losses on the sale and impairment of investments net gains or losses on the divestiture of certain businesses realized and unrealized gains and losses on the contingent interest derivative on the convertible debentures income from transition services agreements and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses is included in other net in the table below 

  

a comparison of other loss income net is presented below 

  

   

2009 compared to 2008 other loss net increased in 2009 interest income decreased due to cash balances invested in lower interest rate securities in 2009 interest expense increased as a result of a decrease in capitalized interest cost in 2009 as compared to 2008 in 2008 we recorded a charge of 82 million for an other thantemporary impairment of funds held by the primary fund and the international fund as a result of management’s assessment for our investment portfolio with consideration to the economic market conditions at 

  

  

the time net gain on divestiture of businesses decreased because in 2008 we recorded a 779 million gain upon divestiture of our remaining 49 ownership interest in the jamba joint ventures in 2009 we recorded 05 million in unrealized gain on the contingent interest derivative on our convertible debentures as compared to 36 million of realized and unrealized gains on the contingent interest derivative on our convertible debentures in 2008 we entered into certain transition services agreements with the buyers of certain divested businesses the income received from such services were 49 million and 36 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively other net recorded in 2009 includes the net effect of foreign currency gains or losses and cash receipt of 33 million from certicom corporation “certicom” upon termination of the acquisition agreement entered into with certicom other net recorded in 2008 primarily includes the net effect of foreign currency gains or losses 

  

2008 compared to 2007 other income net decreased in 2008 interest income decreased due to lower average invested balances primarily resulting from stock repurchase activity in 2008 as well as lower average interest rates interest expense increased primarily due to our convertible debentures issued in august 2007 in 2008 we recorded a gain of 779 million upon the divestiture of our remaining 49 ownership interest in the jamba joint ventures in 2008 we recorded a charge of 82 million for an otherthantemporary impairment of funds held by the primary fund and the international fund in 2008 we recorded 36 million in unrealized gain on the contingent interest derivative on our convertible debentures compared to 153 million of realized and unrealized losses on the contingent interest derivative on our convertible debentures in 2007 we entered into certain transition services agreements with the buyers of certain divested businesses the income received from such services was 36 million in 2008 other net recorded in 2008 and 2007 primarily includes the net effect of foreign currency gains or losses 

  

income tax expense 

  

for 2009 2008 and 2007 we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of 801 million or 285 of pretax income from continuing operations income tax expense of 392 million or 349 of pretax income from continuing operations and income tax benefit of 35 million or 25 of pretax loss from continuing operations respectively 

  

our effective tax rate decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to benefits in 2009 attributable to increased profits in foreign tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates the lapsing of statutes the conclusion of a state tax audit state tax effects of tax law changes and expenses in 2008 related to the conclusion of an internal revenue service “irs” audit and impairments of nondeductible goodwill 

  

our effective tax rate increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to the expenses in 2008 attributable to impairments of nondeductible goodwill and the agreement to the conclusions of the irs examination for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 the increases in the 2008 effective tax rate were partially offset by the release in 2008 of valuation allowances and tax reserves related to the utilization of certain carryforward attributes and statute closures 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 3083 million before the offset of certain deferred liabilities with the exception of certain deferred tax assets related to impairments on investments and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards we believe it is morelikelythannot that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets during 2009 we released a valuation allowance of 16 million related to the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards and reduced the valuation allowance by 23 million upon the sale of a foreign subsidiary 

  

during 2009 the state of california enacted changes in tax laws that are expected to have a beneficial impact on our effective tax rate beginning in 2011 as a result we revalued our state deferred tax assets that are expected to reverse after the effective date of the change and recognized an income tax benefit of 49 million in state taxes for 2009 

  

  

during 2009 we agreed with the california franchise tax board’s decisions of its audit for the years ended december 31 2003 through december 31 2005 and recorded an income tax benefit of 34 million in state taxes for 2009 

  

we are subject to tax holidays in switzerland and india in switzerland the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of investment and employment in switzerland the tax holiday on certain income types expires in 2011 and the tax holiday on remaining income types expires in 2015 in india we qualify for the software technology park of india “stpi” tax program with respect to its research and development activities this exemption expires on march 31 2010 notwithstanding qualification for this exemption we are subject to minimum alternative tax rules in india which override the stpi regime and subject us to minimum taxes on qualifying income at a rate of 1133 due to net operating loss carryforwards from prior years the tax holidays have an immaterial impact on our earnings per share for 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net of tax 

  

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net of tax represents the portion of net income belonging to noncontrolling interest related to our consolidated subsidiary verisign japan 

  

the following table presents a comparison of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary net of tax 

  

   

2009 compared to 2008 the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary net of tax in 2008 is primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge related to our verisign japan reporting unit of 190 million in 2009 verisign japan’s operating income remained relatively consistent 

  

2008 compared to 2007 the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary net of tax in 2008 is primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge related to our verisign japan reporting unit of 190 million 

  

income loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

  

in 2009 we sold the following businesses mdg services mmm services gsc mss rtp services communications services and international clearing in 2009 we also wound down the operations of the prepay services business the results of operations of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented further in 2009 we decided to wind down the operations of the cps business after termination of active negotiations with a potential buyer accordingly the assets and liabilities related to the cps business have been classified as held and used as of december 31 2009 and the results of operations for the cps business have been reclassified as continuing operations for all periods presented 

  

in 2008 we sold the following businesses emm postpay communications consulting dbms cdn sca and the remaining 49 ownership interest in the jamba joint ventures as of december 31 2008 businesses classified as held for sale included the following mdg services mmm services gsc mss rtp services communications services international clearing and cps the results of operations of these businesses except cdn and jamba joint ventures have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented we retained an equity ownership in the cdn business as a result of the continuing involvement in the cdn business the historical results of operations of the cdn business have not been classified as discontinued operations 

  

  

in 2007 we sold the following businesses rds jamba service and 51 ownership interest in our whollyowned jamba subsidiary the historical results of operations of the rds business have not been classified as discontinued operations because they were not significant the historical results of operations of the jamba subsidiary have not been classified as discontinued operations because of our continued involvement in the jamba joint ventures the historical results of operations of jamba service have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

the following table presents the revenues and the components of income loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

  

   

the differences between income tax expenses and the amounts resulting from application of the federal statutory rate of 35 to income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes are primarily attributable to nondeductible goodwill transferred in the divestitures or impairments and the realization of deductible capital loss from divestitures 

  

net gains on disposal are recorded on the date the sale of the disposal group is consummated full or partial reversals of previously reported estimated losses on disposal are recorded upon changes in the fair values andor carrying values of the disposal groups 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

at december 31 2009 our principal source of liquidity was 148 billion of cash and cash equivalents 

  

in 2009 we received 4694 million of cash proceeds from divestiture of businesses net of cash contributed 

  

in november 2009 we purchased a previouslyleased dulles virginia office and data center property for the naming business for cash consideration of 261 million 

  

in december 2009 we sold an office building in savannah georgia for cash consideration of 61 million 

  

in 2009 we repurchased approximately 113 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of 2231 for an aggregate cost of 2528 million under the 2008 share buyback program as of december 31 2009 6972 million remained available for further repurchases under the 2008 share buyback program 

  

in 2009 we received distributions aggregating to 1132 million and 163 million from the international fund and the primary fund respectively 

  

  

in 2007 we issued 125 billion principal amount of 325 convertible debentures due 2037 we are required to pay cash interest semiannually on february 15 and august 15 of each year until maturity in 2009 we paid 406 million for interest on the convertible debentures 

  

in 2006 we entered into a 5000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “facility” with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions under which verisign or certain designated subsidiaries may be borrowers the facility is available for cash borrowings up to 5000 million and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a maximum limit of 500 million in 2009 there were no borrowings under the facility as of december 31 2009 the company had utilized 17 million for outstanding letters of credit under the facility 

  

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

  

   

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes and facilities 

  

2009 compared to 2008 cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues including decreased revenues from discontinued operations coupled with the timing of receipts from customers and a decrease in interest income that resulted from investments in lower interest rate securities and an increase in income tax payment resulting from higher pretax income in 2009 the decrease in cash receipts was partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees primarily resulting from lower average headcount in 2009 

  

2008 compared to 2007 cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers resulting from an increase in consolidated revenues inclusive of revenues from discontinued operations coupled with an increase in cash collections from customers due to an improved collection process implemented in 2008 the increase in cash receipts was partially offset by an increase in payments for interest on our convertible debentures and a decrease in interest income received due to lower average invested cash balances and lower interest rates in 2008 

  

net cash provided by investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to divestiture of businesses timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment and investments in unconsolidated entities 

  

2009 compared to 2008 net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of businesses and an increase in distributions received from the primary fund and the international fund in 2009 the increase is partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in our mountain view california location in 2008 and proceeds received upon the termination of the trust established for our directors’ and officers’ liability selfinsurance coverage in 2008 

  

  

2008 compared to 2007 net cash provided by investing activities decreased primarily due to the reclassification of certain cash and cash equivalents to prepaid expenses and other current assets in 2008 because of liquidity concerns the company reclassified its activelytraded moneymarket investments in the primary fund and the international fund from cash and cash equivalents to prepaid expenses and other current assets the decrease is also due to lower cash proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and cash spent on our acquisition of the global name registry business the decrease was partially offset by an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of certain businesses proceeds received from the sale of certain property and equipment related to a portion of our mountain view facility and the termination of the trust established for our director’s and officer’s liability selfinsurance coverage and lower cash spent on purchases of property and equipment 

  

net cash used in provided by financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations as well as stock repurchases and stock option exercise activities 

  

2009 compared to 2008 net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in stock repurchases offset by a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan and a decrease in excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation 

  

2008 compared to 2007 net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to stock repurchases in 2008 without corresponding proceeds from financing activities as compared to 2007 when stock repurchases were primarily funded by proceeds received from the issuance of the convertible debentures the remaining increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in stock repurchases in 2008 and a decrease in proceeds received from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan 

  

we believe existing cash and cash equivalents together with funds generated from operations and the availability of financing if necessary from our facility should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses related acquisitions and share repurchases we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

  

impact of inflation 

  

we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

property and equipment expenditures 

  

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2010 are anticipated to be in the range of 650 million to 850 million and will primarily be focused on productivity cost improvement and market development initiatives for our 3is segment 

  

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant noncancelable contractual obligations at december 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

  

   

as of december 31 2009 we had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2017 

  

we enter into certain purchase obligations with various vendors our significant purchase obligations primarily consist of firm commitments with telecommunication carriers and other service providers we do not have any significant purchase obligations beyond 2013 

  

we have entered into agreements with the buyers of certain divested businesses for which we continue to be responsible for certain contingent liabilities and transition services after the divestitures we might incur costs and expenses associated with the resolution of these contingent liabilities in addition the transition services may be required for periods longer than initially anticipated by management and may be costlier to complete when compared to the payments that will be received from the buyers for these transition services 

  

in 2007 we issued 125 billion principal amount of convertible debentures we will pay cash interest semiannually to the holders of the convertible debentures on february 15 and august 15 of each year until maturity we paid interest of 406 million on the convertible debentures in both 2009 and 2008 

  

in 2006 we entered into a contractual agreement with icann to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the com toplevel domain through november 30 2012 under the agreement we paid icann fixed registry level fees of 150 million in 2009 and 100 million in 2008 beginning in 2009 the agreement provides for contingent payments upon meeting certain criteria based on growth in the number of annual domain name registrations we have met the criteria and as a result our contractual payments will increase to the amounts as listed in the table above for the respective future periods 

  

in 2001 we entered into an amended contractual agreement with the government of tuvalu to be the sole registry operator for tv domain names through december 31 2016 pursuant to the terms of this agreement in 2009 and in 2008 we paid the tuvalu government a total of 20 million annually in registry fees 

  

we provide for uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits accordingly due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2009 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 290 million of liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

  

we enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2009 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements see note 15 “commitments and contingencies” offbalance sheet arrangements of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information regarding offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

stock options and restricted stock units 

  

grants of stock options andor restricted stock units are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders we recognize that options and restricted stock units dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock units granted while providing competitive compensation packages consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since 2007 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 07 per year calculated as the average annualized new options and restricted stock units granted net of options and restricted stock units forfeited by employees during the calculation period for example upon leaving the company divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period at december 31 2009 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding options and restricted stock units regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options and restricted stock units where the strike price is higher than the current market price was 55 this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all restricted stock units vest and are settled at december 31 2009 62 of our outstanding options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 

  

consistent with our historical practices we do not expect that dilution from future grants of stock options and restricted stock units before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 20 per year for our ongoing business in recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and restricted stock unit programs however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes 

  

options and restricted stock units activity from 2007 through 2009 is summarized as follows shares in millions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market risks we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we invest our cash primarily in money market funds in general money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate as of december 31 2009 our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary and nonmonetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months as of december 31 2009 our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations was not significant 

  

at december 31 2009 we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling 792 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would result in a decreaseincrease in income of approximately 74 million however this would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreigncurrency denominated monetary and nonmonetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 

  

a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 

  

there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous as a result the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect income 

  

  

market risk management 

  

the fair market value of the convertible debentures issued by us and due august 2037 is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations as of december 31 2009 the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately 11 billion based on quoted market prices 

  

the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk generally the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures

research and development 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had 954 employees dedicated to research and development we believe that timely development of new and enhanced internet security ecommerce information and technologies are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we have developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally or acquired through business acquisitions 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services 

  

  

particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

we compete in markets with our naming services security services commerce services communication services content services and managed security services we compete with numerous companies in each of these services categories the overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished 

  

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business see the section titled “the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share” of item 1a “risk factors” for additional details regarding our competition 

  

industry regulation 

  

naming services within the us government oversight of internet administration is provided by the us doc on september 29 2006 the doc and icann signed a joint project agreement to continue the transition of the coordination of the technical functions relating to the management of the internet domain name and addressing system to the private sector 

  

as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com and net gtlds we have entered into certain agreements with icann and the doc 

  

com registry agreement on november 29 2006 the doc approved the registry agreement between icann and verisign for the com gtld the “ com registry agreement” the  com registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the  com toplevel domain through november 30 2012 the  com registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed for successive terms unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the  com registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach the doc shall approve such renewal if it concludes that it is in the public interest and in the continued security and stability of the domain name system and that the provision of registry services is offered on reasonable terms 

  

verisign is required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies as well as other provisions in the 2006  com registry agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations the 2006  com registry agreement also provides a procedure for verisign to propose and icann to review and approve additional registry services 

  

  

cooperative agreement in connection with the doc’s approval of the  com registry agreement verisign and the doc entered into amendment no thirty 30 to its cooperative agreement—special awards conditions ncr9218742 regarding operation of the  com and  net gtld registries which extends the term of cooperative agreement through november 30 2012 and provides that any renewal or extension of the com registry agreement is subject to prior written approval by the doc the amendment provides that the doc shall approve such renewal if such approval serves the public interest and in the continued security and stability of the domain name system and that the provision of registry services is offered on reasonable terms 

  

net registry agreement on july 1 2005 we entered into a registry agreement with icann for the net gtld the “ net registry agreement” the  net registry agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the  net toplevel domain through september 30 2011 the  net registry agreement provides that it shall be renewed unless it has been determined that verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the  net registry agreement and has failed to cure such breach 

  

the descriptions of the com registry agreement and amendment no 30 of the cooperative agreement are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this report 

  

information and security services some of our security services utilize and incorporate encryption technology exports of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the united states and various nonunited states governments we have obtained approval to export many of the security services we provide to customers globally under applicable united states export law including our server digital certificate services as the list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or changed government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell some of our security services in international markets 

  

there are currently no us federal laws or regulations that specifically control certification authorities but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to certification authorities if we do not comply with these state laws and regulations we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us moreover if our market for digital certificates grows the united states federal state or foreign governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certification authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services these regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

communications services our communications customers are subject to regulations of the federal communications commission which indirectly affects our communications services business we cannot predict when or upon what terms and conditions further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or deregulation on our business several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services which may increase our costs of operations in addition future services we may provide could be subject to direct government regulation 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the united states and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in 

  

  

the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the united states patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property 

  

we have obtained trademark registrations for various verisign marks in the united states and other countries we have also filed numerous applications to register verisign trademarks and claims and have common law rights in many other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s marks 

  

with regard to our information and security services business we also rely on certain licensed thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography technology licensed from rsa a security division of emc corporation and other technology that is used in our security services to perform key functions rsa has granted us a perpetual royaltyfree nonexclusive worldwide license to use rsa’s products relating to certificate issuing management and processing functionality we develop services that contain or incorporate the rsa bsafe ® products and that relate to digital certificateissuing software software for the management of private keys and for digitally signing computer files on behalf of others software for customers to preview and forward digital certificate requests to them rsa’s bsafe ® product is a software tool kit that allows for the integration of encryption and authentication features into software applications 

  

with regard to our naming services business our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our registry service business and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses including the conversion of internationalized domain names we own our proprietary shared registration system through which competing registrars submit com and net secondlevel domain name registrations some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors 

  

with regard to our communications services group we offer a wide variety of services including network connectivity and interoperability intelligent database content and applications and clearing and settlement services each of which are protected by trade secret patents andor patent applications we have also entered into agreements with thirdparty providers and licensors including third party providers of content such as music games and logos 

  

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function 

  

   

we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions 

  

adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to downturns in the telecommunications and technology industries in the past and could impact our business in the future resulting in 

  

   

   

   

recent political turmoil in many parts of the world including terrorist and military actions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

  

our diversified business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results 

  

many of the companies we have acquired during the past 7 years operated in different businesses from our thencurrent business although we plan on divesting many of these businesses until our divestiture plan is complete our success will depend on many factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

to address these risks we must among other things continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

  

we may not realize the benefits we are seeking from our investments in the jamba joint ventures as a result of lower than predicted operating results larger funding requirements or lower cash distributions or otherwise 

  

we have a 49 equity interest in two joint ventures related to our former jamba business we will recognize our proportionate share of the income or losses of these joint ventures in our consolidated statements of operations we do not have control over the budget daytoday management or many of the other operating expenditures of the joint ventures and therefore we cannot predict with certainty the extent of the impact on our financial statements of these joint ventures for any particular period accordingly our share of the income or losses of these joint ventures could materially affect our results of operations in future periods 

  

the joint venture agreements contain provisions requiring minimum cash distributions to the members however these provisions are subject to conditions and limitations and therefore we cannot assure you that we will ever receive cash distributions from these joint ventures if the joint ventures require capital to fund their operations we could be required to make capital contributions or loans to the joint ventures the business operated by the us joint venture is a newer business and therefore it may be more likely to require additional funding although we cannot assure you that the netherlands joint venture will not require additional funding as well additionally we could be required to pay additional amounts to the joint ventures if it is later determined that we breached any of the representations or warranties in the formation agreement for the joint ventures 

  

the value of our investment in these joint ventures is subject to general economic technological and market trends as well as to the operating and financial decisions of the management team of the joint venture all of which are outside of our control in addition these joint ventures may not gain the expected number of customers andor generate the expected level of revenues and consequently we may never receive any cash distributions from these joint ventures and in fact they may require additional funding any of which could diminish the value of or dilute our investment our investments in these joint ventures may not provide the economic returns we are seeking and may not increase in value above the minimum amounts at which we can require fox or news corporation to buy our shares from us we cannot assure you that the commercial agreements including the gateway services agreement will provide us any benefit it is also possible that fox and news corporation could purchase our shares from us in the future prior to the businesses of the joint ventures reaching their full potential therefore we cannot provide you with any assurance as to whether we will achieve a favorable return on our investment 

  

we also entered into various other commercial relationships with the joint ventures however we cannot assure you that we will derive significant revenues from these other relationships 

  

our international operations subject our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 1200 employees outside the united states including europe asia australia and the americas expansion into international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our other services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets failure to do so could harm our business moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the 

  

  

importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition there are risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

governmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

  

application of new and existing laws and regulations to the internet and wireless communications industry can be unclear the costs of complying or failure to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

  

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business for example recent laws include those designed to restrict the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions or obligations for online services when dealing with minors such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 

  

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business 

  

  

we have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and result in a decrease in the value of our securities 

  

our management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 arising from internal control deficiencies in our stock administration policies and practices as discussed in part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” in addition due to the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2007 and the date of this report our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 

  

we will continue to evaluate upgrade and enhance our internal controls because of inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements errors or omissions and any projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate we cannot be certain in future periods that other control deficiencies that may constitute one or more “significant deficiencies” as defined by the relevant auditing standards or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls our business and results of operations could be harmed the results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls or meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our securities 

  

we have expended significant resources in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act in future periods we will likely continue to expend substantial amounts in connection with these compliance efforts and with ongoing evaluation of and improvements and enhancements to our internal control over financial reporting these expenditures may make it difficult for us to control or reduce the growth of our general and administrative and other expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our securities 

  

issues arising from our agreements with icann and the doc could harm our registry business 

  

the us doc has adopted a plan for the phased transition of the doc’s responsibilities for the domain name system to icann as part of this transition as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com and net gtlds we have entered into agreements with icann and with the doc 

  

we face risks from the transition of the doc’s responsibilities for the domain name system to icann including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our domain name registry business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including governmental authorities in the united states and other countries to our role in the ongoing privatization of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other risks it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our domain name registry business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the thirteen root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a nonregulated basis because of the importance to the functioning of the internet of these root zone servers our registry services business could be harmed if these independent operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our registry services business could be harmed if any of these volunteer operators fail to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and to the extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server system as provided in our registry agreement with icann it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the toplevel domain zone servers designated by us if icann does not do this our business could be harmed 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated 

  

  

software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

if we encounter system interruptions we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in mountain view california and kawasaki japan both of which are susceptible to earthquakes providence rhode island dulles virginia lacey washington overland park kansas melbourne australia and berlin hamburg and verl germany any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 

  

in addition our ability to issue digital certificates our domain name registry services and other of our services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past 

  

a failure in the operation of our domain name zone servers the domain name root servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction which could harm our business 

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system the root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure 

  

despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial 

  

  

and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our services such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

the reliance of our network connectivity and interoperability services and content services on thirdparty communications infrastructure hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control 

  

the success of our network connectivity and interoperability services and content services depends on our network infrastructure including the capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers in particular we rely on att sprint and other telecommunications providers for leased longhaul and local loop transmission capacity these companies provide the dedicated links that connect our network components to each other and to our customers our business also depends upon the capacity reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect telephone calls specifically we currently lease capacity from regional providers on four of the fourteen mated pairs of ss7 signal transfer points that comprise our network 

  

we have no control over the operation quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future our operations could be severely interrupted in addition rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies these mergers may cause the availability pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services that we use to increase significantly 

  

our signaling and ss7 services rely on links equipment and software provided to us from our vendors the most important of which are gateway equipment and software from tekelec and agilent technologies inc we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure product availability with these vendors we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products and services 

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends on our internally developed technologies patents and other intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the united states in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer additionally we have filed patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and patent offices outside the united states patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 

  

  

or at all our business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies additionally another party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could delay the introduction of our internet infrastructure services until equivalent technology if available is identified licensed and integrated this could harm our business 

  

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and which could harm our business 

  

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future in addition we provide links to news content as part of our realtime publisher service it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties any claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel cause delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our information and security services than we would otherwise our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

  

furthermore our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple distribution channels failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success also depends on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the united states and abroad in addition our 

  

  

stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel which consist of background checks into prospective employees’ criminal and financial histories further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions 

  

we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving verisign at any time in addition we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 

  

compliance with rules and regulations concerning corporate governance is costly and could harm our business 

  

ongoing compliance with the corporate governance requirements of the sarbanesoxley act and the nasdaq stock market has increased the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices and our compliance efforts have required significant management attention it is more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we have been required to accept reduced coverage and incur substantially higher costs to obtain the reduced level of coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

verisign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan 

  

   

   

   

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are 

  

  

subject to audit by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

  

risks relating to the competitive environment in which we operate 

  

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

  

competition in information and security services  our information and security services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for internet security services including network security authentication and validation which enable secure electronic commerce and communications over wireline and wireless ip networks the market for information and security services is intensely competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 

  

principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as rsa the security division of emc and entrust technologies which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as digital signature trust company a subsidiary of identrus that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authorityrelated services 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services and 4 companies offering competing ssl certificate and other security services including godaddy and other domain name registrars we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore netscape and microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products 

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future 

  

competition in managed security services consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services these companies include large systems integrators and consulting firms such as accenture ibm global services getronics and lucent netcare we also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services such as symantec and iss as well as a number of providers such as bt counterpane that offer managed security services telecommunications providers such as verizon business a provider of managed security services are also potential competitors in addition we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of ip addresses and name maps throughout enterprisewide intranets and with companies with internally developed systems integration efforts 

  

competition in realtime publisher services we face competition from various smaller companies providing similar services 

  

competition in digital brand management services we face competition from companies providing services similar to some of our digital brand management services in the monitoring services registration and domain name asset management area of our business our competition comes primarily from icann accredited registrars and various smaller companies providing similar services 

  

competition in communications services the market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure competition in this area arises from two primary sources 

  

  

incumbent carriers provide competing inhouse services in their respective regions in addition we face direct competition from national unregulated companies including syniverse technologies telcordia neustar and other carriers such as southern new england telephone diversified group a unit of att furthermore customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as verisign and further increase competitive pricing pressures 

  

competition in commerce services our wireless billing and payment services are also subject to competition from providers such as comverse amdocs convergys corporation and boston communications group we are also aware of major internet service providers software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are or may in the future be focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that may compete directly with ours furthermore customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from thirdparty providers such as verisign and further increase competitive pricing pressures 

  

competition in content services the market for content services is extremely competitive competitors include developers of content and entertainment products and services in a variety of domestic and international markets such as infospace itouch arvato mobile monstermob and motricity this business also faces competition from mobile network operators such as cingular verizon wireless sprint nextel corporation tmobile vodafone o 2  orange eplus and telefónica as well as internet portal operators such as yahoo aol tonline and google additional competitors are handset manufacturers such as nokia and software providers such as microsoft and apple as the market for wireless data including information and entertainment data matures new categories of competitors such as mobile phone companies broadcasters music publishers other content providers or others have begun to develop competing products or services 

  

competition in naming services we face competition in the domain name registry space from other gtld and cctld registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence including registries offering services related to the info org mobi biz name pro aero museum and coop gtlds and registries offering services related to cctlds there are currently 16 gtld registries and over 240 cctld registries 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolutions and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are ultradns neulevel afilias register com and tucowscom 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressure 

  

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

  

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

  

the internet and communications network services industry are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements which require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings in order to remain competitive and retain our market share we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and customer preferences 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a costeffective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

  

risks related to our divestiture plan 

  

we may face difficulties and incur costs associated with our divestiture plan and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

transitioning disposed businesses involves a number of risks including but not limited to difficulties separating operations services products and personnel the potential impairment of relationships with our existing customers the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees 

  

for example our divestiture plan will require a substantial amount of management administrative and operational resources these demands may distract our employees from the daytoday operation of verisign’s core businesses 

  

there is also risk that we may incur additional charges associated with an impairment of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions for acquisitions and dispositions under generally accepted accounting principles we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and to reevaluate goodwill and to evaluate other intangible assets as events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired further we are likely to incur income statement charges to complete the divestiture plan which could be material 

  

if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future dispositions our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect will result from the divestiture plan and such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all 

  

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect from the divestiture of verisign’s noncore businesses from our portfolio for example we may encounter difficulties identifying buyers for certain businesses or be unable to sell businesses identified for divestiture and there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will place greater value on verisign following the divestiture plan than the value placed on us predivestiture 

  

in addition there is no guarantee that the planned divestitures will occur or will not be significantly delayed completion of the plan of divestiture is subject to a number of factors including 

  

   

   

  

   

   

we may be adversely affected under certain covenants in our bank credit facility 

  

our bank credit agreement contains a negative covenant that limits our ability to sell assets and freely deploy the proceeds we receive from such sales subject to exceptions based on the size and timing of the sales therefore depending on the size and timing of any dispositions that we decide to pursue as part of our divestiture plan we may find it necessary to seek an amendment to our credit agreement or to structure the sales in a manner that complies with the covenant but that is potentially less favorable to the company than would otherwise be the case there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining any such amendment on acceptable terms or at all or be able to structure potential dispositions accordingly 

  

we may continue to be responsible for a portion of our contingent and other corporate liabilities following the divestiture of certain businesses 

  

it is possible that under the agreements reached with buyers for businesses divested under the plan we may remain liable for certain contingent and corporate liabilities there is a possibility that we will incur costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities these contingent and other corporate liabilities could potentially relate to consolidated securities litigation as well as actions brought by third parties as a result of the divestiture plan where responsibility for such liabilities is to be shared with the buyer it is possible that the buyer or another party may be in default for payments for which they are responsible obligating us to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of the assumed obligations 

  

completion of the divestiture plan may restrict our ability to compete in certain market sectors 

  

it is possible that under the agreements reached with buyers for businesses divested under the plan we will be restricted from competing either directly or indirectly with those businesses or from entering certain market sectors for a defined period of time pursuant to negotiated noncompete arrangements 

  

risks related to our securities 

  

we have a considerable number of common shares subject to future issuance 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had one billion authorized common shares of which 2228 million shares were outstanding in addition approximately 466 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans “equity plans” and approximately 364 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 the availability of substantial amounts of our common stock resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity plans or the conversion or repurchase of debentures using common stock which would be dilutive to existing security holders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

  

we have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

  

as a result of the sale of the 125 billion principal amount of 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures we have a substantially greater amount of long term debt than we have maintained in the past in addition to the debentures we have a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 500 million while we currently have no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility its availability allows us immediate access 

to working capital if we identify opportunities for the use of this cash our maintenance of substantial levels of 

  

  

debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may not have the ability to repurchase the debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay cash upon the conversion of debentures as required by the indenture governing the 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures 

  

holders of our outstanding 325 junior subordinated convertible debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase the debentures upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture dated as of august 20 2007 the “indenture” although we currently have the intent and the ability to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash as required under the indenture we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the debentures in cash or to make the required repayment at such time or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms in addition upon conversion of the debentures we will be required to make cash payments to the holders of the debentures equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the debentures being converted and the conversion value of those debentures such payments could be significant and we may not have sufficient funds to make them at such time 

  

a fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under or result in the acceleration of the maturity of our thenexisting indebtedness our ability to repurchase the debentures in cash or make any other required payments may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time our failure to repurchase the debentures or pay cash in respect of conversions when required would result in an event of default with respect to the debentures 

  

while we currently have the intent and ability to settle the principal in cash if we conclude that we no longer have the ability in the future we will be required to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the ifconverted method 

  

there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 

  

there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an impact on our future financial condition and results of operations for example in august 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued for comment the proposed fasb staff position “fsp” no apb 14a “fsp apb 14a” “ accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement ” that would significantly affect the accounting for convertible debt our 325 convertible debentures due 2037 would be affected by this proposed fsp the proposed fsp would require the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost further the proposed fsp would require bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component as equity and then accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to result in the “economic interest cost” being reflected in the consolidated statement of income in applying this fsp the fasb emphasized that the fsp would be applied to the terms of the instruments as they existed for the time periods they existed therefore the application of the fsp would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented if the fsp is approved it is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 and will require retrospective application the company would be required to implement the proposed standard during the first quarter of 2008 which begins on january 1 2008 although fsp apb 14a would have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows it would require us to record a significant amount of noncash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized in addition if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity any unamortized debt discount would result in a loss on extinguishment as a result there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and earnings per share these impacts could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and in turn negatively impact the trading price of the debentures 

  

see note 10 “junior subordinated convertible debentures” of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

  

certain other risks 

  

our communications services business depends in part on the acceptance of our ss7 network and the telecommunications industry’s continuing use of ss7 technology 

  

our future growth in our communications services business depends in part on the commercial success and reliability of our ss7 network our ss7 network is a vital component of our network services and has been a significant source of revenues for our communications services group our communications services business will suffer if our target customers do not use our ss7 network our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced ss7based services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our particular ss7 network solution or continue to use our ss7 network 

  

the inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our business 

  

significant technical challenges exist in our signaling and network services business because many of our customers 

  

   

   

   

customer implementation currently requires participation by our order management and our engineering and operations groups each of which has limited resources some customers may also require us to develop costly customized features or capabilities which increases our costs and consumes a disproportionate share of our limited customer service and support resources also we typically charge onetime fees for initially connecting a customer to our ss7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the connection is established if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our engineering service support we may experience reduced operating margins our customers’ ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and integrate them successfully within their systems depends on our customers’ capabilities and the complexity involved difficulty in deploying those services could reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause potential delays in recognizing revenues until the services are implemented 

  

our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our communications services at desired pricing levels and industry consolidation could adversely impact our revenues and cash flow 

  

the telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price competition competition and industry consolidation in our communications services could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion in our market share pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in the selling price of our services for example our competitors may provide customers with reduced communications costs for internet access or private network services reducing the overall cost of services and significantly increasing pricing pressures on us we would need to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of our customers generating higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs and we may not be able to do so successfully we believe that the business of providing network connectivity and related network services will see increased consolidation in the future consolidation could decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries which could erode our market share revenues and operating margins in our communications services group furthermore customers may choose to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services thereby reducing the demand for technologies and services we offer which could harm our business 

  

  

services offered by our internet services group rely on public key cryptography technology that may compromise our system’s security 

  

services offered by our internet services group depend on public key cryptography technology with public key cryptography technology a user is given a public key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and that it is not lost stolen or otherwise compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as “factoring” this integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult should an easy factoring method be developed the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing pki services obsolete or unmarketable if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business in the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this negative public perception could harm our business 

  

our content services business depends on agreements with many different third parties including wireless carriers and content providers if these agreements are terminated or not renewed or are amended to require us to change the way our content services are offered to customers our business could be harmed 

  

our content services business depends on our ability to enter into and maintain agreements with many different third parties including wireless carriers and other mobile phone service providers upon which this business is highly dependent for billing its customers 

  

these agreements are typically for a short term or are otherwise terminable upon short notice and in the case of agreements with carriers other mobile phone service providers and content developers are nonexclusive if these third parties reduce their commitment to us terminate their agreements with us or enter into similar agreements with our competitors our content services business could be materially harmed 

  

failure of verisign affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

we have licensed to verisign affiliates our processing center platform which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the verisign affiliate to offer backend processing of pki services for enterprises the verisign processing center platform provides a verisign affiliate with the knowledge and technology to offer pki services similar to those offered by us it is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the verisign affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and customer service and support these practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control any failure of a verisign affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over ip networks generally 

  

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could suffer 

  

we target our information and security services at the market for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks our naming services business unit is developing managed services designed to work with the epcglobal network and rfid technology pointofsale data services and 

  

  

realtime publisher services these are rapidly evolving markets that may not continue to grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if the market for electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business would be materially harmed

our business consists of two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group the internet services group consists of the information and security services business and the naming services business the information and security services business provides products and services that protect online and network interactions enabling companies to manage reputational operational and compliance risks the naming services business is the authoritative directory provider of all com net cc and tv domain names the communications services group provides communications services such as connectivity and interoperability services and intelligent database services commerce services such as billing and operational support system services and mobile commerce services and content services such as digital content and messaging services 

  

in late 2007 we announced a change to our business strategy to be more tightly aligned with our core competencies which is providing highly scaleable reliable and secure internet infrastructure services to customers around the world the strategy calls for divesture of a number of noncore businesses in our portfolio such as communications billing and commerce content delivery messaging and enterprise security services by divesting these noncore businesses additional resources should be available to invest in the core businesses that will remain naming services ssl certificate services and identity and authentication services we face a number of risks associated with our plan to divest ourselves of several noncore businesses the operations of these businesses will be classified as discontinued operations when all criteria of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “sfas 144” “accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets” are met all of such criteria were not met as of december 31 2007 as a result of these divestitures in 2008 we would expect revenues operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations to decrease in absolute dollars and expect a reduction in the number of employees 

  

effective january 1 2007 we adopted a functional business structure that realigned the internet services group and the communications services group to deliver products and services on an integrated basis through two main functional units sales and consulting services and products and marketing the sales and consulting services group is aligned by vertical industry and combines our multiple sales functions inmarket consulting services and business development teams the products and marketing group combines our product

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill longlived assets restructuring liability contingent convertible debt stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on our judgment and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenues in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred in order to determine current and deferred revenue we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 

  

revenues from consulting services are recognized either on a time and materials basis as the services are performed or for fixed price consulting as services are performed completed and accepted in some cases fixed price consulting is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project we 

  

  

have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed revenues from timeandmaterials are recognized as services are performed 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued eitf no 063 “eitf 063” “ how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement ” eitf 063 provides guidance on an entity’s disclosure of its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain taxes and provides that if taxes included in gross revenues are significant a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented ie both interim and annual periods taxes within the scope of eitf 063 are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction we record transactionbased taxes on a net basis these taxes are recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance each customer’s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above in addition we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future as of december 31 2007 the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 3 of total accounts receivable or approximately 63 million a change of 100 basis points in our estimate would amount to approximately 21 million 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense 

  

   

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 “sfas 142” “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” in accordance with sfas 142 such goodwill and other intangible assets may also be tested for impairment between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator c unanticipated competition d loss of key personnel e a morelikelythannot expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof f testing for recoverability under sfas 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit g recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 

  

we performed our annual impairment tests as of june 30 2007 2006 and 2005 the fair value of our reporting units is determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business in the application of the income and market valuation approaches we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables actual 

  

  

future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates there were no impairment charges for goodwill from the annual impairment tests conducted as of june 30 2007 2006 and 2005 

  

at december 31 2007 we performed an additional impairment test primarily as a result of our decision to divest our noncore businesses as a result of the impairment test we recorded an impairment charge of 1822 million 626 million and 43 million for goodwill other intangible assets and property and equipment respectively related to our content services business reporting unit see note 7 “goodwill and other intangible assets” of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of its annual or periodic analyses the company makes estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses although the company’s cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives the company also considers its market capitalization on the date it performs the analysis 

  

as the company divests its noncore businesses it may incur further charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the net book value of its reporting units exceeds the estimated fair value any additional future impairment charges could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

  

valuation of longlived assets 

  

our longlived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas 144 such events or circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

  

recoverability of longlived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 

  

restructuring charges 

  

we record restructuring charges related to workforce reduction in accordance with sfas no 112 “sfas 112” “employers’ accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 5 and 43” since benefits are provided pursuant to a severance plan which uses a standard formula of paying benefits based upon tenure with the company the accounting for such restructuring charges meets the four requirements of sfas 112 which are i our obligation relating to employees’ rights to receive compensation for future absences is attributable to employees’ services already rendered ii the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate iii payment of the compensation is probable and iv the amount can be reasonably estimated 

  

we record restructuring charges related to excess facilities and other exit costs in accordance with sfas no 146 “sfas 146”  “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be measured and recognized initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space including the potential for sublease income estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located such as the supply of 

  

  

office space and prevailing lease rates changing market conditions by location and considerable work with thirdparty leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis as necessary 

  

contingent convertible debentures 

  

we account for our contingent convertible debentures and related provisions in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 985 “ accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios ” eitf no 0027 “ application of issue no 985 to certain convertible instruments ” eitf no 0019 “ accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock ” and eitf no 016 “ the meaning of ‘indexed to a company’s own stock’” eitf no 0408 “eitf 0408” “ the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share ” and eitf 9019 “ convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion ” we also evaluate the instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 “sfas 133” “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” which requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments and measurement of fair value for accounting purposes eitf 0408 requires us to include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and the current ability to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the initial conversion price per share of 3437 

  

we consider the embedded features related to the contingent interest payments overallotment option and our ability to make specific types of distributions eg extraordinary dividends to qualify as derivatives and bundle them as a compound embedded derivative under sfas 133 the fair value of the derivative at the date of issuance of the debentures is accounted for as a discount on the debentures the overallotment feature which was revalued on the date of exercise is accounted for as a premium on the debentures the debt discount and the debt premium are being accreted to the face value of the debentures as interest expense net over the maturity period of the debentures any change in the fair value of this embedded derivative is recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in other income net 

  

we account for our investments in joint ventures as equity method investments based on our ability to exert significant influence but not control over the joint ventures verisign records its investments at the amount of capital contributed plus its percentage interest in the joint ventures’ earnings or loss we regularly review the operating and financial results based on information provided by these joint ventures and determine the fair values of these investments based on a valuation performed using the income approach and the market approach if it is determined that an otherthantemporary decline exists in the fair values of these investments we write down the investments to their fair value and record the related impairments in earnings from unconsolidated entities 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sfas 123r” “ sharebased payment ” sfas 123r replaced sfas no 123 “sfas 123” “ accounting for stockbased compensation” and superseded accounting principles board opinion no 25 “apb 25” “ accounting for stock issued to employees ” we elected the modified prospective application method under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes the valuation provisions of sfas 123r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified for stockbased awards granted on or after january 1 2006 we will amortize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is the vesting period estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the sfas 123 pro forma disclosures 

  

  

we currently use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares the determination of the fair value of stockbased awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

  

we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to postvesting exercise andor cancellations expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zerocoupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record stockbased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest all stockbased awards are amortized on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods 

  

we use the montecarlo simulation optionpricing model to determine the fair value of marketbased awards the montecarlo simulation optionpricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the blackscholes model however it also further incorporates into the fairvalue determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and the impact of the possible differing stock price paths compensation costs related to awards with a marketbased condition will be recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied provided that the requisite service has been provided the stockbased compensation expense for marketbased awards is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for each such award 

  

if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income net income and net income per share 

  

see note 13 “stockbased compensation” of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas 123r disclosures 

  

income taxes 

  

we adopted fasb interpretation number 48 “fin 48” “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” on january 1 2007 fin 48 is an interpretation of sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes” and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition under fin 48 an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold in accordance with our accounting policy we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 was a decrease in income taxes payable of 93 million an increase in longterm deferred tax assets of 262 million and a decrease in the january 1 2007 accumulated deficit balance of 355 million included in this amount is an adjustment made by the company to increase accumulated deficit by 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 at the adoption date of january 1 2007 we had an unrecognized tax benefit for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions of 450 million as of december 31 2007 this amount was 414 million

revenues by segment 

  

in 2007 2006 and 2005 we had two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group a comparison of revenues from continuing operations is presented below 

  

   

internet services group isg 

  

2007 compared to 2006 revenues from our isg increased by approximately 1582 million our naming services revenues increased 919 million due to a 24 increase in the number of active domain names ending in com and net under management the growth in com and net domain names was driven by continued global internet adoption and strong renewal rates of existing domains our information and security services revenues increased 557 million primarily due to a 439 million increase in ssl certificate services revenues that was the result of a 16 increase in the installed base of ssl certificates and recognizing a full year of revenues from the geotrust acquisition in late 2006 additional increases in our information and security services revenues were primarily due to increases in our verisign identity protection services and our united authentication services that was the result of an increase in demand for secure realtime validation capabilities 

  

2006 compared to 2005 revenues from our isg increased by approximately 1250 million our naming services revenues increased 694 million due to a 30 increase in the number of active domain names ending in com and net under management our information and security services revenues increased 556 million primarily due to a 293 million increase in ssl certificate revenues that was the result of a 65 increase in the installed base of ssl certificates an 119 million increase in our managed security services and security consulting revenues and a 144 million increase in other information services revenues the 65 increase in the installed base of ssl certificates was primarily due to the 259000 additional certificates acquired as a result of the acquisition of geotrust in september of 2006 excluding the geotrust transaction the installed base of ssl certificates would have increased 12 yearoveryear 

  

the following table compares active domain names ending in com and net managed by our information services business and the approximate installed base of ssl certificates in our commerce site services business as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

communications services group csg 

  

2007 compared to 2006 revenues from our csg decreased approximately 2249 million primarily due to a decrease in revenues directly related to the divestiture of our majority ownership interest in our jamba business unit in january 2007 in 2007 we recognized one month of jamba revenues totaling 238 million and in 2006 we recognized twelve months of jamba revenues totaling 2854 million our commerce and communications services revenues decreased by 410 million primarily due to a 214 million decrease in commerce and billing services revenues and a 196 million decrease in communication services revenues the decrease in revenues from commerce and billing services was primarily due to a 206 million decline in payment service revenues and the decrease in revenues from communications services was primarily due to 

  

  

declines in revenues from connectivity and signaling services and intelligent data base services that resulted from continued industry consolidation among telecommunication companies and pricing pressures these declines were offset by a 449 million increase in professional communications consulting services revenues which was primarily due to our acquisition of incode in december 2006 and a 324 million increase in content services revenues which was primarily due to recognizing a full year of revenues in 2007 for acquisitions in 2006 

  

2006 compared to 2005 revenues from our csg decreased approximately 1666 million primarily due to a decrease in our content services revenues which includes our digital content messaging and mobile delivery services of 1594 million the decrease in content services revenues was primarily due to a 2377 million decrease in revenues from jamba partially offset by a 260 million increase in messaging services revenues and a 462 million increase in revenues as a result of 2006 acquisitions the decline in our content services business was primarily attributable to increased pricing pressure and a decline in the number of subscribers our commerce and communications services revenues decreased by 78 million compared to 2005 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a 134 million decrease in clearing and settlement services and a 67 million decrease in connectivity and database services these declines were primarily due to industry consolidation and pricing pressures these declines were partially offset by 64 million increase in revenues from billing and payment services which was primarily due to the result of an increase in the number of subscribers revenues in 2006 include 578 million in additional revenue as a result of acquisitions in 2006

restructuring impairments and other charges reversals net 

  

the following table presents a comparison of the restructuring impairments and other charges reversals net 

  

   

the changes in restructuring impairments and other charges reversals net are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives 

  

2007 restructuring plan  in january 2007 we initiated a restructuring plan to execute a companywide reorganization replacing our previous business unit structure with a new combined worldwide sales and services team and an integrated development and products organization the restructuring plan included workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities and other charges 

  

2002 and 2003 restructuring plans in november 2003 we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units in april 2002 we initiated a plan to restructure our operations to rationalize integrate and align resources all remaining charges relating to the 2002 and 2003 plans will be incurred by 2008 

  

impairments and other charges during 2007 we recognized an impairment charge of 626 million for other intangible assets of the content services business reporting unit as a result of the impairment test conducted as required by sfas 142 and sfas 144 as of december 31 2007 during 2007 we wroteoff an additional 48 million of other intangible assets primarily related to a significant change in the operations of an asset group during 2006 we wrote off approximately 20 million of other intangible assets specifically related to abandoned technology acquired for a specific customer other charges comprised of excess and obsolete property and equipment that were impaired disposed of or abandoned 

  

other charges comprised of excess and obsolete property and equipment that were impaired disposed of or abandoned during 2007 we recognized an impairment charge of 43 million for property and equipment net of the content services business reporting unit as a result of the impairment test conducted as required by sfas 144 as of december 31 2007 during 2007 we recorded additional other charges of approximately 90 million primarily for the abandonment of obsolete property and equipment and impairment specifically related to a significant change in the operations of an asset group during 2005 we recorded an impairment of approximately 224 million relating to the abandonment of the development efforts related to an internally developed software project 

  

see note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” and note 5 “restructuring impairments and other charges reversals net” of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

impairment of goodwill 

  

at december 31 2007 we recorded an impairment charge of 1822 million relating to our content services business reporting unit as a result of our decision to divest our noncore businesses see note 7 “goodwill and other intangible assets” of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

  

amortization of other intangible assets 

  

the following table presents a comparison of our amortization of other intangible assets 

  

   

2007 compared to 2006 amortization of other intangible assets decreased approximately 67 million primarily due to the other intangible assets sold as part of the jamba divestiture and other intangible assets becoming fully amortized these decreases were offset by a full year of amortization related to other intangible assets acquired in 2006 

  

2006 compared to 2005 amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately 211 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to other intangible assets acquired in 2005 and new intangible assets acquired in 2006 other intangible amortization expense as a result of business acquired in 2006 was approximately 291 million 

  

our anticipated 2008 amortization expense is expected to be approximately 373 million this amount should decrease as we dispose of our existing business units with net other intangible assets this amount may increase if we acquire any additional companies with other intangible assets 

  

see note 7 “goodwill and other intangible assets” of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

acquired inprocess research and development 

  

in 2007 we did not writeoff any inprocess research and development “iprd” during 2006 we wroteoff approximately 167 million of iprd acquired in the callvision kontiki mqube and geotrust transactions during 2005 we wrote off 77 million of iprd acquired in the purchase of lightsurf technologies idefense moreover and retail solutions international at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses accordingly these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

  

other income net 

  

other income net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments interest expense related to our borrowings gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments gains and losses on divestiture of businesses unrealized gains and losses on joint venture call options realized and unrealized gains and losses on embedded derivative and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses 

  

  

the following table presents the components of other income net 

  

   

2007 compared to 2006 other income net increased approximately 511 million in 2007 interest income increased approximately 201 million primarily as a result of higher cash balances throughout the year interest expense increased approximately 104 million primarily due to interest expense related to our convertible debentures issued in august 2007 we recognized a gain of approximately 682 million upon the divestiture of our majority ownership interest in our jamba business unit we recorded 109 million of unrealized gain on the joint venture call options and 153 million of realized and unrealized losses on the embedded derivative associated with our convertible debentures due to the fact that we are required to marktomarket the fair value of these call options and the embedded derivative at each reporting period such revaluations could result in further gains or losses other activity during 2007 included a 18 million net loss on the sale of investments and a 30 million gain on the divestiture of a business unit 

  

2006 compared to 2005 other income net decreased approximately 93 million primarily due to 78 million in interest expense related to our outstanding balance from our credit facility in 2006 we recorded a 217 million gain on sale of our remaining equity ownership interest in network solutions in 2006 interest income decreased 27 million primarily as a result of a decrease in our shortterm investment balances other net decreased approximately 87 million primarily due to a 60 million gain recorded in 2005 

  

income tax expense 

  

in the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of 111 million or 87 of pretax loss income tax benefit of 2436 million or 1825 of pretax income and income tax expense of 1010 million or 377 of pretax income respectively 

  

our effective tax rate in 2007 differs from 2006 primarily because of the 2007 impairment to goodwill which is nondeductible for tax purposes the 2006 reduction in our valuation allowance and the implementation in 2006 of a global business structure our effective tax rate in 2007 also differs from 2006 because we were granted relief from the internal revenue service “irs” in 2006 for an uncertainty regarding a tax benefit resulting from a prior divestiture as a result we benefited income tax expense of 1134 million in 2006 

  

prior to 2006 we provided a tax valuation allowance on our united states “us” federal and state deferred tax assets based on our evaluation that realizability of such assets was not “more likely than not” as required by generally accepted accounting principles we continuously evaluated additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets such deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards temporary differences on taxdeductible goodwill and intangible assets and temporary differences on deferred revenue in 2006 based on additional evidence regarding our past earnings scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities we determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be 

  

  

realized accordingly we released our valuation allowance of 2364 million from our deferred tax assets resulting in a benefit to deferred tax expense in its statement of operations 

  

we continue to assess the future realization of net us deferred tax assets and believe that it is more likely than not that forecasted income tax effects of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities will be sufficient to support future realization of net us deferred tax assets 

  

we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets which we do not believe are more likely than not that they would be realized we continue to apply a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards and to book impairments of investments due to the limited carryforward period and character of such tax attributes the amount of deferred tax assets which continues to be subject to a valuation allowance was 533 million and 519 million as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 5209 million and 1363 million respectively including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 5209 million and 1304 million respectively related to the settlement of employee stock awards when recognized pursuant to the implementation guidance in sfas 123r these net operating losses will result in a benefit to additional paidin capital as of december 31 2007 we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 270 million 

  

if we are not able to use them the us federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2020 through 2026 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2008 through 2027 most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had us federal and state research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately 379 million and 221 million respectively of the 379 million federal research credit carry forward 79 million will be recognized as a benefit to paidin capital when utilized the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire if not utilized in 2011 through 2027 most state research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized 

  

the tax reform act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code we experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50 percent in 2003 and 2002 these changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize certain us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 2329 million and 1165 million respectively losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward but are subject to the expiration dates described above 

  

deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the amount of such earnings at december 31 2007 was 2595 million principally from verisign japan kk and verisign switzerland sa these earnings have been permanently reinvested and verisign does not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the undistributed foreign earnings 

  

we are currently under examination by the irs and the california franchise tax board for the years ended december 31 2004 and december 31 2005 we are also under examination by numerous state taxing jurisdictions because we use historic net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset our taxable income in current and future years such attributes can be adjusted by the irs and other taxing authorities until the statute closes on the year in which such attribute was utilized 

  

  

  

loss from unconsolidated entities net of tax 

  

loss from unconsolidated entities net of tax represents the net loss recognized from the joint ventures entered into with fox as described in note 2 “joint ventures” of our notes to consolidated financial statements we recorded a loss net of tax of approximately 20 million in 2007 

  

minority interest net of tax 

  

minority interest net of tax represents the portion of net income belonging to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the following table presents a comparison of minority interest net of tax 

  

   

2007 compared to 2006 minority interest net of tax increased primarily from an increase in net income from our verisign japan subsidiary primarily due to an increase in security services revenues 

  

2006 compared to 2005 minority interest net of tax decreased primarily from decreased net income from our verisign japan subsidiary primarily due to a decrease in the installed base of ssl certificates and a decrease in demand for managed security services in japan 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

at december 31 2007 our principal source of liquidity was 14 billion of cash and cash equivalents consisting principally of money market funds 

  

in january 2007 we entered into two joint venture agreements with fox to provide mobile entertainment to consumers on a global basis under the terms of the agreements fox owns a 51 interest and verisign owns a 49 interest in the joint ventures fox paid verisign approximately 1924 million in cash for the divestiture of 51 of our ownership interest in jamba and we paid fox approximately 49 million in cash for its contribution of fox mobile entertainment assets 

  

in august 2007 we issued 125 billion principal amount of 325 convertible debentures due 2037 to an initial purchaser in a private offering we received net proceeds of 122 billion after deduction of issuance costs of 258 million concurrently with the issuance of the convertible debentures the board of directors of verisign authorized the use of the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures to repurchase shares of our common stock in addition to the previously approved 2006 stock repurchase program 

  

  

during the second half of 2007 we divested certain businesses for 192 million in cash and 38 million in preferred stock of one of the acquiring companies and recorded a net gain of 44 million 

  

during the second half of 2007 we used the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures to repurchase 122 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately 350 million additionally we entered into a 200 million guaranteed share repurchase “gsr” agreement and a 600 million asr agreement with two independent financial institutions under the terms of the gsr agreement we received approximately 63 million shares of our common stock under the terms of the asr agreement we received approximately 195 million shares 

  

in january and february of 2008 we repurchased 133 million shares of our common stock under the 2006 stock repurchase program for an aggregate cost of 4514 million as of february 28 we have approximately 5327 million available under the 2006 stock repurchase program 

  

on january 31 2008 our board of directors authorized the 2008 stock repurchase program having an aggregate purchase price of up to 600 million of our common stock 

  

on february 8 2008 we announced that we entered into an asr agreement to repurchase 600 million of our common stock under the 2008 stock repurchase program and announced an intent to repurchase up to an additional 200 million in open market transactions under the 2006 stock repurchase program we paid 600 million to a financial institution in exchange for a number of shares which will be determined subject to a cap based on market prices during the term of the asr agreement through february 28 2008 we received 151 million shares under the asr agreement we expect to complete the repurchases by the end of the third quarter of 2008 although in certain circumstances the completion date may be shortened or extended 

  

as a result of the companys decision to divest its noncore businesses we expect cash flows from investing activities to increase in 2008 as and when proceeds are received from the sale of those businesses we continue to expect positive cash flows from operating activities as our core businesses generate the majority of our cash flows from operations 

  

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

  

   

net cash provided by operating activities 

  

our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes and facilities 

  

2007 compared to 2006 net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to 1395 million in net loss adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities the noncash items contributing to the increase primarily included an increase in restructuring impairments and other charges reversals net primarily associated with our 2007 restructuring plan an increase in stockbased compensation expense primarily due to acceleration of stock options and awards related to the separation of our former chief executive officer a charge for impairment of goodwill realized and unrealized losses on our embedded 

  

  

derivative associated with our issuance of convertible debentures and a change in deferred income taxes primarily due to a release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in 2006 the noncash items partially offsetting the increase included gain from our divestiture of our majority ownership interest in jamba gains from the divestitures of certain other business units and an unrealized gain on joint venture call options the changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to timing of receipts purchases and payments 

  

2006 compared to 2005 net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities the noncash items contributing to the decrease included a change in deferred income taxes primarily due to a release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r the changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to timing of receipts purchases and payments 

  

net cash provided by used in investing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to business combinations divestiture of businesses timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment investments in unconsolidated entities and longterm note receivable 

  

2007 compared to 2006 net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to proceeds received on divestiture of our majority ownership interest in jamba and certain other businesses partially offset by a decrease in cash spent on business combinations and for purchases of investments and a decrease in cash received from maturities and sales of investments 

  

2006 compared to 2005 net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash spent on business combinations and for purchases of investments partially offset by an increase in cash received from maturities and sales of investments 

  

net cash provided by used in financing activities 

  

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations as well as stock repurchase and stock option exercise activities 

  

2007 compared to 2006 net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to proceeds received from issuance of convertible debentures and an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases partially offset by an increase in cash spent for stock repurchase activities and repayment of shortterm debt under the credit facility 

  

2006 compared to 2005 net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to proceeds received from drawdown of the credit facility partially offset by a decrease in cash spent for stock repurchase activities and for repayment of shortterm debt under the credit facility 

  

as of december 31 2007 restricted cash and investments primarily include 450 million related to a trust established during 2004 for our director and officer liability selfinsurance coverage 

  

as of december 31 2007 we have pledged approximately 25 million as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements the longest of which is expected to mature in 2014 of the 25 million pledged as of december 31 2007 approximately 20 million is classified as shortterm restricted cash and is included in cash and cash equivalents in january 2008 the collateral associated with standby letters of credit was released 

  

in 2006 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions related to a 5000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “facility” under which verisign or certain 

  

  

designated subsidiaries may be borrowers as of december 31 2007 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility any future borrowings under the facility will be used for working capital capital expenditures permitted acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock and other lawful corporate purposes 

  

we believe existing cash and cash equivalents together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure requirements and to service our debt for the next 12 months our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses acquisitions and share repurchases we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

  

property and equipment expenditures 

  

the following table shows our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2008 and our actual expenditures in 2007 2006 and 2005 

  

   

our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2008 are anticipated to be approximately 1600 million and will primarily be focused on productivity cost improvement and market development initiatives for the internet services group 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant noncancelable contractual obligations at december 31 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

  

   

as of december 31 2007 we had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2017 see note 15 “commitments and contingencies” of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we enter into certain purchase obligations with various vendors our significant purchase obligations primarily consist of firm commitments with telecommunication carriers and other service providers we do not have any significant purchase obligations beyond 2010 

  

in 2006 we entered into a contractual agreement with icann to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the  com toplevel domain through november 30 2012 under the new agreement we paid icann fixed registry level fees of 100 million during 2007 beginning in 2009 the agreement provides for contingent payments upon meeting certain criteria based on growth in annual domain name registrations that could amount to an additional 205 million through the end of the contract 

  

  

in august 2007 we issued 125 billion principal amount of 325 debentures due 2037 we will pay cash interest at an annual rate of 325 payable semiannually on february 15 and august 15 of each year until maturity see note 10 “junior subordinated debentures” of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “sfas 160” “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” which requires all entities to report minority interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements and requires that transactions between entities and noncontrolling interests be treated as equity sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and will be applied prospectively we are currently evaluating the effect of sfas 160 and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “sfas 141r” “ business combinations ” which will significantly change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods some of the changes such as the accounting for contingent consideration will introduce more volatility into earnings and may impact a companys acquisition strategy sfas 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and will be applied prospectively we are currently evaluating the effect of sfas 141r and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “sfas 159” “ the fair value option for financial assets or financial liabilities ” which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value the objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently sfas 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after november 15 2007 early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 157 “sfas 157” “ fair value measurements ” we do not expect the adoption of sfas 159 to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 which defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 on february 12 2008 the fasb issued fsp sfas 1572 “ effective date of fasb statement no 157 ” which defers the effective date for adoption of fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 157 to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

interest rate sensitivity 

  

the primary objective of our shortterm investment management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving aftertax returns we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities we invest in a variety of securities including commercial paper mediumterm notes corporate bonds and notes us government and agency securities and money market funds in general money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate as of december 31 2007 our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and we did not have any fixed income marketable securities 

  

  

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks in the fourth quarter of 2003 we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months 

  

at december 31 2007 we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately 509 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with highquality financial institutions 

  

market risk management 

  

the fair market value of the junior subordinated convertible debentures the “debentures” issued by the company and due august 2037 is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair market value of the debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price falls the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the debentures but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations as of december 31 2007 the fair value of the debentures was approximately 16 billion based on quoted market prices

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” as of december 31 2007 we determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below notwithstanding the material weakness discussed below our management based upon the substantial work performed during the preparation of this report has concluded that information included in this form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that information we are required to disclose in this form 10k under the exchange act was accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 using the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis based on our evaluation under the coso framework management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 arising from the following control deficiencies in the company’s stock administration policies and practices 

  

   

   

accordingly we concluded that the control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls 

  

as a result of the material weakness described above management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by coso 

  

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 see “report of independent registered public accounting firm” in item 15 of this form 10k 

  

  

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

2008 remediation plan 

  

subsequent to december 31 2007 our board of directors approved additional internal control policies and procedures intended to remediate the material weakness described above as of the date of this filing management is in the process of implementing the following corrective actions 

  

   

   

   

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the three months ended december 31 2007 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

d inherent limitations of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting 

  

because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent material errors or fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the continued effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to risks including that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate

role of the compensation committee  the compensation committee of our board of directors “committee” is ultimately responsible for the oversight of our compensation and benefit programs and sets the policies governing compensation of our executive officers and our other employees as part of this process the committee annually reviews and approves all elements of our executive compensation program including the annual incentive bonus program and longterm incentive compensation programs for our nonofficer employees 

  

compensation decisions are made by the committee after reviewing the performance of the company and each executive’s performance during the year against established goals current compensation arrangements market trends and the compensation history of the executive officer relative to the other executives 

  

role of management  the ceo annually reviews the performance of each executive officer other than the ceo whose performance is reviewed by the chairman and the committee and makes a recommendation regarding the salary incentive bonus and longterm incentive compensation for each executive officer other than himself based on his assessment of the performance of each individual the ceo also takes an active part in the discussions at committee meetings at which the compensation of executives who report to him directly including the named executive officers is discussed all decisions regarding the ceo’s compensation are made by the committee in executive session without the ceo present 

  

role of compensation consultant  compensia inc a recognized management consulting firm “compensia” served as independent consultant to the compensation committee during the first half of 2007 to 

  

  

assist it in evaluating and analyzing the company’s executive compensation program principles and objectives as well as the specific compensation and benefit design recommendations presented by the company’s executive management 

  

in may 2007 the committee engaged frederick w cook  co “fw cook” to serve as its independent compensation consultant fw cook reports directly to the committee and assists in evaluating and analyzing our executive compensation program principles and objectives as well as the specific compensation and benefit design recommendations presented by our executive management fw cook does not perform any other services for us other than its consulting services to the committee 

  

benchmarking  we use a benchmarking process to help determine base salary annual incentive bonus and longterm incentive compensation targets for our executive officers we undertake an annual study of competitive compensation practices for executive officers at certain high technology companies that we view as our peers or as competitors for talent 

  

the committee targets total cash compensation base salary and annual incentive bonus for each named executive officer at a percentile between the 50th and 75th percentile of the compensation peer group longterm incentive compensation is targeted at the 75th percentile of the compensation peer group adjustments to total compensation are made based on the executive’s individual performance in the prior year relative to his peers the executive’s future potential with us and the scope of the executive’s responsibilities and experience the compensation committee believes that setting base salary bonus and longterm incentive compensation targets at these levels is necessary in order to effectively attract retain and motivate talented executives other elements of compensation including health and welfare benefits and severance and change in control payments and benefits are reviewed periodically by the compensation committee to ensure that our total compensation is competitive based on data obtained from various sources at the time of the review 

  

our compensation peer group is principally made up of publiclytraded companies in the high technology sector that are either business competitors andor with which we compete for executive talent the peer group is comparable to us with regard to labor market competition market capitalization revenue and number of employees the peer group is reviewed annually and adjustments are made as necessary to ensure the group continues to appropriately reflect the competitive market for key talent and includes companies similar to us in scope and complexity 

  

the committee determined that the compensation peer group for 2007 would consist of the following fifteen companies adobe systems inc akamai technologies inc autodesk bea systems inc bmc software inc business objects sa cadence design systems inc citrix systems inc convergys corporation electronic arts inc intuit inc juniper networks inc mcafee inc network appliance inc and symantec corp 

  

range of revenues and market cap for 2007 peer group 

  

   

equity award practices except for equity awards made in connection with new hires and promotions equity awards to executive officers and other employees are generally made annually on the date of the compensation committee meeting held in august each year the committee must approve all new hire and promotion grants to section 16 executive officers 

  

  

elements of compensation program 

  

base salary  base salary is the primary fixed component of our compensation program and is intended to provide a guaranteed level of annual income to our executives we believe that offering a competitive annual base salary that is not subject to risk for performance is vital in attracting and retaining our executives 

  

base salaries of our executive officers are determined annually actual base salary levels are established based upon each executive officer’s job responsibilities and experience individual contributions and future potential with reference to base salary levels of executives at other high technology companies we view as our peers as described above we target a percentile above the median as determined by a benchmarking analysis in setting the total cash compensation base salary and annual incentive bonus for each executive officer however the compensation committee is mindful of the effects that any changes to base salary can have on other elements of our compensation program such as target bonus amounts and potential severance payments and carefully considers these factors when setting or changing executive base salaries 

  

during the course of 2007 the committee approved base salary adjustments for several of our senior executive officers including some of the named executive officers the adjustments were made after the committee reviewed competitive benchmark data provided by compensia and by fw cook and recommendations from the ceo regarding each executive’s individual performance the committee determined that the resulting salary levels were between the competitive median and 75 th percentile 

  

   

the salary rate for mr roper reflects his base salary when he was hired as verisign’s president chief executive officer and director on may 27 2007 mr clement received a base salary increase on january 27 2007 bringing his salary from 290000 to 305000 on july 12 2007 mr clement was appointed to the position of chief financial officer and his salary was increased upon his promotion to 375000 messrs balogh and korzeniewski received increases to base salaries effective may 1 2007 mr donovan’s base salary reflects his salary rate when he was hired on december 1 2006 and there were no other increases to his salary in 2007 

  

annual incentive bonus  we have established the verisign performance plan “vpp” an annual cash bonus plan that is designed to reward members of the executive team and other employees for their contributions in helping us achieve financial operating and other goals the plan provides participants with the opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus based on our performance compared against preestablished financial individual or strategic goals target bonus levels for our executive officers are established in part by reference to bonus levels of executives at other high technology companies we view as our peers as determined by our benchmarking analysis 

  

in 2007 the performance measures for the vpp were consolidated company operating income and operating cash flow as adjusted with each goal being equally weighted the adjusted measures exclude the following items which are included under gaap operating income amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill acquired inprocess research and development stockbased compensation former ceo severance nonrecurring costs and settlements restructuring impairments and other charges reversals net gain or loss on 

  

  

the sale or impairment of investments gain or loss on the sale of a subsidiary unrealized gain on jamba jv call option realized and unrealized gains and losses on embedded derivative and stock option investigation costs these goals represented a change from the previous year when revenues and as adjusted operating income were used the committee changed the goals for 2007 because of the changes in our strategic plan in 2007 as the committee believed that changing the revenue goal to operating cash flow goal as adjusted would be a more appropriate performance measure for the company the goals for 2007 were reviewed by the compensation committee in february and may of 2007 however due to a strategic review of business operations the compensation committee deferred final approval of the metrics and goals for 2007 until approved in november 2007 

  

for the 2007 vpp bonuses the committee established target levels of performance for each metric equal to 450 million for operating cash flow and 354 million for operating income actual funding for payouts was determined by the company’s average achievement as a percent of target for the two goals no payments would be provided for achievement at or below 80 of target while achievement at or above 120 of the target goals could result in payment of 150 of each executive’s target bonus for 2007 the committee determined that the company achieved 103 of the operating cash flow target and 93 of the operating income target for a combined average result of 98 of target this achievement of 98 of the targeted performance resulted in the bonus funded at 90 of targeted dollars based on the schedule approved by the committee 

  

bonus targets for the named executive officers are set at 60 of base salary except for mr roper whose bonus target is set at 100 of base salary bonuses to executives are prorated from date of hire or from assignment to executive officer position or as in the case of former executives per their severance arrangement at the compensation committee meeting held on february 19 2008 the committee approved bonus payments to named executive officers for the following amounts mr roper 405000 mr clement 134000 mr donovan 243000 mr balogh 116640 mr korzeniewski 121500 ms evan 117936 and mr mclaughlin 145800 in determining the final payments the committee took into account the performance results of the vpp and assessment of the individual performance of each of the executives 

  

discretionary bonus  in 2007 a special discretionary bonus plan was implemented to reward certain employees for work in connection with the company’s restatement of its financial statements for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 which was completed in july 2007 payments under the special discretionary bonus plan were made in two parts based on successful completion of project milestones mr clement participated in this special discretionary bonus plan and received bonus payments of 60444 and 40206 on may 25 2007 and july 20 2007 respectively 

  

longterm incentive compensation  equitybased grants are an important element of our total compensation program and are designed to support our payforperformance philosophy by providing a direct link between employee rewards and increased stockholder value longterm incentive award amounts are established based upon each executive officer’s job responsibilities and experience individual contributions and future potential with reference to longterm incentive award levels of executives at our peers as determined by our benchmarking analysis 

  

for 2007 longterm incentive compensation was targeted at the 75th percentile of the compensation peer group however a number of other factors were also considered including the individual’s expected contribution to our future success the individual’s past performance and the number of unvested stock options and restricted stock units held by the individual 

  

the committee approved a change in award value mix for equity awards granted to vice presidents and executives including the named executive officers in 2007 50 of the total award value was granted in the form of nonqualified stock options and 50 of the total award value was granted in the form of performance restricted stock units “performance rsus” in prior years the mix was 75 stock options and 25 timevesting rsus this change to emphasize restricted stock units over stock options was made to provide additional retention value for senior leaders due to the changes occurring in the company during 2007 

  

  

stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and typically vest over a fouryear period with 25 of the option shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and the remaining option shares vesting ratably each quarter thereafter until fully vested 

  

the committee awarded performance rsus to certain senior officers in 2007 including the named executive officers 100 of the target number of performance rsus awarded to each executive will vest on the third anniversary of grant if during any sixty 60 consecutive trading days prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant the average closing price of the company’s common stock equals or exceeds a stock price target of 3978 as reported by the nasdaq global select market if we do not achieve the stock price target by the third anniversary of grant 50 of the target number of performance rsus will vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining 50 of performance rsus will be forfeited vesting in all cases is subject to the recipient’s continued employment with the company 

  

stock options and restricted stock units were granted on august 7 2007 at the regularly scheduled compensation committee meeting the grant price for stock options was 2963 which was the closing selling price per share of verisign’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market on august 7 2007 the below table details the equity grants awarded to named executive officers excluding mr roper whose equity grants are discussed in the section titled ceo compensation 

  

   

at its meeting held on february 19 2008 the committee approved a grant of 10000 restricted stock units to mr clement this was a discretionary retentive grant award acknowledging mr clement’s role in the transformation of the company in 2008 and beyond onethird of this grant will vest two years from anniversary date of grant onethird will vest on the third anniversary from date of grant and onethird will vest on the fourth anniversary from date of grant 

  

the committee believes that both stock options and performance rsus accomplish our goal of linking executive compensation to increases in stockholder value stock options only have value to the recipient if the company’s share price increases from the date of grant in addition the performancerestricted stock units provide immediate retention value to our executives while still maintaining a strong incentive to increase the company’s share price 

  

ceo compensation    mr roper was hired as the company’s new chief executive officer on may 27 2007 his newhire base salary was established at 750000 per year for 2007 mr roper was eligible for the vpp bonus at a target of 100 of his base salary prorated from his date of hire his maximum bonus potential is no greater than 200 of base salary mr roper’s base salary and bonus target were positioned at the median of our competitive peer group 

  

the longterm incentive component of mr roper’s newhire compensation package consisted of both stock options and restricted stock units he received a newhire signon nonqualified stock option to acquire 158227 

  

  

shares of verisign’s common stock this signon option vests in equal installments on each quarterly anniversary date of grant of the signon option over the three years from the date of grant provided that mr roper remains continually employed by verisign at all times during the relevant quarter mr roper also received a newhire signon restricted stock unit “rsu” award with respect to 110375 shares of verisign’s common stock the signon rsu award vests in equal installments on each quarterly anniversary of the date of grant of the signon rsu award over three years from date of grant provided he remain continuously employed by verisign at all times during the relevant quarter 

  

mr roper also received a nonqualified stock option award to acquire 210970 shares of verisign’s common stock the option vests in equal installments on each quarterly anniversary of the date of grant of the firstyear option over the three years from the date of grant 

  

a performance rsu award with respect to 88300 shares was also granted to mr roper this performance rsu shall vest upon meeting the terms described above for performance rsus 

  

mr roper’s signon and equity awards were granted on august 7 2007 his stock option awards were granted at an exercise price of 2963 per share which represents the closing selling price per share of verisign’s common stock on the nasdaq global select market on the grant date the signon grant amounts were established as a buyout of previously forfeited equity compensation from mr roper’s prior employer his other equity grants were established at the market median of our peer group 

  

benefits  executive officers like other employees participate in a number of benefit programs designed to enable us to attract and retain employees in a competitive marketplace we provide executive officers the same health and welfare benefits provided generally to all other employees at the same general premium rates charged to such employees with the exception of the group voluntary universal life insurance benefit the benefits include medical dental and vision insurance and other health benefits fitness club reimbursement up to 390 per year paid time off an employee stock purchase plan and a qualified 401k salary deferral plan the group voluntary universal life insurance benefit is open to all usbased employees with an annual salary of 110000 or greater and provides two times salary in basic life insurance as well as the opportunity to purchase additional life insurance 

  

other than those benefits described above we provide no additional or supplemental benefits such as a company automobile club memberships deferred compensation programs or retirement benefits to our executive officers 

  

total compensation  we believe we are fulfilling our compensation objectives and rewarding executive officers in a manner that is consistent with our payforperformance philosophy executive compensation is tied directly to our performance and is structured to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between our longterm and shortterm performance and also provides a balance between our operational performance and stockholder return for the named executive officers as of the end of 2007 the aggregate total compensation mix represented 10 base salaries 5 bonus and 85 longterm incentives 

  

share ownership guidelines 

  

in addition to aligning interests between executives and stockholders through stock options and restricted stock units the board of directors adopted a stock ownership policy that requires executive officers to own shares of verisign common stock executive officers are required to own verisign common stock in an amount not less than three times their annual base salary calculated using the executive’s 2005 base salary for individuals who were executive officer at the time of the policy’s adoption or for officers appointed after the policy’s adoption the executive’s initial base salary at the time the individual was appointed as an executive officer company stock that counts toward satisfaction of these stock ownership guidelines includes shares owned outright by the officer and his or her immediate family members who share the same household whether 

  

  

held individually or jointly restricted stock where restrictions have lapsed shares acquired and held upon stock option exercises and shares obtained through open market purchases shares held in trust may also be included subject to the approval of the chairman of the board of directors each executive officer has five years from the later of the date of the adoption of the requirement or of the individual becoming an executive officer to attain the minimum level of ownership the stock ownership policy is included in verisign’s corporate governance principles which can be found on our website at httpinvestorverisigncomgovernancecfm  

  

because we grant stockbased incentive in order to align the interests of its employees with those of its stockholders our securities trading policy forbids executive officers and other employees from buying or selling derivative securities related to verisign common stock such as puts or calls on verisign common stock as derivative securities may diminish the alignment that we are trying to foster companyissued stock options and restricted stock units are not transferable during the executive officer’s life other than certain gifts to family members or trusts partnerships etc that benefit family members 

  

severance agreements 

  

we do not have a formal severance program for our executive officers all of whom are atwill employees we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and employment offers generally do not provide for severance or other benefits following termination 

  

change in control severance agreements 

  

in august 2007 we entered into change in control severance agreements with our section 16 officers including the named executive officers the agreements provide for certain severance benefits in the event an executive’s employment is terminated in connection with a change in control of the company all of the agreements are “double trigger” agreements meaning that executives will only be eligible for benefits under the agreements if both i a change in control of the company occurs and ii within twentyfour months of the change in control the executive’s employment is terminated by the company without cause or by the executive for good reason in connection with the change in control the committee believes that the change in control severance agreements are necessary to attract and retain highly qualified executives and to neutralize the personal interests of our executives in light of any potential beneficial corporate transaction the compensation committee determined the change in control severance agreements were reasonable when compared to competitive peer group practice 

  

separation agreements with former executives 

  

the employment of several of our senior executives was terminated employment with us in 2007 and we entered into separation agreements with some of these executives the separation agreements generally provide for severance payments and in some cases equity award vesting acceleration and extension of posttermination exercise periods detailed descriptions of these separation agreements and related severance payments can be found in the narrative that follows and section titled grants of planbased awards for fiscal 2007 

  

retirement of former executive 

  

on december 31 2007 mr korzeniewski retired from the company mr korzeniewski is eligible to receive up to his full target bonus for 2007 of 225000 subject to the approval of the compensation committee of the board of directors and pursuant to the terms of the 2007 vpp at its meeting on february 19 2008 the compensation committee approved a bonus of 121500 for mr korzeniewski based on individual performance and the performance of the company in fiscal year 2007 pursuant to the terms of the 2007 vpp 

  

tax treatment of executive compensation 

  

in determining the amount and form of compensation paid each year to its executive officers we take into account the tax treatment of such compensation 

  

  

section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended limits the federal income tax deduction for compensation paid to each named executive officer other than the company’s chief financial officer to 1000000 per year for public companies unless the compensation is performancebased our executive compensation is structured to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by the company when in its judgment it is appropriate and in the interest of the company and its stockholders the deductibility of an executive officer’s compensation can depend upon the timing of the executive officer’s vesting or exercise of previously granted rights as well as other factors beyond the company’s control therefore an executive officer’s compensation is not necessarily limited to that which is deductible under section 162m the committee may approve payment of compensation that exceeds the deductibility limitation under section 162m in order to meet compensation objectives or if it determines that doing so is otherwise in the interest of our stockholders certain restricted stock units awarded in 2007 are not performance based and therefore not exempt from the limitation of deductibility under 162m

principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as rsa security and entrust technologies which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as geotrust and digital signature trust company a subsidiary of identrus that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authority or ca related services and 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as cybertrust we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore netscape and microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products 

  

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future 

  

competition in managed security services  consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services these companies include large systems integrators and consulting firms such as accenture ibm global services getronics and lucent netcare we also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services such as symantec and iss as well as a number of providers such as cybertrust and counterpane that offer managed security services exclusively telecommunications providers such as mci that acquired netsec provide managed security services and are competitors in addition we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of ip addresses and name maps throughout enterprisewide intranets and with companies with internally developed systems integration efforts 

  

competition in communications services the market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure competition in this area arises from two primary sources incumbent carriers provide competing inhouse services in their respective regions in addition we face direct competition from national unregulated companies including syniverse technologies telcordia neustar and other carriers such as southern new england telephone diversified group a unit of att furthermore customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as verisign and further increase competitive pricing pressures 

  

competition in commerce services our wireless billing and payment services also are subject to competition from providers such as comverse amdocs convergys corporation and boston communications group we are also aware of major internet service providers software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are or may in the future be focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that may compete directly with ours furthermore customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as verisign and further increase competitive pricing pressures

competition in digital brand management services we face competition from companies providing services similar to some of our digital brand management services in the monitoring services registration and domain name asset management area of our business our competition comes primarily from icann accredited registrars and various smaller companies providing similar services 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished 

  

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

industry regulation 

  

information services within the us government leadership for the continued privatization of internet administration is currently provided by the department of commerce 

  

on november 10 1999 we entered into a series of wideranging agreements these agreements included the following 

  

   

   

   

   

  

our registry agreement with icann was replaced by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com  one for net and one for org  the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007 with a 4year renewal option the net registry services were subject to a competitive bidding process administered by icann our bid was determined by the outside evaluators selected by icann to be the top bid and verisign and icann have executed a new net registry agreement that extends until september 30 2011 the org registry agreement terminated on december 31 2002 and the org registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by icann during 2003

security services some of our security services utilize and incorporate encryption technology exports of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the united states and various nonunited states governments we have obtained approval to export many of the security services we provide to customers globally under applicable united states export law including our server digital certificate services as the list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or changed government restrictions on the export of software and hardware products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell some of our security services in international markets 

  

there are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certification authorities but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to certification authorities if we do not comply with these state laws and regulations we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us moreover if our market for digital certificates grows the united states federal state or foreign governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certification authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services these regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

communications services one service provided by the communications services group is currently subject to federal communications commission “fcc” regulation this service allows wireless users who are “roaming” in areas where their home carrier has not made arrangements for automatic roaming service to complete calls to domestic and international destinations the communications services group has been authorized by the fcc to provide this service further our communications customers are subject to fcc regulation which indirectly affects our communications services business we cannot predict when or upon what terms and conditions further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or deregulation on our business several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services which may increase our costs of operations in addition future services we may provide could be subject to direct government regulation 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the united states and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices the national or international patent offices may not award any patents with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded they may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property

we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be good our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions 

  

adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to downturns in the telecommunications and technology industries in the past and could impact our business in the future resulting in 

  

   

   

   

recent political turmoil in many parts of the world including terrorist and military actions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not continue to improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

  

our limited operating history under our current business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results 

  

we have acquired many companies a number of which operated in different businesses from our thencurrent business therefore we have only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects our success will depend on many factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

to address these risks we must among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we have faced difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with acquisitions 

  

we made several acquisitions in the last five years and will pursue additional acquisitions in the future we have experienced difficulty in and in the future may face difficulties integrating the personnel products technologies or operations of companies we acquire assimilating acquired businesses involves a number of other risks including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future acquisitions our business could be harmed 

  

additionally there is risk that we may incur additional expenses associated with an impairment of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions for acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and to evaluate other intangible assets as events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired these evaluations could result in further impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

  

  

the expansion of our international operations subjects our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

international revenues accounted for approximately 37 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 we intend to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities for example we expect to expand our operations and marketing activities throughout asia europe latin america and south america we currently have facilities and over 550 employees in germany expansion in these international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our other services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets failure to do so could harm our business in addition there are risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our failure to manage past and future growth in our business could harm our business 

  

between december 31 1995 and december 31 2005 we grew from 26 to 4076 employees this was achieved through internal growth as well as acquisitions during this time period we opened new sales offices and significantly expanded our us and nonus operations to successfully manage past growth and any future growth we will need to continue to implement additional management information systems continue the development of our operating administrative financial and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our executive engineering accounting finance marketing sales and operations organizations any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business

our future growth in our communications services business depends in part on the commercial success and reliability of our ss7 network our ss7 network is a vital component of our intelligent network services and has been a significant source of revenues for our communications services group our communications services business will suffer if our target customers do not use our ss7 network our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced ss7based services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our particular ss7 network solution or continue to use our ss7 network in the future we may not be successful in marketing our ss7 network or any new or enhanced services 

  

the inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our business 

  

significant technical challenges exist in our signaling and network services business because many of our customers 

  

   

   

   

customer implementation currently requires participation by our order management and our engineering and operations groups each of which has limited resources some customers may also require us to develop costly customized features or capabilities which increase our costs and consume a disproportionate share of our limited customer service and support resources also we typically charge onetime flat rate fees for initially connecting a customer to our ss7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the connection is established if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our engineering service support we may experience reduced operating margins our customers’ ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and integrate them successfully within their systems depends on our customers’ capabilities and the complexity involved difficulty in deploying those services could reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause potential delays in recognizing revenues until the services are implemented 

  

our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our communications services at desired pricing levels and industry consolidation could adversely impact our revenues and cash flow 

  

the telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price competition competition and industry consolidation in our communications services could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion in our market share pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in the selling price of our services for example our competitors may provide customers with reduced communications costs for internet access or private network services reducing the overall cost of services and significantly increasing pricing pressures on us we would need to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of our customers generating higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs and we may not be able to do so successfully we believe that the business of providing network connectivity and related network services will see increased consolidation in the future consolidation could decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries which could erode our market share revenues and operating margins in our communications services group consolidation in the telecommunications industry has led to the merging of many companies including att wireless mci nextel and price communications customers of our communications services group our business could be harmed if these mergers result in the loss of customers 

  

  

by our communications services group furthermore customers may choose to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services thereby reducing the demand for technologies and services we offer which could harm our business 

  

our content services business depends on agreements with many different third parties including wireless carriers and content providers if these agreements are terminated or not renewed or are amended to require us to change the way our content services are offered to customers our business could be harmed 

  

our content services business depends on our ability to enter into and maintain agreements with many different third parties including 

  

   

   

these agreements are typically for a short term or are otherwise terminable upon short notice and in the case of agreements with carriers other mobile phone service providers and content developers are nonexclusive if these third parties reduce their commitment to us terminate their agreements with us or enter into similar agreements with our competitors our content services business could be materially harmed for example because we depend on wireless carriers to bill customers for our services a loss of any of these relationships or our failure to enter into new relationships with additional wireless carriers on commercially reasonable terms could prevent us from billing and receiving revenues from existing and new customers 

  

some wireless carriers have implemented more detailed enrollment procedures before their customers can purchase content services such as those we offer similar enrollment procedures or other requirements affecting content services may be adopted by other wireless carriers or by trade associations seeking to establish industrywide standards and could adversely affect subscriber growth and renewal rates in our content services business 

  

our content services business is dependent on third parties offering attractive content and technology on acceptable terms 

  

only some of the content used in our content services business is developed internally we also receive content such as ringtones games and logos from third parties if the market for mobile entertainment and information continues to grow content providers might try to raise their prices some providers insist on charging fixed fees for their content regardless of revenues so if we fail to achieve anticipated revenues we would achieve lower margins for our content services there is no assurance that we will be able to timely purchase content having the requisite quality in the future and on commercially reasonable terms should we be unable to acquire attractive content from third parties and on acceptable terms this could adversely affect our content services business 

  

our customer subscription agreements for our content services are typically cancelable and our business could be harmed if we fail to retain current customers or if we fail to obtain significant numbers of new customers to replace customers who cancel or fail to renew 

  

our content services are typically sold as fixed weekly or monthly subscriptions our customers for these services may cancel their subscriptions for our service at the end of each service period and in fact many customers elect to do so we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates our customers’ subscription and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with the service pricing pressure changes in preferences and trends competitive services adverse coverage in the news media changes in the way we advertise our services or other reasons if our customers cancel or fail to renew their subscriptions for our content services or if we fail to obtain significant numbers of new customers to replace customers who cancel or fail to renew our revenue could decline and our content services business will suffer 

  

  

our business depends on the continued growth of the internet and adoption and continued use of ip networks 

  

our future success depends in part on continued growth in the use of the internet and ip networks if the use of and interest in the internet and ip networks does not grow our business would be harmed to date many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the internet and ip networks for a number of reasons including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the widespread acceptance of the internet and ip networks will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging information organizations that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods also individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting payments may be reluctant to change 

  

a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering various initiatives that could permit sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives are adopted it could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and therefore hinder the growth in the use of the internet and ip networks which could harm our business 

  

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could suffer 

  

we target our security services at the market for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks our communications services group is targeting the consumer market for content services our information services business unit is developing managed services designed to work with the epcglobal network and radio frequency identification “rfid” technology pointofsale data services and realtime publisher services these are rapidly evolving markets that may not continue to grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services is very uncertain the factors that may affect market acceptance of our services include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

if the market for electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business would be materially harmed 

  

governmental regulation and the application of existing laws may slow business growth increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

  

the growth and development of the internet has led to new laws and regulations as well as the application of existing laws to the internet and wireless communications application of these laws can be unclear the costs of complying or failure to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our markets expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and timeconsuming litigation 

  

foreign federal or state laws could have an adverse impact on our business for example recent laws include those designed to restrict the online distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions or obligations for online services when dealing with minors such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 

  

due to the nature of the internet it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate internet transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws we might unintentionally violate such laws such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future any such developments could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us force us to change our business practices or otherwise materially harm our business 

  

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

  

the emerging nature of the internet other communication networks content digital certificate and domain name registration markets and their rapid evolution require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings in particular the market for entertainment and information is characterized by changing technology developing industry standards changing customer preferences and trends which also vary from country to country and the constant introduction of new products and services in order to remain competitive we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and customer preferences when entertainment products are placed on the market it is difficult to predict whether they will become popular 

  

the communications network services industry is also characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements significant technological changes could make our technologies obsolete and other changes in our markets particularly content could result in some of our other products and services losing market share accordingly we must continually improve the responsiveness reliability and features of our services and develop new features services and applications to meet changing customer needs in our target markets for example we sell our ss7 network services primarily to traditional telecommunications companies that rely on traditional voice networks many emerging companies are providing convergent internet protocolbased network services our future success could also depend upon our ability to provide products and services to these internet protocolbased telephony providers particularly if ipbased telephony becomes widely accepted we cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a costeffective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

  

new products and services developed or introduced by us may not result in any significant revenues 

  

we must commit significant resources to develop new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept the success of new products and services 

  

  

depends on several factors including proper new definition and timely completion introduction and market acceptance for example our selection in january 2004 by epcglobal a notforprofit standards organization to operate the object naming service as the root directory for the epcglobal network may not increase our revenues in the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunities develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products services and technologies developed by others will not render our products services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our inability to successfully market new products and services may harm our business 

  

issues arising from our agreements with icann and the department of commerce could harm our registry business 

  

the department of commerce or doc has adopted a plan for a phased transition of the doc’s responsibilities for the domain name system to the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers or icann as part of this transition our registry agreement with icann was replaced by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com  one for net and one for org  the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007 with a 4year renewal option the net registry services were subject to a competitive bidding process administered by icann our bid was determined by the outside evaluators selected by icann to be the top bid and verisign and icann have executed a new net registry agreement that extends until september 30 2011 the org registry agreement terminated on december 31 2002 and the org registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by icann during 2003 we face risks from this transition to icann which include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

on august 27 2004 we filed a lawsuit against icann in the superior court of the state of california county of los angeles the lawsuit alleges that icann overstepped its contractual authority and improperly attempted to regulate our business in violation of icann’s charter and its agreements with us we cannot predict the effect this lawsuit will have on our relationship with icann 

  

  

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our domain name registry business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including other domestic and foreign governmental authorities to our role in the ongoing privatization of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of these challenges it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our domain name registry business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted 

  

if we encounter system interruptions we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in mountain view california and kawasaki japan both of which are susceptible to earthquakes providence rhode island dulles virginia lacey washington overland park kansas melbourne australia and berlin hamburg and verl germany any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business 

  

in addition our ability to issue digital certificates our domain name registry services and other of our services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past 

  

a failure in the operation of our domain name zone servers the domain name root servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction which could harm our business 

  

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system the root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure 

  

despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our services such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

the reliance of our network connectivity and interoperability services and content services on thirdparty communications infrastructure hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control 

  

the success of our network connectivity and interoperability services and content services depends on our network infrastructure including the capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers in particular we rely on att mci sprint and other telecommunications providers for leased longhaul and local loop transmission capacity these companies provide the dedicated links that connect our network components to each other and to our customers our business also depends upon the capacity reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect telephone calls specifically we currently lease capacity from regional providers on six of the 16 mated pairs of ss7 signal transfer points that comprise our network 

  

we have no control over the operation quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future our operations could be severely interrupted in addition rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies these mergers may cause the availability pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services that we use to increase significantly 

  

our signaling and ss7 services rely on links equipment and software provided to us from our vendors the most important of which are gateway equipment and software from tekelec and agilent technologies inc we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure product availability with these vendors we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products and services 

  

capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use 

  

if traffic from our telecommunication and content customers through our network increases we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software we may not be able to expand and 

  

  

upgrade in a timely manner our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network if we do not appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software we may lose customers and revenues 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a volunteer basis because of the importance to the functioning of the internet of these root zone servers our registry services business could be harmed if these volunteer operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our registry services business could be harmed if any of these volunteer operators fail to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and to the extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server system as provided in our registry agreement with icann it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the toplevel domain zone servers designated by us if icann does not do this our business could be harmed 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

services offered by our internet services group rely on public key cryptography technology that may compromise our system’s security 

  

services offered by our internet services group depend on public key cryptography technology with public key cryptography technology a user is given a public key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and that it is not lost stolen or otherwise compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as “factoring” this integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult should an easy factoring method be developed the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing pki services obsolete or unmarketable if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business in the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this negative public perception could harm our business 

  

  

some of our security services have lengthy sales and implementation cycles 

  

we market many of our security services directly to large companies and government agencies and we market our communications services to large telecommunication carriers the sale and implementation of our services to these entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources this process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers’ internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital expenditures deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations as a result the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain of our services can be lengthy potentially lasting from three to nine months our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized 

  

failure of verisign affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

we have licensed to verisign affiliates our processing center platform which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the affiliate to offer backend processing of pki services for enterprises the verisign processing center platform provides a verisign affiliate with the knowledge and technology to offer pki services similar to those offered by us it is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the verisign affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and customer service and support these practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control any failure of a verisign affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over ip networks generally 

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends on our internally developed technologies patents and other intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the united states in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies a thirdparty could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could delay the introduction of our internet infrastructure services until equivalent technology if available is identified licensed and integrated this could harm our business 

  

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and which could harm our business 

  

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future in addition we use content such as music 

  

  

games and logos as part of our content services and news content as part of our realtime publisher service it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties any claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel cause delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our security services and communications services than we would otherwise 

  

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

  

furthermore our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple distribution channels failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success also depends on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad in addition our stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel which consist of background checks into prospective employees’ criminal and financial histories further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions 

  

we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving verisign at any time in addition we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 

  

compliance with rules and regulations concerning corporate governance is costly and could harm our business 

  

the sarbanesoxley act mandates among other things that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements sets stricter independence and 

  

  

financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations for example section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their internal controls in addition the nasdaq stock market has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices and our compliance efforts have required significant management attention it has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we have been required to accept reduced coverage and incur substantially higher costs to obtain the reduced level of coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business 

  

regulations related to equity compensation will adversely affect our operating results and negatively impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

  

since our inception we have used stock options and other longterm equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages we believe that stock options and other longterm equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use of vesting encourage employees to remain with verisign the financial accounting standards board “fasb” recently issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “ sharebased payment ” which supersedes sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” that will require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants beginning in the first quarter of 2006 this change will have a material negative impact on our reported earnings pro forma compensation expense disclosed in the current and prior years may not be indicative of future compensation expense under sfas no 123r recording a charge for employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan under sfas no 123 would have increased after tax charges by approximately 1157 million 1368 million and 2159 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition regulations adopted by the nasdaq stock market require stockholder approval for stock option plans and could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future to the extent that new policies or regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees either of which could materially harm our business 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

  

verisign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan 

  

   

   

   

changes in or interpretations of tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are subject to audit by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation an adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result

in october 2005 the company and icann announced a proposed settlement of the various claims between them the settlement is conditioned upon among other things the execution of a new com registry agreement by both the company and icann and approval of the agreement by the united states department of commerce the proposed agreement has not yet been finally executed or approved if the settlement is finalized and implemented it will result in the dismissal of pending litigation with icann

verisign is involved in various other investigations claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business none of which in our opinion will harm its business verisign cannot assure that it will prevail in any litigation regardless of the outcome any litigation may require verisign to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention

overview 

  

verisign inc is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services that enable and protect billions of interactions everyday across the world’s voice and data networks in 2005 and 2004 our business consisted of two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group prior to 2004 our business included an additional reportable segment the network solutions domain name registrar business which was sold in november 2003 

  

improving economic conditions during 2005 in the us europe and japan led to improved it spending for security services and ecommerce activity in those markets we also saw continued growth in domain name registrations and domain name renewals with active domain names ending in  com and  net increasing by 30 during 2005 communication services group revenues increased significantly primarily due to increases in content services revenues during the year this increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of revenue coupled with significant growth in our content business for the year our content business grew in the second third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the comparable periods in 2004 however revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 due to increased competition pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers 

  

we derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of services sold primarily in the united states europe and japan in the internet services group more than 87 of the revenues during 2005 were derived from the sale of registry services managed authentication and security services and web certificates in the communications services group approximately 89 of the revenues were derived from the sale of content services signaling services ss7 connectivity billing services and calling name services during the same period 

  

for the communications services group we expect content services revenues to decline in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 and expect connectivity clearing and settlement and billingrelated revenues to be unchanged increased competition and continued consolidation in the telecommunications sector has increased pricing pressures and will continue to have the potential to adversely impact the communications services group’s results for the internet services group we expect continued growth in the levels of it spending for security services by our customers in the us europe and japan and continued growth in domain name registrations and renewals that we believe will result in revenue and deferred revenue growth for the first quarter of 2006 

  

  

payment gateway business sale 

  

on november 18 2005 we completed the sale of certain assets related to our payment gateway business to paypal inc and paypal international limited for 370 million in cash this transaction has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 144 “sfas 144” “accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets” and accordingly we have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all periods to reflect this transaction 

  

domain name registrar business sale 

  

on november 25 2003 we completed the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business to pivotal private equity although we retained a 15 interest in the business we will not recognize any revenue from the network solutions business in the future other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to network solutions as a customer

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts longlived assets restructuring stockbased compensation royalty liabilities and deferred income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred in order to determine current and deferred revenue we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 

  

revenues from our consulting services are recognized using either the proportional performance method or on a timeandmaterials basis as work is performed proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed revenues from timeandmaterials contracts are recognized as services are performed 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance each customer’s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above in addition we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future as of december 31 2005 the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 4 of total accounts receivable or approximately 116 million a change of 1 in our estimate would amount to approximately 28 million 

  

valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles 

  

our longlived assets consist primarily of goodwill other intangible assets and property and equipment we review at least annually goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” 

  

  

we review longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” such events or circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

  

recoverability of longlived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled approximately 13 billion at december 31 2005 which was comprised of 11 billion of goodwill and 02 billion of other intangible assets other intangible assets include customer relationships technology in place carrier relationships noncompete agreements trade names and other factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements it is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our longlived intangible assets including goodwill 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

in november 2003 we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units in april 2002 we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully rationalize integrate and align our resources both plans resulted in reductions in workforce abandonment of excess facilities disposal of property and equipment and other charges we expect these restructuring plans to be completed in 2014 upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space including the potential for sublease income estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates changing market conditions by location and considerable work with thirdparty leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis as necessary during 2005 we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately 05 million related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations such estimates will likely be revised in the future if sublease rates continue to change in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional 192 million over the next nine years relating to our restructuring plans 

  

accounting for stockbased incentive programs 

  

through december 31 2005 we measured compensation expense for our stockbased incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “ accounting for stock issued to employees ” under this method we did not record compensation expense when 

  

  

stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted we also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as long as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85 of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period in accordance with sfas 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation ” and sfas 148 “ accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure ” we disclosed our pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share as if the fair valuebased method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stockbased incentive programs 

  

to determine the pro forma impact of applying sfas 123 we estimated the fair value of our options using the black scholes option valuation model this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our common stock price the assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in the future we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sfas 123r” “ sharebased payment ” which requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in their consolidated statements of operations the accounting provisions of sfas 123r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt sfas 123r in the first quarter of 2006 and will recognize stockbased compensation expense using the modified prospective method the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas 123r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas 123r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share 

  

provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights 

  

certain of our content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others where we have not yet entered into a license agreement with the owner or license holder we record a provision for royalty payments that we estimate will be due once a license agreement is concluded we estimate the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized our estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property such as a change in demand for a particular type of content in which case we would record a royalty expense materially different than our estimate 

  

income taxes 

  

we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider past performance expected future taxable income and prudent feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and in international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income these changes if any may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded 

  

  

in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “sfas 5” “accounting for contingencies” 

  

results of operations 

  

revenues 

  

in 2005 and 2004 we had two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group in 2003 we had three reportable segments the internet services group the communications services group and network solutions as a result of our sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 we do not recognize revenues from this segment other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to network solutions as a customer a comparison of revenues from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is presented below 

  

   

internet services group 

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 revenues from our internet services group increased approximately by 1178 million in 2005 in comparison to 2004 primarily due to the increase in information services and security services revenues of approximately 621 million and 557 million respectively the information services revenue increase was attributed to an increase in the number of active domains ending in com and net under management the increase in security services revenues was primarily due to an increase in website digital certificate revenues of 292 million and an increase in managed security services and security consulting revenues of 172 million 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 internet services group revenues increased approximately 1172 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in information services and security services revenues of approximately 657 million and 515 million respectively information services revenues increased as a result of recognizing revenues from network solutions that were previously eliminated prior to the sale of the domain name registrar business and as a result of an increase in the number of active domain names ending in com and net under management the security services revenue increase was due to increases in managed security services and consulting services revenues of 185 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of guardent in february 2004 and increases in web site digital certificate revenue of 223 million 

  

the following table compares active domain names ending in com and net managed by our information services business and the approximate installed base of web site digital certificates in our commerce site services business as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

  

we expect internet services group revenues will grow in the first quarter of 2006 as demand for domain names as well as the number of installed digital certificates is expected to continue to increase 

  

communications services group 

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 revenues from our communications services group increased approximately 3734 million primarily due to a 3771 million increase in content services revenues during the year this increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of revenue in 2005 as compared to the last seven months of 2004 coupled with significant growth in our content business for the year the content business grew in the second third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the comparable periods in 2004 however revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 due to increased competition pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers network services and connectivity revenues increased approximately 70 million and clearing roaming settlement and intelligent network services revenues also increased by approximately 109 million primarily due an increase in the number of records and transactions cleared these increases were offset by a decline in billing and payment services of approximately 247 million primarily due to a decline in the customer base and pricing reductions for these services during the year intelligent database services revenues were unchanged from 2004 as increases in queries were offset by price declines in our calling name cnam service 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 communications services group revenues increased approximately 1956 million primarily due to an increase in content revenues of 1808 million attributable to our acquisition of jamba in june 2004 in addition intelligent database services revenues increased approximately 150 million primarily due to increases in calling name cnam and local and wireless number portability revenues 

  

the following table compares the approximate number of annual database queries as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

we expect communications services group revenues to decrease in the first quarter of 2006 principally as a result of continued declines in the number of subscribers in our content business 

  

network solutions 

  

we completed the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 and recognized no revenues from this segment in 2005 or 2004 we will not recognize any revenue from the network solutions business in the future other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to network solutions as a customer 

  

  

revenues by geographic region 

  

our revenues are broken out into three geographic regions consisting of the americas emea and apac the following table shows a comparison of our continuing revenues by geographic region for each year presented 

  

      

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 revenues increased approximately 2218 million in the americas region primarily as a result of the increase in domain names ending in com and net under management coupled with an increase in the installed base of website digital certificates revenues in our emea region increased approximately 2359 million primarily due to recognizing a full year of revenue from our content business in the region coupled with strong growth in our content business in the first half of 2005 the increase in apac revenues of approximately 335 million was attributed to increased enterprise security revenues in both japan and australia and increased managed security services revenue in japan 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 revenues decreased 1017 million in the americas region primarily as a result of the sale of network solutions in november 2003 revenues in our emea region increased 1891 million in the same period primarily due to the acquisition of jamba in june 2004 which contributed revenues of approximately 1808 million in 2004 in addition increases in our web certificate and managed pki sales in emea also contributed to the increase partially offset by decreases in our verisign affiliate revenues as we continued to move to a direct distribution model through international subsidiaries in certain larger european markets the increase in apac revenues of 136 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily related to increased enterprise security revenues in both japan and australia partially offset by a decrease in verisign affiliate revenues 

  

we expect international revenues will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to an anticipated decline in content revenues in the emea region 

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of revenues consists primarily of content licensing costs carrier costs for our ss7 and ipbased networks costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services billing services operational costs for the domain name registration business customer support and training consulting and development services operational costs related to the management and monitoring of our clients’ network security infrastructures and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities 

  

we anticipate that our overall cost of revenues will increase in 2006 but that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will stay flat or decrease modestly in 2006 primarily due to greater cost efficiencies from our current businesses and recently acquired businesses 

  

  

a comparison of cost of revenues and employee headcount for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is presented below 

  

   

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 cost of revenues increased approximately 762 million primarily due to an increase of approximately 356 million in salary and employee benefit costs from increased headcount related to content services and acquisitions contract and professional services increased approximately 255 million in 2005 due to increased thirdparty customer care services consulting costs for billing services and service development costs for prepaid services retailer commissions related to content services increased approximately 74 million over 2004 other increases in cost of revenues were related to cost of maintenance of equipment and software 

  

as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily from leveraging our existing capital equipment and service delivery platforms overall depreciation expense on our new and existing equipment was unchanged in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 cost of revenues decreased approximately 31 million primarily due a decrease of 695 million as a result of the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business which was offset by increases attributable to the acquisitions of jamba and guardent of 498 million and 153 million respectively 

  

as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business which was a business with higher costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue than our other business segments 

  

sales and marketing 

  

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales marketing and policy activities these expenses include salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees and costs of marketing programs such as internet television radio print and direct mail advertising costs 

  

we expect overall sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues to decrease as we expect to optimize our advertising expenses in certain countries for our content services efforts in marketing new products such as unified authentication and related services will continue in the first quarter of 2006 

  

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses and employee headcount for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is presented below 

  

   

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 sales and marketing expenses increased approximately 2388 million primarily due to an increase of approximately 2041 million relating to advertising marketing and promotional expenses for our content and application services business salary and employee benefits increased approximately 300 million due to an increase in overall sales and marketing headcount increase in corporate brand advertising including the relaunch of our brand and corporate marketing amounted for approximately 44 million 

  

as a percentage of revenues sales and marketing expenses increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing spending in our content and application services business in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 sales and marketing expenses increased approximately 544 million primarily due to our acquisitions of jamba and guardent which had sales and marketing expenses of 805 million and 88 million respectively that were partially offset by a decrease of 383 million in sales and marketing expenses due to the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business additionally we experienced an increase of approximately 71 million in advertising and marketing costs during this period primarily as a result of increased corporate brand advertising 

  

as a percentage of revenues sales and marketing expenses increased in 2004 due to the increase in advertising and marketing spending as described above 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees and the costs of facilities computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development 

  

we believe that rapid development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our leadership position in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development as a result we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and increase modestly as a percentage of revenues in 2006 

  

a comparison of research and development expenses and employee headcount for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is presented below 

  

   

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 research and development expenses increased approximately 349 million primarily due to an increase in headcount from our acquisitions resulting in an increase of approximately 265 million in salary and employee related benefit costs other increases included approximately 33 million in occupancy related costs related to acquisitions and approximately 20 million of costs related to outside services 

  

as a percentage of revenues research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2005 compared to 2004 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 research and development expenses increased 110 million primarily due to our acquisitions of guardent and jamba research and development spending attributable to these acquired entities was 34 million and 35 million respectively the sale of our network solutions 

  

  

business had no material effect on our research and development expense additionally we experienced an increase of approximately 41 million in increased costs associated with contract and professional services to support new and existing research and development efforts 

  

as a percentage of revenues research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense 

  

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in 2006 will increase marginally in absolute dollars and as a percentage of overall revenues 

  

a comparison of general and administrative expenses and employee headcount for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is presented below 

  

   

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 general and administrative expenses increased approximately 306 million primarily due to an increase of approximately 184 million in salary and employee benefit costs as a result of increased headcount equipment and software related expenses increased approximately 74 million primarily due to an increase in hardware maintenance costs software licenses and depreciation expense legal costs increased approximately 31 million primarily due to litigation settlements during the year contract and professional services increased approximately 31 million primarily due to services related to audit tax and sarbanesoxley compliance these increases were partially offset by decreases in other corporate expenses 

  

as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to increased revenues from our content services business which has lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than other businesses coupled with our ability to leverage existing general and administrative costs 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 91 million primarily due to a decrease of 98 million attributable to the sale of our network solutions business partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses from our acquisitions 

  

excluding the effects of the acquisitions of guardent and jamba and the sale of our network solutions business the overall decrease in general and administrative costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 was 133 million this was primarily due to a reduction in costs from prior restructuring efforts of approximately 208 million along with other efficiencies from cost reduction efforts of 56 million and a decrease in our bad debt expense of approximately 54 million these decreases were partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately 110 million as a result of costs associated with litigation and increases in contract and professional services of approximately 75 million primarily due to expenses related to sarbanesoxley compliance 

  

as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2004 as described above 

  

  

the following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense and our days sales outstanding “dso” for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

dso increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of our acquisition of jamba in june 2004 we expect that dso will be in the range of 40 to 50 days throughout 2006 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

below is a comparison of the restructuring and other charges for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

the changes in restructuring and other charges are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives 

  

2003 restructuring plan  in 2003 we announced a restructuring initiative related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units and recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately 542 million during 2004 we recorded restructuring charges of 27 million related to noncancelable lease costs for excess facilities 11 million related to workforce reduction charges 10 million for exit costs and 02 million for other charges relating to property and equipment writeoffs during 2005 we recorded reversals to excess facilities of approximately 19 million relating to certain operating leases 

  

2002 restructuring plan  in 2002 we announced plans to restructure our operations to rationalize integrate and align resources in 2003 we recorded other charges of 92 million related to the writeoff of certain computer software we also recorded restructuring charges of 87 million related to noncancelable lease costs for excess facilities 15 million related to workforce reduction charges and 10 million of exit costs in 2005 we recorded charges of approximately 14 million relating to excess facilities that were either abandoned or downsized due to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs 

  

other charges during 2004 we recorded other charges of approximately 201 million relating to certain asset writeoffs during 2005 we abandoned the development efforts related to an internally developed software project and recorded an expense of approximately 216 million to other charges 

  

amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

below is a comparison of our amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

  

sfas no 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis sfas no 144 requires that longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset 

  

there was no impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment tests conducted in june 2005 and 2004 

  

the annual impairment test conducted in june 2003 resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets of 1232 million during the second quarter of 2003 we recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of 302 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of entering into an agreement to sell our network solutions business the event triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to network solutions after considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture we determined that the carrying value exceeded the implied fair value of network solutions’ goodwill total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as allocated to our operating segments for the year ended december 31 2003 are as follows 

  

   

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately 222 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of jamba in june of 2004 and amortization expense related to our acquisition of lightsurf in april of 2005 amortization of intangible assets acquired from jamba accounted for approximately 102 million of the increase amortization of intangible assets acquired from lightsurf accounted for approximately 88 million of the increase 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 amortization of other intangible assets decreased approximately 1023 million as other intangible assets related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized 

  

see notes 1 and 7 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

acquired inprocess research and development 

  

during 2005 we wrote off 77 million of inprocess research and development acquired in the purchase of lightsurf idefense moreover and rsi at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses accordingly these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

  

minority interest 

  

minority interest represents the portion of net income belonging to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries 

  

  

a comparison of minority interest for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is presented below 

  

   

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 minority interest increased primarily from increased net income from our verisign japan subsidiary primarily due to an increase in the installed base of website security certificates and increased demand for managed security services in japan 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 minority interest increased in primarily from increased net income from our verisign japan subsidiary in june 2004 we acquired the remaining 49 minority interest in verisign australia which is now a whollyowned subsidiary 

  

other income expense net 

  

other income net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses 

  

the following table presents the components of other income net for years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 other income decreased approximately 332 million primarily due to the gain on sale of verisign japan of approximately 749 million recorded in 2004 partially offset by an increase in realized gains on investments net of losses and impairments in 2005 of approximately 195 million interest income increased 117 million primarily as a result of higher cash balances and slightly higher interest rates during 2005 in addition we recorded a gain of approximately 60 million related to the resolution of a dispute with a telecommunications carrier customer during 2005 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 other income increased approximately 925 million primarily due to the gain on sale of verisign japan interest income increased approximately 104 million primarily due to higher cash balances 

  

income tax expense 

  

in the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of 1047 million or 430 of pretax income 204 million or 105 of pretax income and 182 million or 73 of pretax loss respectively our effective tax rates differ from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to state taxes acquisitionrelated expenses the realization of domestic net operating loss capital loss and research credit carryforwards and the impact of foreign operations 

  

  

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors including our past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to us federal and state operations are realizable however depending on our continued ability to achieve profitability and on the potential impact of sfas 123r we may have sufficient evidence in 2006 to conclude that realization of additional deferred tax assets is more likely than not and thus realize a tax benefit in that period from a reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

  

if the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets were released as of december 31 2005 approximately 2377 million would be credited to the statement of operations and 1012 million would be credited to additional paidin capital management would continue to apply a valuation allowance of 558 million to the deferred tax asset relating to the writedown of investments due to the limited carryover life and character of such tax attributes management does not believe it is more likely than not that 83 million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable therefore a valuation allowance is applied to the deferred tax asset on the remaining foreign operations management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized accordingly a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 2314 million state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 2425 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 311 million if we are not able to use them the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2023 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2006 through 2023 most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary we had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately 70 million available for carryover to future years and for state income tax purposes of approximately 38 million available for carryover to future years the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire if not utilized in 2010 through 2025 state research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized 

  

the tax reform act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code we experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50 percent in 2003 and 2002 these changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize us federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards of 2329 million and 1165 million respectively losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward but are subject to the expiration dates described in the prior paragraph 

  

in the consolidated balance sheets we have not included deferred tax assets of 1511 million for a capital loss carryforward and 670 million for a net operating loss generated by stock options the capital loss and the net operating loss generated by the stock options are each subject to a ruling request currently on file with the irs and will be allowed if and when we receive a favorable ruling if the irs issues favorable rulings to us the deferred tax assets could be recognized and if recognized the 1511 million will be credited to income tax expense and the 670 million will be credited to additional paidin capital the outcome of these ruling requests is uncertain as the rulings are solely dependent on the irs’ discretion

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant noncancelable contractual obligations at december 31 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

  

   

as of december 31 2005 we had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014 see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

future operating lease payments include payments related to leases on excess facilities included in our restructuring plans the restructuring liability is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms the longest of which extends through 2014 if sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional 192 million over the next nine years relating to our restructuring plans cash payments totaling approximately 396 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next nine years see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans not including other cost savings efforts were estimated to have been approximately 25 to 30 million in 2005 and are estimated to be approximately the same in 2006 

  

in november 1999 we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the tuvalu internet toplevel domain “tv” with the government of tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to 62 million through 2008 

  

we have pledged a portion of our shortterm investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements we have pledged approximately 60 million pursuant to such agreements classified as restricted cash and investments on the accompanying balance sheet as of december 31 2005 in addition we established a trust during the first quarter of 2004 in the amount of 450 million classified as restricted cash and investments on our balance sheet for our director and officer liability selfinsurance coverage 

  

to facilitate our stock repurchase program designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties 

  

on november 21 2005 we entered into a 250 million asr agreement with a large investment bank under the asr agreement we purchased approximately 108 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of approximately 2314 

  

on august 2 2005 our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to use up to 500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades during 2005 16495224 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of 3803 million at december 31 2005 approximately 1197 million remained available for future repurchases under this program

if we liquidated certain availableforsale investments as of december 31 2005 we would have recognized losses of approximately 54 million in our statement of operations instead these unrecognized losses partially offset by unrecognized gains are recorded as a separate component of equity and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

we believe existing cash and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses acquisitions and share repurchases we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “ sharebased payment ” which requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statement of operations the accounting provisions of sfas 123r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt sfas 123r in the first quarter of 2006 and will recognize stockbased compensation expense using the modified prospective method the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition see “ stock compensation plans and unearned compensation ” in note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts for 2003 through 2005 as if we had used a fairvaluebased method similar to the methods required under sfas 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas 123r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas 123r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position no 1091 “fsp 1091” “ application of fasb statement no 109  “ accounting for income taxes” to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 ” the ajca introduces a special 9 tax deduction on qualified production activities fas 1091 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with sfas 109 pursuant to the ajca we will not be able to claim this tax benefit until the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position no 1092 “fsp 1092” “ accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of 2004 ” the ajca introduces a limited time 85 dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision provided certain criteria are met fsp 1092 provides accounting and 

  

  

disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision we do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 154 “sfas 154” “ accounting changes and error corrections” which replaces apb opinion no 20 “ accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “ reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements—an amendment of apb opinion no 28”  sfas 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the impact that the adoption of sfas 154 will have on our results of operations and financial position will depend on the nature of future accounting changes adopted by verisign and the nature of transitional guidance provided in future accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

equity investments 

  

we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes in most instances we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market and therefore carry a high level of risk these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the nearterm therefore these companies may never become publicly traded even if they do an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments in 2005 2004 and 2003 we determined the decline in value of certain public and nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and we recognized impairments totaling 08 million 126 million and 170 million respectively due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

the primary objective of our cash management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving aftertax returns some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to interest rate risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value to minimize interest rate risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper mediumterm notes corporate bonds and notes us government and agency securities and money market funds in general money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate as of december 31 2005 45 of our investments subject to interest rate risk mature in less than one year if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at december 31 2005 this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 

  

  

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2005 this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk 

  

   

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks in the fourth quarter of 2003 we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months 

  

at december 31 2005 we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately 1732 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with highquality financial institutions

that timely development of new and enhanced internet security ecommerce naming and directory and communications services and technologies are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue recruiting and hiring experienced research and development personnel and to make additional investments in research and development 

  

our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we have developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally or acquired through business acquisitions 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

competition in security services  our security services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for internet security services including network security authentication validation and secure payment services which enable secure electronic commerce and communications over wireline and wireless ip networks the market for security services is intensely competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 

  

principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as rsa security and entrust technologies which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as geo trust and digital signature trust company a subsidiary of identrus that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authority or ca related services and 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as betrusted we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore netscape and microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products 

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future 

  

we face competition in our payment services business from companies such as cybersource authorizenet a division of lightbridge and first data corporation among others 

  

competition in managed security services  consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services these companies include large systems integrators and consulting firms such as accenture formerly andersen consulting ibm global services and lucent netcare we also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services such as symantec and iss as well as a number of providers such as ubizen and redsiren that offer managed security services exclusively telecommunications providers such as mci which recently acquired netsec a provider of managed security services are also potential competitors in addition we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of ip addresses and name maps throughout enterprisewide intranets and with companies with internally developed systems integration efforts 

  

competition in communications services the market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure competition in this area arises from two primary sources incumbent carriers provide competing services in their regions in addition we face direct competition on a nationwide basis from unregulated companies including syniverse technologies and other carriers such as southern new england telephone diversified group a unit of sbc communications our wireless billing and payment services also are subject to competition from providers such as boston communications group amdocs and convergys corporation we are also aware of major internet service providers software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are or may in the future be focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that may compete directly with ours furthermore customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as verisign and further increase competitive pricing pressures 

  

competition in mobile content services the market for mobile content services is extremely competitive competitors include developers of content and entertainment products and services in a variety of domestic and international markets such as infospace itouch wisdom entertainment arvato mobile monstermob and buongiornovitaminic this business also faces competition from mobile network operators such as cingular verizon wireless sprint tmobile vodafone o 2  orange eplus and telefónica as well as internet portal operators such as yahoo aol tonline and google additional competitors are handset manufacturers such as nokia and software providers such as microsoft as the market for wireless entertainment and information products matures mobile phone companies broadcasters music publishers other content providers or others may begin to develop competing products or services 

  

competition in registry services there are several registry service providers for new gtlds that directly compete with the services we provide for the com and net gtlds as well as with the cctlds offered by us the gtlds biz and info were launched in 2001 and the gtlds name pro aero museum and coop were launched in 2002 and 2003 domain names registrations and other services within these gtlds are available through icann accredited registrars in addition we currently face competition from the over 240 cctld registry operators who compete directly for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolutions and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are ultradns neulevel affilias registercom and tucowscom 

  

competition in digital brand management services we face competition from companies providing services similar to some of our digital brand management services in the monitoring services registration and domain name asset management area of our business our competition comes primarily from icann accredited registrars and various smaller companies providing similar services 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressure 

  

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not 

  

adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

industry regulation 

  

naming and directory services within the us government leadership for the continued privatization of internet administration is currently provided by the department of commerce 

  

on november 10 1999 we entered into a series of wideranging agreements these agreements included the following 

  

   

   

   

   

our registry agreement with icann was replaced by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com  one for net and one for org  the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007 with a 4year renewal option the term of the net registry agreement extends until june 30 2005 currently the net registry services are in a competitive bidding process by icann we submitted a bid along with four other bidders the selection of the next net registry operator is scheduled to be made in late march 2005 the org registry agreement terminated on december 31 2002 and the org registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by icann during 2003 

  

the descriptions of these agreements are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are filed as exhibits to the periodic reports indicated in the index to the exhibits contained in part iv of this annual report on form 10k 

  

security services some of our security services utilize and incorporate encryption technology exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the united states and various nonunited states governments we have obtained approval to export many of the security services we provide to customers globally under applicable united states export law including our server digital certificate services as the list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or changed government restrictions on the export of software products utilizing encryption technology may grow and become an impediment to our growth in international markets if we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell some of our security services in international markets 

  

there are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certification authorities but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to certification authorities if we do not comply with these state laws and regulations we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us moreover if our market for digital certificates grows the united states federal state or foreign governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certification authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services these regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

communications services one service provided by the communications services group is currently subject to federal communications commission “fcc” regulation this service allows wireless users who are “roaming” in areas where their home carrier has not made arrangements for automatic roaming service to complete calls to domestic and international destinations the communications services group has been authorized by the fcc to provide this service further our communications customers are subject to fcc regulation which indirectly affects our communications services business we cannot predict when or upon what terms and conditions further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or deregulation on our business several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services which may increase our costs of operations in addition future services we may provide could be subject to direct government regulation 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information

with regard to our secure payments business we rely on proprietary software and technology covering many aspects of ecommerce transactions such as electronic funds transfers and multicurrency transactions in addition we have strategic relationships with third parties involved in ecommerce transactions such as issuing banks and financial processors and those agreements provide us with intellectual property rights with respect to performing those services 

  

with regard to our naming and directory services business our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our registry service business and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses including the conversion of internationalized domain names we own our proprietary shared registration system through which competing registrars submit com and net secondlevel domain name registrations some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors

employees 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function 

  

   

we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be good our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 

  

segment information 

  

during 2004 we operated our business in two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group during 2003 we operated our business in three reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group both of which are described above and the network solutions business segment through which we provided domain name registration and value added services such as business email websites hosting and other web presence services effective november 25 2003 when we completed the sale of our network solutions business to pivotal private equity we realigned our operations into two servicebased business segments consisting of the internet services group and the communications services group prior to 2003 we operated our business in two reportable segments the enterprise and service provider division and the mass markets division segment information based on our current organizational structures is set forth in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements referred to in item 8 below 

  

factors that may affect future results of operations 

  

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions 

  

adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to downturns in the telecommunications and technology industries in the past and could impact our business in the future resulting in 

  

   

   

   

recent political turmoil in many parts of the world including terrorist and military actions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not continue to improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

  

our limited operating history under our current business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results 

  

we completed several acquisitions between 2000 and 2003 including our acquisitions of network solutions illuminet holdings and ho systems in february 2004 and june 2004 respectively we completed our acquisitions of guardent inc and jamba in november 2003 we sold our network solutions domain name registrar business network solutions illuminet holdings ho systems and jamba operated in different businesses from our thencurrent business therefore we have only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects our success will depend on many factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

to address these risks we must among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we have faced difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with acquisitions 

  

we made several acquisitions in the last five years and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future we have experienced difficulty in and in the future may face difficulties integrating the personnel products 

  

technologies or operations of companies we acquire assimilating acquired businesses involves a number of other risks including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future acquisitions our business could be harmed 

  

additionally there is risk that we may incur additional expenses associated with an impairment of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions for acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and to evaluate other intangible assets as events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired these evaluations could result in further impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

  

the expansion of our international operations subjects our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

international revenues accounted for approximately 28 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 as a result of our acquisition of jamba we expect that international revenues will increase in absolute monetary terms and as a percentage of revenues we intend to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities for example we expect to expand our operations and marketing activities throughout asia europe india latin america and south america with our jamba acquisition we have facilities and nearly 500 employees in germany expansion into these international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor some of our other services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets failure to do so could 

  

harm our business in addition there are risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our failure to manage past and future growth in our business could harm our business 

  

between december 31 1995 and december 31 2004 we grew from 26 to approximately 3200 employees this was achieved through internal growth as well as acquisitions during this time period we opened new sales offices and significantly expanded our us and nonus operations to successfully manage past growth and any future growth we will need to continue to implement additional management information systems continue the development of our operating administrative financial and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our executive engineering accounting finance marketing sales and operations organizations any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business 

  

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

  

competition in security services  our security services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for internet security services including network security authentication validation and secure payment services which enable secure electronic commerce and communications over wireline and wireless ip networks the market for security services is intensely competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 

  

principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as rsa security inc “rsa” and entrust technologies which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as geo trust and digital signature trust company a subsidiary of identrus that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authority or ca related services and 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as betrusted we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore netscape and microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products 

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future 

  

we face competition in our payment services business from companies such as cybersource authorizenet a division of lightbridge and first data corporation among others 

  

competition in managed security services  consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services these companies include large systems integrators and consulting firms such as accenture formerly andersen consulting ibm global services and lucent netcare we also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services such as symantec and iss as well as a number of providers such as ubizen and redsiren that offer managed security services exclusively telecommunications providers such as mci which recently acquired netsec a provider of managed security services are also potential competitors in addition we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of ip addresses and name maps throughout enterprisewide intranets and with companies with internally developed systems integration efforts 

  

competition in communications services the market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure competition in this area arises from two primary sources incumbent carriers provide competing services in their regions in addition we face direct competition on a nationwide basis from unregulated companies including syniverse technologies and other carriers such as southern new england telephone diversified group a unit of sbc communications our wireless billing and payment services also are subject to competition from providers such as boston communications group amdocs and convergys corporation we are also aware of major internet service providers software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are or may in the future be focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that may compete directly with ours furthermore customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as verisign and further increase competitive pricing pressures 

  

competition in mobile content services the market for mobile content services is extremely competitive competitors include developers of content and entertainment products and services in a variety of domestic and international markets such as infospace itouch wisdom entertainment arvato mobile monstermob and buongiornovitaminic this business also faces competition from mobile network operators such as cingular verizon wireless sprint tmobile vodafone o 2  orange eplus and telefónica as well as internet portal operators such as yahoo aol tonline and google additional competitors are handset manufacturers such as nokia and software providers such as microsoft as the market for wireless entertainment and information products matures mobile phone companies broadcasters music publishers other content providers or others may begin to develop competing products or services 

  

competition in registry services icann has introduced several registry service providers for new gtlds that directly compete with the services we provide for the com and net gtlds as well as with the 

  

cctlds offered by us the gtlds biz and info were launched in 2001 and the gtlds name pro aero museum and coop were launched in 2002 and 2003 domain names registrations and other services within these gtlds are available through icann accredited registrars in addition we currently face competition from the over 240 cctld registry operators who compete directly for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence 

  

we also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration resolutions and other dns services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are ultradns neulevel affilias registercom and tucowscom 

  

competition in digital brand management services we face competition from companies providing services similar to some of our digital brand management services in the monitoring services registration and domain name asset management area of our business our competition comes primarily from icann accredited registrars and various smaller companies providing similar services 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressure 

  

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

our communications services business depends on the acceptance of our ss7 network and the telecommunications market’s continuing use of ss7 technology 

  

our future growth in our communications services business depends in part on the commercial success and reliability of our ss7 network our ss7 network is a vital component of our intelligent network services which had been a significant source of revenues for our communications services group our communications services business will suffer if our target customers do not use our ss7 network our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced ss7based services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our particular ss7 network solution or continue to use our ss7 network in the future we may not be successful in marketing our ss7 network or any new or enhanced services 

  

the inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our business 

  

significant technical challenges exist in our signaling and network services business because many of our customers 

  

   

   

   

customer implementation currently requires participation by our order management and our engineering and operations groups each of which has limited resources some customers may also require us to develop costly customized features or capabilities which increase our costs and consume a disproportionate share of our limited customer service and support resources also we typically charge onetime flat rate fees for initially connecting a customer to our ss7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the connection is established if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our engineering service support we may experience reduced operating margins our customers’ ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and integrate them successfully within their systems depends on our customers’ capabilities and the complexity involved difficulty in deploying those services could reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause potential delays in recognizing revenues until the services are implemented 

  

our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our communications services at desired pricing levels and industry consolidation could adversely impact our revenues and cash flow 

  

the telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price competition competition and industry consolidation in our communications services could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion in our market share pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in the selling price of our services for example our competitors may provide customers with reduced communications costs for internet access or private network services reducing the overall cost of services and significantly increasing pricing pressures on us we would need to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of our customers generating higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs and we may not be able to do so successfully we believe that the business of providing network connectivity and related network services will see increased consolidation in the future consolidation could decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries which could erode our market share revenues and operating margins in our communications services group consolidation in the telecommunications industry has led to the merging of many companies including price communications a customer of our communications services group and there have been recent announcements of proposed mergers involving other of our customers including att wireless mci and nextel our business could be harmed if these mergers result in the loss of customers by our communications services group furthermore customers may choose to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services thereby reducing the demand for technologies and services we offer which could harm our business 

  

our mobile content services business depends on agreements with many different third parties including wireless carriers and content providers if these agreements are terminated or not renewed this business could be harmed 

  

our mobile content services business depends on our ability to enter into and maintain agreements with many different third parties including 

  

   

   

these agreements are typically for a short term or are otherwise terminable upon short notice and in the case of agreements with carriers other mobile phone service providers and content developers are nonexclusive if these third parties reduce their commitment to us terminate their agreements with us or enter into 

  

similar agreements with our competitors the results of operations of our communications services group could be materially harmed for example because we depend on wireless carriers to bill customers for our services a loss of any of these relationships could prevent us from billing and receiving revenues from customers this business could also be harmed if we are unable to enter into additional agreements with third parties on commercially reasonable terms 

  

our mobile content services business is dependent on third parties offering attractive content and technology on acceptable terms 

  

only some of our mobile content services are developed internally we also receive content such as ring tones games and logos from third parties if the market for mobile entertainment and information continues to develop positively content providers might try to raise their prices some providers insist on charging fixed fees for their content regardless of revenues so if we fail to achieve anticipated revenues we would achieve lower margins for our mobile content services there is no assurance that we will be able to timely purchase content having the requisite quality in the future and on commercially reasonable terms should we be unable to acquire attractive content from third parties and on acceptable terms this could adversely affect our mobile content services business 

  

our customer subscription agreements for our mobile content services are typically cancelable and our business could be harmed if significant numbers of customers cancel or fail to renew 

  

our mobile content services are typically sold as fixed monthly subscriptions our customers for these services may cancel their subscriptions for our service at the end of each monthly service period and in fact many customers each month elect to do so we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their dissatisfaction with the service pricing pressure changes in preferences and trends competitive services or other reasons if our customers cancel or fail to renew their subscriptions for this service our revenue could decline and our mobile content services business will suffer 

  

our business depends on the continued growth of the internet and adoption and continued use of ip networks 

  

our future success depends in part on continued growth in the use of the internet and ip networks if the use of and interest in the internet and ip networks does not grow our business would be harmed to date many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the internet and ip networks for a number of reasons including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the widespread acceptance of the internet and ip networks will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging information organizations that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods also individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting payments may be reluctant to change 

  

a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering various initiatives that could permit sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives are adopted it could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and therefore hinder the growth in the use of the internet and ip networks which could harm our business 

  

many of our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could suffer 

  

we target our security services at the market for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks as a result of our acquisition of jamba our communications services group is also targeting the consumer market for mobile content services our naming and directory services business unit is developing managed services designed to work with the epcglobal network and radio frequency identification or rfid technology these are rapidly evolving markets that may not continue to grow even if these markets grow our services may not be widely accepted accordingly the demand for our services is very uncertain the factors that may affect the level of market acceptance and consequently our services include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if the market for electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or these services are not widely accepted in the market our business would be materially harmed 

  

our inability to react to changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

  

the emerging nature of the internet mobile content digital certificate domain name registration and payment services markets and their rapid evolution require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings in particular the market for entertainment and information is characterized by changing technology developing industry standards changing customer preferences and trends which also vary from country to country and the constant introduction of new products and services in order to remain competitive we must continually improve our access technology and software support the latest transmission technologies and adapt our products and services to changing market conditions and customer preferences when entertainment products are placed on the market it is difficult to predict whether they will become popular 

  

the communications network services industry is also characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements significant technological changes could make our technologies obsolete and other changes in our markets particularly mobile content could result in some of our other products and services losing market share accordingly we must continually improve the responsiveness reliability and features of our services and develop new features services and applications to meet changing 

  

customer needs in our target markets for example we sell our ss7 network services primarily to traditional telecommunications companies that rely on traditional voice networks many emerging companies are providing convergent internet protocolbased network services our future success could also depend upon our ability to provide products and services to these internet protocolbased telephony providers particularly if ipbased telephony becomes widely accepted we cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a costeffective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share 

  

new products and services developed or introduced by us may not result in any significant revenues 

  

we must commit significant resources to develop new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept the success of new products and services depends on several factors including proper new definition and timely completion introduction and market acceptance for example our selection in january 2004 by epcglobal a notforprofit standards organization to operate the object naming service as the root directory for the epcglobal network may not increase our revenues in the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunities develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products services and technologies developed by others will not render our products services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our inability to successfully market new products and services may harm our business 

  

issues arising from our agreements with icann and the department of commerce could harm our registry business 

  

the department of commerce or doc has adopted a plan for a phased transition of the doc’s responsibilities for the domain name system to the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers or icann as part of this transition our registry agreement with icann was replaced by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com  one for net and one for org  the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007 with a 4year renewal option the term of the net registry agreement extends until june 30 2005 currently the net registry services are in a competitive bidding process by icann we submitted a bid along with four other bidders the selection of the next net registry operator is scheduled to be made in march 2005 the org registry agreement terminated on december 31 2002 and the org registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by icann during 2003 we face risks from this transition to icann which include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

on august 27 2004 we filed a lawsuit against icann in the superior court of the state of california county of los angeles the lawsuit alleges that icann overstepped its contractual authority and improperly attempted to regulate our business in violation of icann’s charter and its agreements with us we cannot predict the affect this lawsuit will have on our relationship with icann 

  

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our domain name registry business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including other domestic and foreign governmental authorities to our role in the ongoing privatization of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of these challenges it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our domain name registry business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted 

  

if we encounter system interruptions we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in mountain view california and kawasaki japan both of which are susceptible to earthquakes providence rhode island dulles virginia lacey washington overland park kansas melbourne australia and berlin hamburg and verl germany any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business 

  

in addition our ability to issue digital certificates our domain name registry services and other of our services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past 

  

a failure in the operation of our domain name zone servers the domain name root servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction which could harm our business 

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system the root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure 

  

despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our services such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

the reliance of our network connectivity and interoperability services and mobile content services on thirdparty communications infrastructure hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control 

  

the success of our network connectivity and interoperability services and mobile content services depends on our network infrastructure including the capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers in particular we rely on att mci sprint and other telecommunications providers for leased longhaul and local loop transmission capacity these companies provide the dedicated links that connect our network components to each other and to our customers our business also depends upon the capacity reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect telephone calls specifically we currently lease capacity from regional providers on six of the 16 mated pairs of ss7 signal transfer points that comprise our network 

  

we have no control over the operation quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future our operations could be severely interrupted in addition rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies these mergers may cause the availability pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services that we use to increase significantly 

  

our signaling and ss7 services rely on links equipment and software provided to us from our vendors the most important of which are gateway equipment and software from tekelec and agilent technologies inc we 

  

cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure product availability with these vendors we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products and services 

  

capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use 

  

if traffic from our telecommunication and mobile content customers through our network increases we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software we may not be able to expand and upgrade in a timely manner our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network if we do not appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software we may lose customers and revenues 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a volunteer basis because of the importance to the functioning of the internet of these root zone servers our registry services business could be harmed if these volunteer operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our registry services business could be harmed if any of these volunteer operators fail to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and to the extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server system as provided in our registry agreement with icann it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the toplevel domain zone servers designated by us if icann does not do this our business could be harmed 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

services offered by our internet services group rely on public key cryptography technology that may compromise our system’s security 

  

services offered by our internet services group depend on public key cryptography technology with public key cryptography technology a user is given a public key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and that it is not lost stolen or otherwise compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as “factoring” this integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult 

  

should an easy factoring method be developed the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing pki services obsolete or unmarketable if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business in the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this negative public perception could harm our business 

  

some of our security services have lengthy sales and implementation cycles 

  

we market many of our security services directly to large companies and government agencies and we market our communications services to large telecommunication carriers the sale and implementation of our services to these entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources this process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers’ internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital expenditures deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations as a result the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain of our services can be lengthy potentially lasting from three to nine months our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized 

  

failure of verisign affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

we have licensed to verisign affiliates our processing center platform which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the affiliate to offer backend processing of pki services for enterprises the verisign processing center platform provides a verisign affiliate with the knowledge and technology to offer pki services similar to those offered by us it is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the verisign affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and customer service and support these practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control any failure of a verisign affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over ip networks generally 

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends on our internally developed technologies patents and other intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the united states in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 

  

or at all our business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies a thirdparty could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could delay the introduction of our internet infrastructure services until equivalent technology if available is identified licensed and integrated this could harm our business 

  

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and which could harm our business 

  

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future in addition we use content such as music games and logos as part of our mobile content services it is possible that we could become subject to additional claims for infringement of the intellectual property of third parties any claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel cause delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for example we had complaints filed against us in february 2001 september 2001 and june 2003 alleging patent infringement 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our security services and communications services than we would otherwise 

  

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

  

furthermore our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple distribution channels failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

principal and interest on the network solutions note may never be repaid 

  

as consideration for our sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 we received a 40 million senior subordinated note from network solutions that matures over five years 

  

from the date of the closing of the sale the note is subordinated to a term loan made by the senior lender to the network solutions business in the principal amount of 40 million as of the closing date in addition to the promissory note we also hold a 15 interest in the network solutions business we may never be repaid for the amount owed under the promissory note and we may never realize any value from our membership interest 

  

compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance is costly and could harm our business 

  

the sarbanesoxley act which was signed into law in july 2002 mandates among other things that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations for example section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their internal controls in addition the nasdaq stock market has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices and our compliance efforts have required significant management attention it has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we have been required to accept reduced coverage and incur substantially higher costs to obtain the reduced level of coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business 

  

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success also depends on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad in addition our stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel which consist of background checks into prospective employees’ criminal and financial histories further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions 

  

we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving verisign at any time in addition we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 

  

new and proposed regulations related to equity compensation will adversely affect our operating results and negatively impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

  

since our inception we have used stock options and other longterm equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages we believe that stock options and other longterm equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use of vesting encourage employees to remain with verisign the financial accounting standards board “fasb” recently issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “ sharebased payment ” which supercedes sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” that will require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants beginning in the third quarter of 2005 this change will have a material negative impact on our reported earnings recording a charge for employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan under sfas no 123 would have increased after tax charges by approximately 1368 million 2159 million and 2218 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition new regulations adopted by the nasdaq stock market requiring stockholder approval for stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future to the 

  

extent that new policies or regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees either of which could materially harm our business 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

verisign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan

overview 

  

verisign inc is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services that enable people and businesses to find connect secure and transact across complex global networks in 2004 our business consisted of two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group prior to 2004 our business included an additional reportable segment the network solutions domain name registrar business which was sold in november 2003 

  

improving economic conditions during 2004 in the us europe and japan led to improved customer spending in each of our principal business segments leading to growth in revenues and deferred revenues it spending for security services and ecommerce activity in our principal geographic markets accelerated as the year progressed and we saw continued growth in domain name registrations and domain name renewals with active domain names ending in  com and  net increasing by 26 during 2004 spending for our services by telecommunications customers in the united states also increased during the year and jamba our europeanbased provider of mobile content services to telecommunications carriers and customers that was acquired in june 2004 contributed approximately 1808 million of revenues during 2004 in the us the communications services group’s results were adversely affected as the pace of consolidations in the domestic telecommunications sector quickened during the year 

  

we derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of products and services sold primarily in the united states europe and japan in the internet services group more than 83 of the revenues during 2004 were derived from the sale of web certificates payment services managed authentication and security services and registry services in the communications services group 82 of the revenues were derived from the sale of calling name services billing services ss7 connectivity signaling services and mobile content services during the same period 

  

for the communications services group we expect growth in mobile content services revenues particularly in new markets such as the us offset somewhat by a decline in connectivity clearing and settlement and billingrelated revenues in the first quarter with a return to moderate growth in such revenues expected in the second quarter consolidations in the telecommunications sector and pricing pressures have the potential to adversely impact the communications services group’s results for the internet services group we expect continued growth in the levels of it spending for security services by our customers in the us europe and japan and growth in global ecommerce activity that we believe will result in revenue and deferred revenue growth for 2005 

  

network solutions sale 

  

on november 25 2003 we completed the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business to pivotal private equity although we retained a 15 interest in the business we will not recognize any revenue from the network solutions business in the future other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to network solutions as a customer

subsequent events 

  

on january 10 2005 we announced that we had executed a definitive agreement to acquire lightsurf technologies inc “lightsurf” under the terms of the agreement we agreed to issue shares of our common stock having a value of approximately 270 million for all of the outstanding capital stock warrants and vested options of lightsurf and to pay certain transactionrelated expenses of lightsurf in addition we will assume all unvested stock options of lightsurf lightsurf is a leading privately held provider of multimedia messaging and interoperability solutions for the wireless market the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including the issuance of a permit from the california department of corporations the transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the first quarter of 2005

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts longlived assets restructuring royalty liabilities and deferred taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred in order to determine current and deferred revenue we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 

  

revenues from our consulting services are recognized using either the percentageofcompletion method or on a timeandmaterials basis as work is performed percentageofcompletion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed revenues from timeandmaterials are recognized as services are performed 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance each customer’s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an 

  

allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above in addition we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer industry or geographic region we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future as of december 31 2004 the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 5 of total accounts receivable or approximately 115 million a change of 1 in our estimate would amount to approximately 21 million 

  

valuation of longlived intangible assets including goodwill 

  

our longlived assets consist primarily of goodwill other intangible assets and property and equipment we review at least annually goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” we review longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” such events or circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

  

recoverability of longlived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled approximately 9692 million at december 31 2004 which was comprised of 7254 million of goodwill and 2438 million of other intangible assets other intangible assets include customer relationships technology in place carrier relationships noncompete agreements trade names and customer lists factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements it is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our longlived intangible assets including goodwill 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

in november 2003 we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units in april 2002 we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully rationalize integrate and align our resources both plans resulted in reductions in workforce abandonment of excess facilities disposal of property and equipment and other charges we expect these restructuring plans to be completed in 2014 upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space including the potential for sublease income estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates changing market conditions by location and considerable work with thirdparty leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis as necessary during 2004 we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately 13 million related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations such estimates will likely be revised in the future if sublease rates continue to change in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional 326 million over the next ten years relating to our restructuring plans 

  

provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights 

  

certain of our mobile content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others where we have not yet entered into a license agreement with a holder we record a provision for royalty payments that we estimate will be due once a license agreement is concluded we estimate the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized our estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property such as a change in demand for a particular type of content in which case we would record a royalty expense materially different than our estimate 

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes under sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” which involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets in concluding that a valuation allowance is required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets we considered such factors as our history of operating losses our uncertainty as to the projected longterm operating results and the nature of our deferred tax assets although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence the possible future reversal of the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through ongoing operations to the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets generated through stock compensation deductions the possible future reversal of such valuation allowance will result in a credit to additional paidin capital and will not result in future income statement benefit

in 2004 we had two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group in 2003 we had three reportable segments the internet services group the communications services group and network solutions as a result of our sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 we do not recognize revenues from this segment other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to network solutions as a customer a comparison of revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is presented below 

  

   

total revenues increased approximately 1117 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to revenue increases in both our internet services group and communications services group partially offset by the loss of revenues as a result of the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business in november 2003 total revenues decreased approximately 1669 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to decreases in both our internet services group and network solutions partially offset by an increase in revenues in our communications services group 

  

internet services group 

  

internet services group revenues increased approximately 1279 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in naming and directory services and security services revenues of approximately 651 million and 628 million respectively naming and directory services revenues increased as a result of recognizing revenues from network solutions that were previously eliminated prior to the sale of this business in addition we experienced an increase in the number of active domain names ending in com and net under management the security services revenue increase was due to increases in managed security services and consulting services revenues of 185 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of guardent in february 2004 and increases in web site digital certificate revenue and secure payments services revenue of 223 million and 102 million respectively 

  

internet services group revenues decreased approximately 885 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decline in security services revenues of approximately 1230 million resulting from the discontinuation of third party product sales and related consulting and support services and a decline in revenues from verisign affiliates of 190 million the decreases in revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues of 101 million from our secure payments services an increase in web site digital certificate revenue of 235 million and an increase in naming and directory services revenues of 208 million 

  

the following table compares active domain names ending in com and net managed by our naming and directory services business the approximate installed base of web site digital certificates in our commerce site services business and the approximate number of active online merchants in our secured payments services business as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

we expect internet services group revenues will continue to grow in 2005 as demand for our naming and directory services and security services is expected to grow 

  

communications services group 

  

communications services group revenues increased approximately 1956 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in mobile content revenues of 1808 million attributable to our acquisition of jamba in june 2004 in addition intelligent database services revenues increased approximately 150 million primarily due to increases in calling name cnam and local and wireless number portability revenues applications services revenues increased 35 million due to increases in messaging services traffic billing and payment services revenues declined 88 million primarily due to pricing reductions for these services and loss of customers due to consolidation in the telecommunications industry clearing and settlement services increased 53 million primarily from increases in revenues from verisign brazil reflecting the inclusion of a full year of revenues from this subsidiary that was acquired in october 2003 

  

communications services group revenues increased approximately 210 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 as a result of an increase in clearing and settlement services revenues of 182 million and an increase in network connectivity and interoperability revenues of 10 million these increases were partially offset by a decline in cnam revenues of 22 million 

  

the following table compares the approximate number of annual database queries and communications services customers as of the end of each year presented 

  

    

we expect communications services group revenues will increase in 2005 principally as a result of growth in mobile content and applications revenues 

  

network solutions 

  

we completed the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 and recognized no revenues from this segment in 2004 we will not recognize any revenue from the network solutions business in the future other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to network solutions as a customer network solutions revenues declined 994 million in 2003 compared to 2002 principally due to weaker demand for new domain name registrations and a decline in total domain names under management active domain names under management were approximately 82 million names as of november 25 2003 the date we sold network solutions compared to 93 million at december 31 2002 in addition the revenue decline reflects the completion of the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 which resulted in 329 days of consolidated revenues for 2003 compared to a full year in 2002 

  

revenues by geographic region 

  

our revenues are broken out into three geographic regions consisting of the americas emea and apac the following table shows a comparison of our revenues by geographic region for each year presented 

  

      

revenues decreased 917 million in the americas region in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily as a result of the sale of network solutions in november 2003 revenues in our emea region increased 1891 million in the same period primarily due to the acquisition of jamba in june 2004 which contributed approximately 1808 million in 2004 in addition increases in our web certificate and managed pki sales in emea also contributed to the increase partially offset by decreases in our verisign affiliate revenue as we continued to move to a direct distribution model through international subsidiaries in certain larger european markets the increase in apac revenues of 142 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily related to increased enterprise security sales in both the japan and australian markets partially offset by a decrease in verisign affiliate revenue 

  

revenues decreased 1671 million in the americas region in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily as a result of the discontinuation of third party product sales and the related support services in the fourth quarter of 2002 the decrease in emea revenues of 61 million in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily related to a decrease in verisign affiliate revenue partially offset by increases in web certificate and managed pki revenues the increase in apac revenues of 63 million in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily related to an increase in enterprise security sales in both the japan and australian markets partially offset by a decrease in verisign affiliate revenue 

  

we expect international revenues will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in 2005 

  

costs and expenses 

  

operating costs and expenses decreased by 2483 million or 19 to 10347 million during fiscal 2004 compared with the prior year this was primarily due to a decrease in the charges we incurred for the amortization and impairment of other intangible assets related to our acquisitions amortization and impairment charges totaled approximately 794 million in 2004 compared to 3355 million in 2003 additionally there were decreases in restructuring and other charges of 499 million offset by increases of 582 million in sales and marketing expenses and 115 million in research and development expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

we restructured our business in april of 2002 and again in november of 2003 as a result of these restructurings and as a result of the sale of our network solutions business we have experienced a significant reduction in overall costs in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

excluding the effects of any future acquisitions or dispositions we expect our employee headcount to increase in 2005 across all business units and corporate services as a result of our acquisition of guardent and jamba we added approximately 700 employees to our overall headcount primarily in the cost of revenues function the sale of our network solutions business in november 2003 resulted in a headcount reduction of 577 employees primarily in the cost of revenues function 

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services payment services operational costs for the domain name registration business customer support and training consulting and development services operational costs related to the management and monitoring of our clients’ network security infrastructures content licensing costs carrier costs for our ss7 and ipbased networks and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities 

  

a comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is presented below 

  

   

cost of revenues decreased approximately 14 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due a decrease of 695 million as a result of the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business which was offset by increases attributable to the acquisitions of jamba and guardent of 498 million and 153 million respectively 

  

cost of revenues decreased 1252 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to our transition out of the thirdparty product reseller and the thirdparty product training businesses this transition accounted for a decrease of approximately 1059 million also compensation costs decreased approximately 96 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to a reduction in employee headcount related to our restructuring plans announced in 2002 and 2003 while contract and professional services fees declined approximately 120 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to the discontinuation of certain outsourced customer service centers for our network solutions registrar business 

  

as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues decreased during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the sale of the network solutions business which was a business with higher costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue than our other two business segments 

  

we anticipate that our overall cost of revenues will increase in 2005 but that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will stay flat or decrease modestly in 2005 primarily due to greater cost efficiencies from our current businesses and recently acquired businesses particularly mobile content services 

  

sales and marketing 

  

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales marketing and policy activities these expenses include salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees and costs of marketing programs such as internet television radio print and direct mail advertising costs 

  

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is presented below 

  

   

sales and marketing expenses increased approximately 582 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to our acquisitions of jamba and guardent which had sales and marketing expenses of 805 million and 88 million respectively that were partially offset by a decrease of 383 million in sales and marketing expenses due to the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business additionally we experienced an increase of approximately 71 million in advertising and marketing costs during this period primarily as a result of increased corporate brand advertising 

  

sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately 528 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a reduction in advertising and marketing spending and a reduction in labor and benefit costs advertising and marketing expenses decreased approximately 225 million in 2003 due to a significant reduction in network solutions marketing campaigns during 2003 labor and benefits costs decreased approximately 198 million in 2003 related to a reduction in employee headcount associated with our restructuring plans additionally contract and professional services expenses decreased approximately 66 million due to an overall reduction in sales and marketing service contracts in 2003 travel expenses decreased approximately 18 million in 2003 due to reduced employee headcount and an overall decrease in international travel as a result of safety concerns stemming from health and terrorism alerts 

  

as a percentage of revenues sales and marketing expenses increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the increase in advertising and marketing spending in 2004 compared to 2003 as described above 

  

we expect increases in overall sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues as we continue to expand in our domestic and international markets for our mobile content services along with our continuing efforts in marketing new products such as unified authentication and related services and increases in our spending for corporate brand advertising 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees and the costs of facilities computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development 

  

a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is presented below 

  

   

research and development expenses increased 115 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to our acquisitions of guardent and jamba research and development spending attributable to these acquired entities was 34 million and 35 million respectively the sale of our network solutions business had no material effect on our research and development expense additionally we experienced an increase of approximately 41 million in increased costs associated with contract and professional services to support new and existing research and development efforts 

  

research and development expenses increased slightly in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase of approximately 75 million was primarily a result of increased spending of approximately 36 million in the communications services group additionally our naming and directory services had increased equipment software and depreciation expenses related to the development of new products and services of approximately 20 million 

  

as a percentage of revenues research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2004 compared to 2003 as described above 

  

we believe that rapid development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our leadership position in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development as a result we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenues in 2005 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel facilities computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense 

  

a comparison of general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is presented below 

  

   

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 35 million in 2004 compared to 2003 overall general and administrative expenses increased from the acquisition of guardent inc and jamba in the amounts of 42 million and 165 million respectively but was offset by a decrease of 98 million in overall expenses due to the sale of our network solutions business 

  

excluding the effects of the acquisitions of guardent and jamba and the sale of our network solutions business the overall decrease in general and administrative costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 was 144 million this was primarily due to a reduction in costs from prior restructuring efforts of approximately 208 million along with other efficiencies from cost reduction efforts of 65 million and a decrease in our bad debt expense of approximately 54 million these decreases were partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately 109 million as a result of costs associated with litigation and increases in contract and professional services of approximately 74 million primarily due to expenses related to sarbanesoxley compliance 

  

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 37 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately 367 million due to increased focus on collection activities 

  

partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately 74 million as a result of defending various lawsuits particularly lawsuits related to the network solutions business and contract and professional services of approximately 61 million primarily due to the development of a companywide strategic planning methodology tax services and increased expenses related to sarbanesoxley compliance additionally depreciation increased 59 million as a result of capital expenditures to upgrade our business systems and labor and benefits increased approximately 58 million due to higher benefit costs also we incurred increased occupancy expenses of approximately 21 million in 2003 due to the expansion of a facility in virginia and increases in business insurance licenses and property taxes of 37 million 

  

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in 2005 will increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of overall revenues we expect that costs associated with sarbanesoxley compliance to decrease slightly during the year and we anticipate to further leverage our general and administrative costs as a result of higher overall revenues 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense and our days sales outstanding “dso” for 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

dso increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily as a result of our acquisition of jamba in june 2004 we expect that dso will be in the range of 40 to 50 days throughout 2005 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

below is a comparison of the restructuring and other charges under the 2003 and 2002 restructuring plans for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

the changes in restructuring and other charges are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives 

  

2003 restructuring plan  in 2003 we announced a restructuring initiative related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units and recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately 542 million in 2004 property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned in 2004 but not related to the sale of the network solutions business resulted in a net charge of approximately 203 million and consisted primarily of obsolete telecommunications computer software and other equipment we also recorded restructuring charges of 27 million related to noncancelable lease costs for excess facilities 11 million related to workforce reduction charges and 10 million for exit costs

below is a comparison of our amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

sfas no 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis sfas no 144 requires that longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset 

  

there was no impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment test conducted in june 2004 

  

the annual impairment test conducted in june 2003 resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets of 1232 million during the second quarter of 2003 verisign recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of 302 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of verisign entering into an agreement to sell its network solutions business the event triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to network solutions after considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture verisign determined that the carrying value exceeded the implied fair value of network solutions’ goodwill total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as allocated to the company’s operating segments for the year ended december 31 2003 are as follows 

  

   

the impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment test resulted in an impairment in 2002 as follows 

  

   

amortization of other intangible assets decreased approximately 1026 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and decreased approximately 1018 million in 2003 compared to 2002 as other intangible assets related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized we acquired approximately 839 million of other intangible assets in connection with our jamba acquisition in june 2004 as a result we expect amortization of other intangible assets to increase to approximately 90 million in 2005 including the impact of all acquisitions through december 31 2004 and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges 

  

see notes 1 and 7 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

other income expense net 

  

other income expense net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments and the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 

  

a comparison of total other income expense for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is presented below 

  

   

total other income net in 2004 consisted primarily of net interest income and other items of 177 million a net gain from the sale of a portion of the company’s holdings in verisign japan and other investments of 798 million partially offset by a net impairment of investments totaling 126 million and a net loss on foreign currency transactions of 29 million in the first and third quarter of 2004 we determined the decline in value of certain nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and we recognized the net impairment losses totaling 126 million described above 

  

total other expense net in 2003 consisted primarily of a net impairment of investments totaling 165 million partially offset by net interest income of 77 million and a gain on foreign currency transactions of 18 million in the first quarter of 2003 we determined the decline in value of certain nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling 165 million 

  

income tax expense 

  

in the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we recorded income tax expense of 276 million or 129 of pretax income 234 million or 99 of pretax loss and 104 million or 02 of pretax loss respectively our effective tax rates differ from the united states federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to state taxes acquisitionrelated expenses the realization of domestic net operating loss capital loss and research credit carryforwards and the impact of foreign operations 

  

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors including the company’s past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to us federal and state operations are realizable the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be increased in the near future if the company exhibits sufficient positive evidence in future periods that demonstrate the continuation of its trend in projected earnings is achievable if the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets were released as of december 31 2004 approximately 2407 million would be credited to the statement of operations 2686 million would be credited to additional paidin capital and 54 million would be credited to goodwill management would continue to apply a valuation allowance of 334 million to the deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards and 489 million to the deferred tax asset relating to the writedown of investments due to the limited carryover life of such tax attributes management does not believe it is more likely than not that 112 million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable therefore a valuation allowance is applied to the deferred tax asset on the remaining foreign operations management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized accordingly a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 6979 million state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 5559 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 490 million if we are not able to use them the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2023 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2005 through 2023 foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire on various dates we had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately 186 million available for carryover to future years and for state income tax purposes of approximately 139 million available for carryover to future years the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire if not utilized in 2010 through 2024 state research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized the tax reform act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership changes 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

at december 31 2004 our principal source of liquidity was 7374 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisting principally of commercial paper medium term investmentgrade corporate notes corporate bonds and notes us government and agency securities and money market funds 

  

working capital increased 3692 million over the periods presented primarily due to an increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 3520 million primarily from net cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 3653 million in 2004 3584 million in 2003 and 2401 million in 2002 the increase in both 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for noncash items such as amortization and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and depreciation of property and equipment additionally cash flows from operating activities increased in 2004 due to an increase in deferred revenues of 693 million an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 449 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 658 million in 2003 an increase in accounts payable of 381 million a decrease in accounts receivable of 280 million an increase in deferred revenue of 255 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 128 million after accounting for the sale of our network solutions business contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 a substantial decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrued liabilities contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared to 2001 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 2849 million in 2004 primarily as a result of 2464 million used for our acquisitions and 159 million used for net purchases of investments in addition we used approximately 925 million for purchases of property and equipment partially offset by 783 million in proceeds from the sale of stock in our verisign japan subsidiary

the following table shows our budgeted capital property and equipment expenditures in 2005 and our actual expenditures in 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

our planned capital property and equipment expenditures for 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 110 million and will primarily be for computer and communications equipment and computer software within all areas of the company our most significant expenditures will be focused on productivity cost improvement and market development initiatives for the internet services group and the communications services group other capital property and equipment expenditures will be for productivity and cost improvement initiatives for corporate services 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december 31 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

  

   

as of december 31 2004 we had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014 see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

future operating lease payments include payments related to leases on excess facilities included in verisign’s restructuring plans the restructuring liability is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms the longest of which extends through 2014 if sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional 326 million over the next ten years relating to our restructuring plans cash payments totaling approximately 605 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next ten years see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans not including other cost savings efforts were estimated to have been approximately 15 to 20 million in 2004 and are estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 million in 2005 

  

in november 1999 we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the tuvalu internet toplevel domain “tv” with the government of tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to 84 million through 2008 

  

we have pledged a portion of our shortterm investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements we have pledged approximately 65 million pursuant to such agreements classified as restricted cash on the accompanying balance sheet as of december 31 2004 in addition we established a trust during the first quarter of 2004 in the amount of 450 million classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet for our director and officer liability selfinsurance coverage 

  

in 2001 our board of directors authorized the use of up to 350 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades during 2003 and 2002 no shares were repurchased however during 2004 we repurchased approximately 44 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 113 million at december 31 2004 approximately 167 million remained available for future repurchases under this program 

  

verisign entered into a fiveyear agreement with bank of america effective june 1 2000 to provide a 15 million unsecured capital expenditure loan facility the loan was paid in full on december 16 2003 

  

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices with a total public offering price not to exceed 750 million to date no shares have been issued under this registration statement 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements this additional funding if needed might not be available on terms attractive to us or at all failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities the percentage of our stock owned by our thencurrent stockholders will be reduced furthermore these equity securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “ sharebased payment ” which requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations the accounting provisions of sfas 123r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt sfas 123r in the third quarter of 2005 the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition see “ stock compensation plans and unearned compensation ” in note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts for 2002 through 2004 as if we had used a fairvaluebased method similar to the methods required under sfas 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas 123r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas 123r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1091 “fas 1091” “ application of fasb statement no 109  “ accounting for income taxes” to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 ” the ajca introduces a special 9 tax deduction on qualified production activities fas 1091 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with sfas 109 pursuant to the ajca we will not be able to claim this tax benefit until the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1092 “fas 1092” “ accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of 2004 ” the ajca introduces a limited time 85 dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision provided certain criteria are met fas 1092 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision we do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf issue no 031 “eitf 031” “ the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments ” which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments additionally eitf 031 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired in september 2004 the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf 031 however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june 15 2004 

  

we do not expect the adoption of eitf 031 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

equity investments 

  

we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes in most instances we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market and therefore carry a high level of risk these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the nearterm therefore these companies may never become publicly traded even if they do an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments in 2004 2003 and 2002 we determined the decline in value of certain public and nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling 82 million 165 million and 1625 million respectively due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments and in light of current stock market conditions we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

the primary objective of our cash management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving aftertax returns some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to interest rate risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value to minimize interest rate risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper mediumterm notes corporate bonds and notes us government and agency securities and money market funds in general money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate as of december 31 2004 38 of our cash investments mature in less than one year if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at december 31 2004 this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 

  

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2004 this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk 

  

   

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks in the fourth quarter of 2003 we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange 

  

risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies the primary objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months 

  

at december 31 2004 we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately 545 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies all hedge contracts are recorded at fair market value we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with highquality financial institutions

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within verisign have been detected

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we market our services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including the internet direct sales telesales direct marketing through all media mass merchandisers valueadded resellers systems 

  

integrators and our verisign affiliates we intend to increase our direct sales force in the internet services group and the communications services group both in the united states and abroad and to expand our other distribution channels in both businesses 

  

our direct sales and marketing organization at december 31 2003 consisted of approximately 600 individuals including managers sales representatives marketing technical and customer support personnel we have field sales offices throughout the world additionally our sales are currently being made through multiple channels including wholesale and retail distributors resellers and direct sales throughout the world 

  

we believe our customer base is diversified and is not concentrated in any particular industry in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenues 

  

research and development 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 300 employees dedicated to research and development research and development expenses were 558 million in 2003 484 million in 2002 and 781 million in 2001 to date all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred we believe that timely development of new and enhanced internet security ecommerce naming and directory and communications services and technologies are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue recruiting and hiring experienced research and development personnel and to make additional investments in research and development 

  

our future success will depend in large part on the ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we have developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties including public key cryptography technology from rsa security inc “rsa” although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally or acquired through business acquisitions 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

competition in security services  our security services are targeted at the rapidly evolving market for trusted services including authentication validation and payment which enable secure electronic commerce and communications over wired and wireless ip networks although the competitive environment in this market has yet to develop fully we anticipate that it will be intensely competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 

  

principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as rsa security and entrust technologies which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as geo trust and digital signature trust company a subsidiary of zions bancorporation that primarily offer digital certificate and certification authority or ca related services and 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as betrusted we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore netscape and microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products 

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future 

  

competition in managed security services  consulting companies or professional services groups of other companies with internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our managed security services these companies include large systems integrators and consulting firms such as accenture formerly andersen consulting ibm global services and lucent netcare we also compete with security product companies that offer managed security services in addition to other security services such as symantec and iss as well as a number of providers such as ubizen and redsiren that offer managed security services exclusively in addition we compete with some companies that have developed products that automate the management of ip addresses and name maps throughout enterprisewide intranets and with companies with internally developed systems integration efforts 

  

competition in communications services the market for communications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure competition in this area arises from two primary sources large incumbent carriers provide competing services in their regions as a result of regulatory requirements to promote competition in addition we face direct competition on a nationwide basis from unregulated companies including telecommunications services inc or tsi and other carriers such as southern new england telephone a unit of sbc communications our wireless billing services also compete with services offered by boston communications group amdocs convergys corporation and tsi furthermore customers are increasingly likely to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services which may reduce the demand for technologies and services from third party providers such as verisign and further increase competitive pricing pressures 

  

competition in registry services in november 2000 icann announced selections for several new gtlds that directly compete with the com and net gtlds as well as the cctlds offered by us the gtlds biz and info  were launched in 2001 the gtlds launched in 2002 and 2003 include name pro aero museum and coop  these gtlds are available for registration through icann accredited registrars in addition we currently face competition from the over 240 cctld registry operators who compete directly for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence 

  

we also face competition from registry service providers that offer outsourced dns and registration services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neulevel affilias registercom and tucowscom 

  

competition in digital brand management services we face competition from companies providing services similar to some of our digital brand management services in the monitoring services registration and domain name asset management area of our business our competition comes primarily from icann accredited registrars and various smaller companies providing similar services 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressure 

  

new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not 

  

adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

industry regulation 

  

naming and directory services within the us government leadership for the continued privatization of internet administration is currently provided by the department of commerce 

  

on november 10 1999 we entered into a series of wideranging agreements these agreements included the following 

  

   

   

   

   

our registry agreement with icann was replaced by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com  one for net and one for org  the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007 with a 4year renewal option the term of the net registry agreement extends until june 30 2005 at which time the net registry services will be put out for competitive bid by icann a process in which we will be allowed to participate the org registry agreement terminated on december 31 2002 and the org registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by icann during 2003 

  

the description of these agreements are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are filed as exhibits to the periodic reports indicated in the index to the exhibits contained in part iv of this annual report on form 10k 

  

security services some of our digital trust services utilize and incorporate encryption technology exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the united states and various nonunited states governments verisign has obtained approval to export many of the digital trust services we provide to customers globally under applicable united states export law including our server digital certificate service as the list of products and countries for which export approval is expanded or changed particularly in response to the terrorist acts of september 11 2001 verisign will increase the scrutiny of and further government restrictions on exportation of software products utilizing encryption technology if we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell some of our digital trust services in international markets 

  

there are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certification authorities but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to certification authorities if we do not comply with these state laws and regulations we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us moreover if our market for digital certificates grows the united states federal state or foreign governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certification authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services these regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could impact our business 

  

communications services one service provided by the communications services group is currently subject to federal communications commission “fcc” regulation this service allows wireless users who are “roaming” in areas where their home carrier has not made arrangements for automatic roaming service to complete calls to domestic and international destinations the communications services group has been authorized by the fcc to provide this service further our communications customers are subject to fcc regulation which indirectly affects our communications services business we cannot predict when or upon what terms and conditions further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or deregulation on our business several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services which may increase our costs of operations in addition future services we may provide could be subject to direct government regulation 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of documentation and other proprietary information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the united states and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices the national or international patent offices may not award any patents with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded they may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property 

  

we have obtained us and foreign trademark registrations for various verisign marks we have also filed numerous applications to register verisign trademarks and claims and have common law rights in many other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s marks 

  

with regard to our security services business we also rely on certain licensed thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography technology licensed from rsa and other technology that is used in our security services to perform key functions rsa has granted us a perpetual royaltyfree nonexclusive worldwide license to use rsa’s products relating to certificate issuing management and processing functionality we develop services that contain or incorporate the rsa bsafe products and that relate to digital certificateissuing software software for the management of private keys and for digitally signing computer files on behalf of others software for customers to preview and forward digital certificate requests to them rsa’s bsafe product is a software tool kit that allows for the integration of encryption and authentication features into software applications 

  

with regard to our payment services business we rely on proprietary software and technology covering many aspects of ecommerce transactions such as electronic funds transfers and multicurrency transactions in addition we have strategic relationships with third parties involved in ecommerce transactions such as issuing banks and financial processors and those agreements provide us with intellectual property rights with respect to performing those services 

  

with regard to our naming and directory services business our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our registry service business and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and internetbased products and services businesses including the conversion of internationalized domain names we own our proprietary shared registration system through which competing registrars submit com and net secondlevel domain name registrations some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors 

  

with regard to our communications services group we offer a wide variety of services including networking database and billing services each of which are protected by trade secret patents andor patent applications we have also entered into agreements with thirdparty providers and licensors 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 2500 fulltime employees of the total approximately 1100 were employed in operations approximately 600 in sales and marketing approximately 300 in research and development and approximately 500 in finance and administration including information services personnel we have never had a work stoppage and no usbased employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be good our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 

  

segment information 

  

during 2003 we operated our business in three reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group both of which are described above and the network solutions business segment through which we provided domain name registration and value added services such as business email websites hosting and other web presence services effective november 25 2003 when we completed the sale of our network solutions business to pivotal private equity we realigned our operations into two servicebased business segments consisting of the internet services group and the communications services group prior to 2003 we operated our business in two reportable segments the enterprise and service provider division and the mass markets division segment information based on our current organizational structures is set forth in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements referred to in item 8 below 

  

factors that may affect future results of operations 

  

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions 

  

adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to downturns in the telecommunications and technology industries and may continue to impact our business resulting in 

  

   

   

   

recent political turmoil in many parts of the world including terrorist and military actions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate further we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 

  

our limited operating history under our current business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results 

  

we were incorporated in april 1995 and began introducing our services in june 1995 we completed several acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 including our acquisitions of network solutions and illuminet holdings and in february 2002 we completed our acquisition of ho systems in november 2003 we sold our network solutions domain name registrar business network solutions illuminet holdings and ho systems operated in different businesses from our thencurrent business therefore we have only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects our success will depend on many factors many of which are not entirely under our control including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

to address these risks we must among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the business environment is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

  

security services  we anticipate that the market for services that enable trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over ip networks will remain intensely competitive we compete with larger and smaller companies that provide products and services that are similar to some aspects of our security services our competitors may develop new technologies in the future that are perceived as being more secure effective or cost efficient than the technology underlying our security services 

  

registry services  seven new generic toplevel domain registries aero biz coop info museum name and pro recently began accepting domain name registrations icann has indicated that it plans to start a process to consider opening additional generic toplevel domains since we do not act as a registry for these new toplevel domains we do not receive the annual registry fee for domain name registrations under these toplevel domains the commencement of registrations in these new toplevel domains may reduce demand for com and net domain name registrations if the new toplevel domains reduce the demand for domain name registrations in com and net  our business could be materially harmed 

  

communications services  we face competition from large wellfunded regional providers of ss7 network services and related products such as regional bell operating companies tsi and southern new england telephone a unit of sbc communication our wireless billing services compete with services offered 

  

by boston communications group amdocs convergys corporation and tsi we are also aware of major internet service providers software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete directly with ours 

  

we expect that competition will increase in the near term and that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market increased competition could result in pricing pressures reduced margins or the failure of one or more of our services to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources as a result we may not be able to compete effectively 

  

our communications services business depends on the acceptance of our ss7 network and the telecommunications market’s continuing use of ss7 technology 

  

our future growth in our communications services business depends in part on the commercial success and reliability of our ss7 network our ss7 network is a vital component of our intelligent network services which had been a significant source of revenues for our illuminet inc subsidiary our communications services business will suffer if our target customers do not use our ss7 network our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced ss7based services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our particular ss7 network solution or continue to use our ss7 network in the future we may not be successful in marketing our ss7 network or any new or enhanced services 

  

the inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our business 

  

significant technical challenges exist in our signaling and network services business because many of our customers 

  

   

   

   

customer implementation currently requires participation by our order management and our engineering and operations groups each of which has limited resources some customers may also require us to develop costly customized features or capabilities which increase our costs and consume a disproportionate share of our limited customer service and support resources also we typically charge onetime flat rate fees for initially connecting a customer to our ss7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the connection is established if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our engineering service support we may experience reduced operating margins our customers’ ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and integrate them successfully within their systems depends on our customers’ capabilities and the complexity involved difficulty in deploying those services could reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause potential delays in recognizing revenues until the services are implemented 

  

our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our signaling and intelligent network services at desired pricing levels could adversely impact our revenues and cash flow 

  

the telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price competition competition and industry consolidation in our communications services could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion 

  

in our market share pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in the selling price of our services for example our competitors may provide customers with reduced communications costs for internet access or private network services reducing the overall cost of services and significantly increasing pricing pressures on us we would need to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of our customers generating higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs and we may not be able to do so successfully we believe that the business of providing network connectivity and related network services will see increased consolidation in the future consolidation could decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries which could erode our market share revenues and operating margins in our communications services group consolidation in the telecommunications industry has led to the merging of many companies our business could be harmed if these mergers result in the loss of customers by our communications services group furthermore customers may choose to deploy internally developed communications technologies and services thereby reducing the demand for technologies and services offered by verisign which could harm our business 

  

our business depends on the future growth of the internet and adoption and continued use of ip networks 

  

our future success depends in part on growth in the use of the internet and ip networks if the use of and interest in the internet and ip networks does not grow our business would be harmed to date many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the internet and ip networks for a number of reasons including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the widespread acceptance of the internet and ip networks will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging information organizations that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods also individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting payments may be reluctant to change 

  

a number of states as well as the us congress have been considering various initiatives that could permit sales and use taxes on internet sales if any of these initiatives are adopted it could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and therefore hinder the growth in the use of the internet and ip networks which could harm our business 

  

our target markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products and services are not widely accepted in these markets our business could suffer 

  

we target our security services at the market for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks these are rapidly evolving markets that may not continue to grow 

  

accordingly the demand for our services is very uncertain even if the markets for electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks grow our services may not be widely accepted the factors that may affect the level of market acceptance and consequently our services include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

if the market for electronic commerce and communications over ip and other networks does not grow or our security services are not widely accepted in the market our business would be materially harmed 

  

our inability to introduce and implement technological changes in our industry and successfully introduce new products and services could harm our business 

  

the emerging nature of the internet digital certificate domain name registration and payment services markets and their rapid evolution require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings we must also introduce new services as quickly as possible the success of new services depends on several factors including proper new service definition and timely completion introduction and market acceptance we may not succeed in developing and marketing new services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs this could harm our business 

  

the communications network services industry is also characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements significant technological changes could make our technology obsolete we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the responsiveness reliability and features of our network and by developing new network features services and applications to meet changing customer needs we cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a costeffective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share we sell our ss7 network services primarily to traditional telecommunications companies that rely on traditional voice networks many emerging companies are providing convergent internet protocolbased network services our future success could also depend upon our ability to provide products and services to these internet protocolbased telephony providers particularly if ipbased telephony becomes widely accepted 

  

new products and services developed or introduced by us may not result in any significant revenues we must commit significant resources to develop new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept for example our selection in january 2003 by epcglobal a notforprofit standards organization to operate the object naming service as the root directory for the epcglobal network may not increase our revenues in the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunities develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products services and technologies developed by others will not render our products services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our inability to successfully market new products and services may harm our business 

  

issues arising from our agreements with icann and the department of commerce could harm our registry business 

  

the department of commerce or doc has adopted a plan for a phased transition of the doc’s responsibilities for the domain name system to the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers or 

  

icann as part of this transition our registry agreement with icann was replaced by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com  one for net and one for org  the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007 with a 4year renewal option the term of the net registry agreement extends at least until november 10 2003 and possibly until june 30 2005 provided certain specified criteria are met at which time the net registry services will be put out for competitive bid by icann a process in which we will be allowed to participate the org registry agreement terminated on december 31 2002 and the org registry services were transitioned to a new registry operator selected by icann during 2003 we face risks from this transition including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

on february 26 2004 we announced that we had filed a lawsuit against icann in the central district of california the lawsuit alleges that icann overstepped its contractual authority and improperly attempted to regulate our business in violation of icann’s charter and its agreements with us we cannot predict the affect this lawsuit will have on our relationship with icann 

  

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our domain name registry business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including other domestic and foreign governmental authorities to our role in the ongoing privatization of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

for example we are a defendant in four lawsuits filed since september 18 2003 relating to our site finder service and we have temporarily suspended our site finder service in response to a formal request by icann in october 2003 as a result of these challenges it may be difficult for us to introduce new services in our domain name registry business and we could also be subject to additional restrictions on how this business is conducted 

  

we have faced difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with acquisitions 

  

we made several acquisitions in the last five years and may pursue acquisitions in the future we have experienced difficulty in and in the future may face difficulties integrating the personnel products technologies or operations of companies we acquire assimilating acquired businesses involves a number of other risks including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future acquisitions our business could be harmed 

  

additionally there is risk that we may incur additional expenses associated with an impairment of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions for acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and to evaluate other intangible assets as events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired these evaluations could result in further impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 

  

some of our investments in other companies have resulted in losses and may result in losses in the future 

  

we have investments in a number of companies in most instances these investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market these companies are typically in the early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses therefore these companies may never become publicly traded even if they do an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments further if these companies are not 

  

successful we could incur charges related to writedowns or writeoffs of these types of assets during 2003 we recorded net losses due to investment impairments of 165 million during 2002 we determined that the decline in value of some of our public and private equity security investments was otherthantemporary and recognized a net loss of 1625 million related to the decline in value of these investments due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments and in light of current stock market conditions we may incur future losses on the sales or impairments of our investments 

  

in addition as consideration for our sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 we received a 40 million senior subordinated note from network solutions that matures over five years from the date of the closing of the sale the note is subordinated to a term loan made by the senior lender to the network solutions business in the principal amount of 40 million as of the closing date in addition to the promissory note we also hold a 15 membership interest in the network solutions business we may never be repaid for the amount owed under the promissory note and we may never realize any value from our membership interest 

  

our failure to manage past and future growth in our business could harm our business 

  

between december 31 1995 and december 31 2003 we grew from 26 to approximately 2500 employees this was achieved through internal growth as well as acquisitions during this time period we opened new sales offices and significantly expanded our us and nonus operations to successfully manage past growth and any future growth we will need to continue to implement additional management information systems continue the development of our operating administrative financial and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our executive engineering accounting finance marketing sales and operations organizations any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business 

  

if we encounter system interruptions we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in mountain view california and kawasaki japan both of which are susceptible to earthquakes providence rhode island dulles virginia lacey washington overland park kansas and melbourne australia any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business 

  

in addition our ability to issue digital certificates and our domain name registry services depend on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and from our registrar customers to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of web browsers internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction which could harm our business 

  

a failure in the operation of our domain name zone servers the domain name root servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time 

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system the root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure 

  

despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our services such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

our signaling and network services reliance on thirdparty communications infrastructure hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control 

  

our signaling and network services success will depend on our network infrastructure including the capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers in particular we rely on att mci sprint and other telecommunications providers for leased longhaul and local loop transmission capacity these companies provide the dedicated links that connect our network components to each other and to our customers our business also depends upon the capacity reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect telephone calls specifically we currently lease capacity from regional providers on six of the fifteen mated pairs of ss7 signal transfer points that comprise our network we have no control over the operation quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future our operations could be severely interrupted in addition rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies these mergers may cause the availability pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services that we use to increase significantly we rely on links equipment and software provided to us from our vendors the most important of which are gateway equipment and software from tekelec and agilent technologies inc we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure product availability with these vendors we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products and services 

  

capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use 

  

if traffic from our telecommunication customers through our network increases we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software we may not be able to expand and upgrade in a timely manner our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network if we do not appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software we may lose customers and revenues 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a volunteer basis because of the importance to the functioning of the internet of these root zone servers our registry services business could be harmed if these volunteer operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our registry services business could be harmed if any of these volunteer operators fail to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and to the extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server system as provided in our registry agreement with icann it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the toplevel domain zone servers designated by us if icann does not do this our business could be harmed 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our enterprise security services and communications services than we would otherwise 

  

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships particularly in the use and promotion of ip networks for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications and on the ability of these parties to market our services successfully 

  

furthermore our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple distribution channels failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our services could harm our business if we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

some of our services have lengthy sales and implementation cycles 

  

we market many of our security services directly to large companies and government agencies and we market our communications services to large telecommunication carriers the sale and implementation of our services to these entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources this process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers’ internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital expenditures deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations as a result the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain of our services can be lengthy potentially lasting from three to six months our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business the performance of our services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on thirdparty applications and services that utilize our services which could result in legal claims against us harming our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

services offered by our internet services group rely on public key cryptography technology that may compromise our system’s security 

  

services offered by our internet services group depend on public key cryptography technology with public key cryptography technology a user is given a public key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and that it is not lost stolen or otherwise compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as “factoring” this integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult should an easy factoring method be developed the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing pki services obsolete or unmarketable if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business in the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this negative public perception could harm our business 

  

the expansion of our international operations subjects our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for approximately 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 we intend to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities for example we expect to expand our operations and marketing activities throughout asia europe and latin america expansion into these markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets failure to do so could harm our business in addition there are risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure of verisign affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

we have licensed to verisign affiliates our processing center platform which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the affiliate to offer backend processing of pki services for enterprises the verisign processing center platform provides a verisign affiliate with the knowledge and technology to offer pki services similar to those offered by us it is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the verisign affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and customer service and support these practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control any failure of a verisign affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over ip networks generally 

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends on our internally developed technologies and other intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the united states in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology that is used in our products and services to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 

  

or at all our business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies a thirdparty could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could delay the introduction of our internet infrastructure services until equivalent technology if available is identified licensed and integrated this could harm our business 

  

we could become subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property of others which could be costly to defend and which could harm our business 

  

claims relating to infringement of intellectual property of others or other similar claims have been made against us in the past and could be made against us in the future any claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel cause delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us we could be required to pay damages or have portions of our business enjoined if we could not develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for example we have had complaints filed against us in february 2001 september 2001 and june 2003 alleging patent infringement see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and could harm our business 

  

the sarbanesoxley act which was signed into law in july 2002 mandates among other things that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations for example section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their internal controls in addition the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is traded has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations will increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations it has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we have been required to accept reduced coverage and incur substantially higher costs to obtain the reduced level of coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business 

  

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success also depends on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad in addition our stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel which consist of background checks into prospective employees’ criminal and financial histories further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions 

  

we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving verisign at any time in addition we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 

  

new and proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

  

since our inception we have used stock options and other longterm equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages we believe that stock options and other longterm equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use of vesting encourage employees to remain with verisign the financial accounting standards board “fasb” among other agencies and entities is currently considering changes to us gaap that if implemented would require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants this proposal would negatively impact our earnings for example recording a charge for employee stock options under statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” would have increased after tax loss by approximately 216 million 222 million and 256 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively in addition new regulations adopted by the nasdaq stock market requiring stockholder approval for stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future to the extent that new policies or regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees either of which could materially harm our business 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

verisign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan

on june 30 2003 idn technologies llc filed a complaint alleging patent infringement against verisign in the united states district court for the northern district of california asserting infringement of us patent no 6182148 b1 idn technologies filed an amended complaint on august 6 2003 alleging infringement of the same patent but adding an additional verisign service verisign responded by filing a counterclaim for declaratory relief and an answer denying any infringement and asserting that the patent is invalid the complaint alleges that certain verisign “software” that converts domain names in nonascii format into ascii format infringes idn technologies’ patent the complaint requests judgment in favor of idn technologies a permanent injunction from infringement treble damages and attorneys’ fees and costs discovery in the case is now proceeding and is scheduled to close on january 19 2005 the parties have exchanged infringement and

verisign is involved in various other investigations claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business none of which in our opinion will harm its business verisign cannot assure that it will prevail in any litigation regardless of the outcome any litigation may require verisign to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention

overview 

  

verisign inc is a leading provider of critical infrastructure services that enable web site owners enterprises communications service providers electronic commerce or ecommerce service providers and individuals to engage in secure digital commerce and communications in 2003 our business consisted of three reportable segments the internet services group the communications services group and the network solutions domain name registrar business 

  

the economic environment during the first half of 2003 was challenging across all segments of our business but began to improve in certain sectors during the third and fourth quarters as the year progressed we noted improved it spending in the united states europe and japan and saw a general rebound in ecommerce globally these developments led to a return to growth in revenues and deferred revenues in our internet services group’s security services payment services and naming and directory services businesses these trends were offset however by a continued deterioration in market share in our network solutions domain name registrar business due to ongoing competition from other accredited registrars further the telecommunications industry had another difficult year due to an excess of capacity which resulted in increased pricing pressures for our communications services group’s offerings and increased rates of business consolidation in the sector many second tier carriers continued to have financial difficulties and several telecommunications customers filed for bankruptcy during 2003 we were also unable to renew our contract with dobson a sizable wireless billing customer due to its affiliation with another telecommunications provider utilizing a competitive system 

  

we derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of products and services sold primarily in the united states europe and japan in the internet services group more than 70 of the revenues during 2003 were derived from the sale of web certificates payment services managed pki services and registry services in the communications services group over 75 of our revenues were derived from the sale of calling name services billing services ss7 connectivity and signaling services during 2003 as for our network solutions domain name registrar business which we sold in late 2003 virtually all revenues for this business unit were derived from the sale of our domain name registration services 

  

during 2004 we expect to see continued modest improvements in the level of it and telecommunications spending and ecommerce activity in the united states europe and japan for the year we anticipate a decline in verisign’s overall revenues due to the sale of our network solutions business with moderate growth in revenues in the internet services group and flat to moderate growth in revenues in the communications services group 

  

network solutions sale 

  

on november 25 2003 we completed the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business to pivotal private equity we received approximately 98 million of consideration consisting of approximately 58 million in cash and a 40 million senior subordinated note that bears interest at 7 per annum for the first three years 9 per annum thereafter and matures five years from the date of closing the principal and interest are due upon maturity this note is subordinated to a term loan made by ableco finance to the network solutions business in the principal amount of approximately 40 million as of the closing date we retained a 15 equity stake in the network solutions business we will not recognize any revenue from the network solutions business in the future and accordingly we expect the sale of the business will result in a decline in proforma and us gaap net revenues of between 140 and 160 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and will reduce proforma operating profits between 12 and 20 million and us gaap operating losses between 90 million and 98 million in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

the network solutions business provides domain name registrations and value added services such as business email websites hosting and other web presence services approximately 580 former verisign employees are now employed by the network solutions business as a result of the transaction in connection with the sale we assigned the lease for our facility located in drums pennsylvania to the purchaser and subleased certain facilities located in herndon virginia to the purchaser 

  

verisign japan kk initial public offering 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2003 verisign’s majority owned consolidated subsidiary verisign japan kk completed an initial public offering of its common stock approximately 374 million was raised by verisign japan kk from the initial public offering and through subsequent option exercises during the fourth quarter of 2003 verisign japan kk’s shares began trading on the tokyo stock exchange “tse” on november 19 2003 under the company code 3722 

  

acquisitions 

  

in october 2003 we completed our acquisition of uncembratel the clearinghouse division of embratel for approximately 16 million uncembratel provides call record tracking clearing and settlement services for a majority of the mobile and fixed telecommunications carriers in brazil the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the date of acquisition the results of uncembratel’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from its date of acquisition 

  

in february 2002 we completed our acquisition of ho systems inc a provider of billing and customer care solutions to wireless carriers we paid approximately 350 million in cash for all of the outstanding stock of ho systems the total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date ho system’s results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements from its date of acquisition 

  

we accounted for all of our acquisitions in 2003 2002 and 2001 as purchase business combinations accordingly the acquired companies’ revenues costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition additionally the results of operations of the network solutions domain name registrar business have been excluded from our consolidated results of operations since we finalized the sale of the business on november 25 2003 as a result of our sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business in 2003 our acquisitions of ho systems in february 2002 and illuminet holdings in december 2001 comparisons of revenues costs and expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 to the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 may not be relevant as the businesses represented in the consolidated financial statements were not equivalent 

  

subsequent events 

  

on february 26 2004 we successfully completed our acquisition of guardent a leading privately held provider of managed security services we paid approximately 135 million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of guardent of which approximately 65 million was in cash and the remainder in verisign stock the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase transaction 

  

prior to the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business verisign and network solutions were defendants in numerous lawsuits related to customer disputes over domain name registrations and related services from january 1 2004 through march 8 2004 verisign resolved six lawsuits directly related to the network solutions business totaling approximately 10 million this amount has been included in sale of business and litigation settlements on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

  

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts longlived assets and deferred taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

during 2003 verisign derived its revenues from three reportable segments i the internet services group which consists of the security services business and the naming and directory services business the security services business provides products and services that enable enterprises and organizations to establish and deliver secure internetbased services to customer and business partners and the naming and directory services business acts as the exclusive registry of domain names in the com and net generic toplevel domains or gtlds and certain country code toplevel domains or cctlds ii the communications services group which provides signaling system 7 or ss7 network services intelligent data base and directory services application services and billing and payment services to wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers and iii domain name registration services through the network solutions business segment which verisign sold in november 2003 verisign’s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “ revenue recognition  unless otherwise noted below the revenue recognition policy for each of these categories is as follows 

  

internet services 

  

revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate generally 12 months revenues from the sale of managed public key infrastructure “pki” services are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license generally 12 to 36 months postcontract customer support “pcs” is bundled with managed pki services licenses and recognized over the license term 

  

revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including pcs training and other services these licenses which do not provide for right of return are primarily perpetual licenses for which revenues are recognized upfront once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

  

we recognize revenues from issuances of digital certificates and business process licensing to verisign affiliates in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 when all of the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectibility is probable we define each of these four criteria as follows 

  

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a written contract which is signed by both the customer and us or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 

  

delivery has occurred our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer electronic delivery is deemed to have occurred upon download by the customer from an ftp server if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 

  

the fee is fixed or determinable it is our policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of their paid license fees we may agree to payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs generally at least 80 of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable 

  

collectibility is probable collectibility is assessed on a customerbycustomer basis we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection new customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customer’s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process revenues are recognized as cash is collected 

  

during 2003 revenues for all verisign affiliates represented approximately 2 of consolidated revenues 

  

our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to pcs and professional services components of our perpetual license arrangements we sell our professional services separately and have established vsoe on this basis vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer’s annual renewal rates for these elements accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop 989 

  

our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services which are generally billed on a timeandmaterials or milestoneachieved basis 

  

revenues from consulting services are recognized using either the percentageofcompletion method or on a timeandmaterials basis as work is performed percentageofcompletion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed revenues from training are recognized as training is performed 

  

revenues from managed security services primarily consist of a setup fee and a monthly service fee for the managed security service in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “revenue recognition”  revenues from setup fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned revenues from the monthly service fees are recognized in the period in which the services are provided our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with sab no 101 as amended by sab no 104 unless otherwise noted 

  

revenues from thirdparty product sales are recognized when title to the products sold passes to the customer our shipping terms generally dictate that the passage of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the customer 

  

revenues from payment services primarily consist of a setup fee and a monthly service fee for the transaction processing services revenues from setup fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned revenues from the service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided 

  

communications services 

  

revenues from communications services are comprised of network connectivity intelligent network services wireless billing and customer care services and clearinghouse services network connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to our ss7 network and trunk signaling services revenues from network connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees and trunk signaling service revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a customer signals intelligent network services which include calling card validation local number portability wireless services tollfree database access and caller identification are derived primarily from database administration and database query services and are charged on a peruse or perquery basis revenues from prepaid wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue retained by us and recognized in the period in which such calls are processed on a perminute or percall basis revenues from wireless billing and customer care services primarily represent a monthly recurring fee for every subscriber activated by our wireless carrier customers 

  

clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a distribution and collection point for billing information and payment collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another clearinghouse services revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are amounts due from customers that are related to our telecommunications services for thirdparty network access data base charges and clearinghouse toll amounts that have been invoiced and remitted to the customer 

  

domain name registration services 

  

domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services revenues from the initial registration or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term generally one to two years and up to ten years 

  

domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on renewal and collection rates customers are notified of the expiration of their registration in advance and we record the receivables and related deferred revenue for estimated renewal fees in the month preceding the anniversary date of their registration when we have a right to bill under the terms of our domain name registration agreements the variance between the actual collections and the rate used to estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the setting of renewal rates for prospective periods fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences these fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term ranging from one to ten years 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance each customer’s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above in addition we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer industry or geographic region to date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that if not collected would have a significant impact on our operating income we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future as of december 31 2003 the allowance for doubtful accounts represented 14 of total accounts receivable a change of 1 in our estimate would amount to approximately 1 million 

  

valuation of longlived intangible assets including goodwill 

  

our longlived assets consist primarily of goodwill other intangible assets and property and equipment we review at least annually goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we review longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” such events or circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

  

recoverability of longlived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 618 million at december 31 2003 which was comprised of 401 million of goodwill and 217 million of other intangible assets other intangible assets include customer relationships technology in place and customer lists factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period 

  

the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements it is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our longlived intangible assets including goodwill based on these measurements we recorded impairment charges of approximately 123 million and 4611 million during 2003 and 2002 respectively additionally the agreement we entered into to sell our network solutions business triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to network solutions after considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of network solutions’ goodwill as a result we recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of approximately 30 million in the third quarter of 2003 

  

restructuring 

  

in november 2003 we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units the plan resulted in reductions in workforce abandonment of excess facilities disposal of property and equipment and other charges as a result of the 2003 restructuring plan and in conformity with sfas no 146 and sfas no 112 we incurred restructuring and other charges amounting to approximately 542 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

in april 2002 we initiated plans to restructure our operations to rationalize integrate and align resources this restructuring plan included workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities writeoff of abandoned property and equipment and other charges as a result of this plan in conformity with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 100 and eitf issues no 943 and 8810 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 205 million during 2003 and 886 million during 2002 

  

deferred taxes 

  

we account for deferred taxes under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets in concluding that a valuation allowance is required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets we considered such factors as our history of operating losses our uncertainty as to the projected longterm operating results and the nature of our deferred tax assets although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence the possible future reversal of the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through ongoing operations to the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets generated through stock compensation deductions the possible future reversal of such valuation allowance will result in a credit to additional paidin capital and will not result in future income statement benefit 

  

results of operations 

  

we had net losses for fiscal 2003 of approximately 260 million a decrease of 4701 million compared to our losses in fiscal 2002 our net losses were due primarily to the charges we have incurred for the amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions and restructuring charges the reduction in net losses for 2003 compared to 2002 is the result primarily of a decrease in the amounts amortized and impaired a comparison of the amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets amortized and impaired and restructuring charges in 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented below 

  

   

partially offsetting the reduction in amounts amortized and impaired was a decline in revenues of 1669 million or 14 for 2003 compared to 2002 the decrease in revenues principally reflects declining revenues of approximately 994 million or 32 from the network solutions domain name registrar business and approximately 885 million or 17 from our internet services group for 2003 compared to 2002 these revenue declines were partially offset by an increase of revenues of approximately 210 million or 5 from our communications services group for 2003 compared to 2002 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 217 billion primarily due to the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately 220 billion related to our acquisitions amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately 584 million in 2004 including the impact of all acquisitions through december 31 2003 and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges 

  

the following is a discussion of revenues for each of verisign’s segments 

  

revenues 

  

in 2003 we had three reportable segments internet services group communications services group and network solutions a comparison of revenues for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented below 

  

   

total revenues decreased 14 in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a 32 decrease in network solutions revenues and a 17 decrease in internet services group revenues partially offset by a 5 increase in communications services group revenues total revenues increased 24 in 2002 compared to 2001 consisting of a 3217 increase in communications services group revenues and a 4 increase in internet services group revenue partially offset by 33 decrease in network solutions revenues 

  

internet services group 

  

internet services group revenues decreased 89 million or 17 in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decline in security services revenues of approximately 123 million resulting from the discontinuation of third party product sales and related consulting and support services and a decline in revenues from verisign affiliates of 19 million the decreases in revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues of 10 million for payment services an increase in pki and ssl certificate revenues of 23 million and an increase in naming and directory services revenues of 21 million at the end of 2003 naming and directory services as the exclusive registry of domain names within the com and net gtlds and certain cctlds had an active base of approximately 304 million domain names under management compared to approximately 258 million names at the end of 2002 

  

revenues for our internet services group increased slightly in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to growth in the number of online merchants using our payment services and growth in the total number of domain names under management by our registry services 

  

the following table shows a comparison of the approximate installed base of web site digital certificates at the end of each of the last three years 

  

   

the following table shows a comparison of total domain names under management ending in com and net by our naming and directory services business and the approximate number of active online merchants in our payment services business at the end of each of the last three years 

  

   

communications services group 

  

communications services group revenues increased 210 million or 5 in 2003 as compared to 2002 as a result of an increase in billing and payment services revenues of 182 million and an increase in ss7 signaling and connectivity revenues of 10 million these increases were partially offset by a decline in caller name revenues of 22 million at the end of 2003 we had 1177 communications services customers compared to 1035 customers at the end of 2002 

  

communications services group revenues increased 374 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily due to our acquisitions of illuminet holdings in december 2001 and ho systems in february 2002 

  

the following table shows a comparison of the approximate number of daily database queries and the number of communications services customers as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

network solutions 

  

network solutions revenues declined 99 million or 32 in 2003 compared to 2002 principally due to weaker demand for new domain name registrations and a decline in total domain names under management active domain names under management were approximately 82 million names as of november 25 2003 the date we sold network solutions compared to 93 million at december 31 2002 in addition the revenue decline reflects the completion of the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business on november 25 2003 which resulted in 329 days of consolidated revenues for 2003 compared to a full year in 2002 the sale of network solutions on november 25 2003 is estimated to have represented approximately 15 to 20 million of the 99 million decrease in revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 we will not recognize any revenue from the network solutions business in the future and accordingly we expect the sale of the business will result in a decline in proforma and us gaap net revenues of between 140 and 160 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and will reduce proforma operating profits between 12 and 20 million and us gaap operating losses between 90 million and 98 million in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

in 2001 network solutions experienced a decrease in the number of new names and the nonrenewal of names paid for which contributed to a decline in deferred revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 resulting in a decrease in revenues recognized in 2002 as compared to 2001 

  

international revenues 

  

revenues from our international subsidiaries increased 240 million or 41 in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to increased web certificate and managed pki sales in europe and asia revenues from our verisign affiliates decreased 191 million or 47 in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to a decline in the number of new licensing agreements entered into with and in royalty payments received from verisign affiliates our direct international sales primarily consist of direct sales to international communication services customers in 2003 we began transitioning our international strategy in certain larger european markets to move from a distribution model through our verisign affiliates to a direct distribution model through our international subsidiaries the result was an increase in web certificates sold internationally in 2003 compared to 2002 revenues from our international subsidiaries increased 199 million or 51 in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to web certificate and managed pki services growth in europe and asia revenues from verisign affiliates decreased 427 million or 51 in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to a decline in new licensing agreements resulting in lower royalty revenues 

  

on a percentage basis revenues from our international subsidiaries accounted for 8 of total revenues in 2003 5 in 2002 and 4 in 2001 revenues from our verisign affiliates accounted for 2 of total revenues in 2003 3 in 2002 and 8 in 2001 revenues from direct international sales accounted for 1 of total revenues in 2003 1 in 2002 and less than 1 in 2001 the increase in revenues from international subsidiaries on a percentage basis in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the decline in revenues for the network solutions registrar business and to the disposition of the business in november 2003 as network solutions’ revenues were attributed to the united states because it is impracticable to determine the country of origin for domain name registration revenues the decrease in revenues from verisign affiliates on a percentage basis in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the decline in verisign affiliate revenues from 402 million in 2002 to 212 million in 2003 

  

the percentage decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the acquisitions of illuminet holdings in december 2001 and ho systems in february 2002 whose revenues are derived principally from customers located in the united states additionally a decline in the number of new licensing agreements entered into with and royalty payments received from verisign affiliates resulted in a decrease in international revenues in 2002 of 427 million partially offset by increased in revenues from international subsidiaries of 199 million and an increase in direct international sales of 69 million 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our international revenues as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

as a result of our decision to transition our international strategy in certain larger markets in europe from a distribution model through the verisign affiliates to a direct distribution model through its international subsidiaries and as a result of the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business whose revenues were attributed to the united states we expect international revenues will increase to 12 to 15 of total revenues in 2004 

  

costs and expenses 

  

operating costs and expenses decreased by 4740 million or 79 to 1283 million during fiscal 2003 compared with the prior year the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the charges we incurred for the amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions amortization and impairment charges totaled approximately 336 million in 2003 compared to 4895 million in 2002 also contributing to the decline in operating expenses were decreases in cost of revenues of 1252 million sales and marketing expenses of 528 million and restructuring and other charges of 139 million in 2003 compared to 2002 

  

we announced plans to restructure our business in april of 2002 and again in october of 2003 as a result of these restructuring plans and as a result of the sale of our network solutions business we have experienced a significant reduction in overall costs in 2003 compared to 2002 including a reduction in labor and benefit costs 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function as of the end of each year presented 

  

   

excluding the effects of any future acquisitions or dispositions we expect our employee headcount to increase slightly in 2004 across all business units and corporate services as a result of our acquisition of guardent inc which closed on february 26 2004 we added approximately 160 employees to our employee headcount the sale of our network solutions business in november 2003 resulted in a headcount reduction in cost of revenues of 436 employees sales and marketing of 87 employees and general and administrative of 54 employees for a total of reduction of 577 employees 

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services payment services operational costs for the domain name registration business customer support and training consulting and development services carrier costs for our ss7 and ipbased networks and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities in addition with respect to our digital certificate services cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify certificate applicants’ identities insurance premiums for our service warranty plan errors and omission insurance and the cost of software and hardware resold to customers 

  

a comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented below 

  

   

on an absolute dollar basis cost of revenues decreased 1252 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 the primary reason for this decrease was due to our transition out of the thirdparty product reseller and the thirdparty product training businesses this transition accounted for a decrease of approximately 1059 million also labor and benefits costs decreased approximately 96 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to a reduction in employee headcount related to our restructuring plans announced in 2002 and 2003 contract and professional services fees declined approximately 120 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to a discontinuation in 2003 of certain outsourced customer service centers for our network solutions registrar business 

  

as a percentage of revenues cost of sales decreased modestly during 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to our transition out of the thirdparty product reseller and the thirdparty product training businesses which typically have higher costs and lower margins than our internal products and services additionally fixed labor and benefit costs declined as a result of the reduction in employee headcount in 2003 relating to our restructuring plans 

  

growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of revenues on an absolute dollar basis in 2002 as compared to 2001 we acquired illuminet holdings in december 2001 and ho systems in february 2002 which added significant cost of revenues during 2002 we incurred increased expenses for access to thirdparty databases to verify digital certificate applicants’ identities increased customer service costs related to our larger customer base and increased expenses related to the cost of hardware and software products resold to customers as part of our consulting business registry fees thirdparty fees other direct costs and labor are our largest expense categories for cost of revenues the acquisition of illuminet holdings resulted in an increase in labor expenses of 354 million in 2002 and an increase of 1245 million for thirdparty fees and other direct costs additionally depreciation expenses in cost of revenues increased due to the illuminet acquisition by 313 million in 2002 compared to 2001 while overall our cost of revenues increased we reduced outside consulting costs by 104 million in 2002 from 2001 due to a companywide cost reduction effort future acquisitions further expansion into international markets and introduction of new products may result in additional increases in cost of revenues due to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses and other factors 

  

cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased significantly during 2002 compared to 2001 due to the inclusion of a full year of activity from our illuminet holdings acquisition and due to over 10 months of activity from our ho systems acquisition our communications services businesses have different cost structures than our other businesses resulting in an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues since their acquisitions 

  

certain of our services such as consulting and training require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types of services in addition revenues derived from our authentication services domain name registration services registry services payment services and our communications services each have different cost structures and our overall cost of revenues may fluctuate as these businesses mature we anticipate that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will decrease modestly in 2004 due to the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business whose cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was generally higher than our other businesses 

  

sales and marketing 

  

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing and policy activities these expenses include salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees and costs of marketing programs such as internet television radio print and direct mail advertising costs 

  

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented below 

  

   

sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately 528 million on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a reduction in advertising and marketing spending and a reduction in labor and benefit costs advertising and marketing expenses decreased approximately 225 million in 2003 due to a significant reduction in network solutions marketing campaigns during 2003 labor and benefits costs decreased approximately 198 million in 2003 related to a reduction in employee headcount associated with our restructuring plans additionally contract and professional services expenses decreased approximately 66 million due to an overall reduction in sales and marketing service contracts in 2003 travel expenses decreased approximately 18 million in 2003 due to reduced employee headcount and an overall decrease in international travel as a result of safety concerns stemming from health and terrorism alerts as a percentage of revenues sales and marketing expenses declined slightly in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decrease in advertising and marketing spending in 2003 compared to 2002 

  

sales and marketing expenses decreased on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to a substantial reduction in expenditures for advertising and related promotional activities particularly with respect to network solutions and from a decrease in allocated lease expenses advertising and related promotional expenditures declined by over 447 million due to a heightened effort to control spending in conjunction with our restructuring plan announced in april 2002 in an effort to decrease the use of external vendors for sales and marketing efforts we increased our internal labor expenses during 2002 this increase partially offsets the savings noted above the decrease in allocated lease expenses is a result of our purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view california in october of 2001 on an absolute dollar basis our acquisitions of illuminet holdings and ho systems in december 2001 and february 2002 respectively partially offset the decrease in spending for advertising and related promotional activities and allocated lease expenses during 2002 these acquisitions resulted in an additional 121 million of sales and marketing labor expenses for 2002 as compared to 2001 additionally we incurred increased depreciation expense during 2002 compared to 2001 due to the depreciation of our headquarters facility and other property and equipment expenditures during 2002 

  

we have continued to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues over the threeyear period presented this is primarily due to the increase in recurring revenues from existing customers which tend to have lower retention costs the restructuring plans we have put into place in 2003 and 2002 the sale of our network solutions business in 2003 and an increase in productivity of our direct and inside sales forces in 2004 we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease on an absolute dollar basis and to remain unchanged on a percentage of revenues basis as a result of the sale of our network solutions business 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees and the costs of facilities computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development 

  

a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented below 

  

   

research and development expenses increased slightly in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 the absolute dollar increase of approximately 75 million was primarily a result of increased spending of approximately 36 million in the communications services group additionally the naming and directory services group had increased equipment software and depreciation expenses related to the development of new products and services of approximately 20 million 

  

as a percentage of revenues research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2003 compared to 2002 and due to a decrease in revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 

  

research and development expenses decreased in 2002 from 2001 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues the absolute dollar decrease is related to a substantial decrease in allocated lease expenses resulting from our purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view california in october 2001 and from benefits realized as a result of our restructuring plan additionally during 2001 we incurred overall higher expenses for the design testing and deployment of our security service offerings as compared to 2002 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development as a result we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in absolute dollars and on a percentage of revenues basis in the future to date we have expensed all research and development expenditures as incurred 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance information technology and human resources personnel facilities and computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense 

  

a comparison of general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented below 

  

   

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 37 million on an absolute dollar basis in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by increases in contract and professional services higher labor and benefit costs increased depreciation expenses and additional legal expenses bad debt expense decreased approximately 367 million in 2003 due to increased focus on collection activities 

  

the following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense for 2003 2002 and 2001 and our days sales outstanding “dso” as of the end of the years presented 

  

   

we expect dso will be in the 40 to 50 day range throughout 2004 the expected increase results from the sale of the network solutions business whose dso was lower than our other business units 

  

the decrease in general and administrative costs in 2003 was partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately 74 million as a result of defending various lawsuits particularly lawsuits related to the network solutions business and contract and professional services of approximately 61 million primarily due to the development of a companywide strategic planning methodology tax services and increased expenses related to sarbanesoxley compliance additionally depreciation increased 59 million as a result of capital expenditures to upgrade our business systems and labor and benefits increased approximately 58 million due to higher benefit costs also we incurred increased occupancy expenses of approximately 21 million in 2003 due to the expansion of a facility in virginia and increases in business insurance licenses and property taxes of 37 million 

  

as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expenses increased in 2003 due primarily to the decrease in revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 

  

general and administrative expenses increased in 2002 from 2001 on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to our acquisitions of illuminet holdings and ho systems in december 2001 and february 2002 respectively these acquisitions resulted in a net increase in general and administrative expenses of 233 million during 2002 of which 90 million was labor expenses in addition bad debt expense increased to 427 million in 2002 compared to 269 million in 2001 primarily as a result of the continued deterioration in the overall economy legal expense increased by 32 million for 2002 and insurance costs increased 19 million primarily due to an increase in renewal premium rates in 2002 as compared to 2001 depreciation expense increased modestly during 2002 resulting from the depreciation of our headquarters facility and other property and equipment expenditures during 2002 increases in our general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreases in lease expenses resulting from the purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view california in october 2001 and the benefits realized from our restructuring plan announced in april 2002 these benefits included reduction in general and administrative outside consulting expenses of 134 million and travel expenses of 21 million for 2002 the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is due to the fact that consolidated revenues increased at a faster rate than general and administrative expenses over the same periods as a result of our acquisitions of illuminet holdings and ho systems 

  

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease on an absolute basis in 2004 due to the sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

2003 restructuring plan 

  

in october 2003 we announced a restructuring initiative related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units the initiative resulted in reductions in workforce abandonment of excess facilities disposals of property and equipment and other charges as a result of the 2003 restructuring plan and in conformity with sfas no 146 and sfas no 112 we incurred restructuring and other charges amounting to approximately 542 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

workforce reduction the 2003 restructuring plan resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 100 employees in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recognized workforce reduction charges of approximately 57 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 

  

excess facilities we recorded charges of approximately 283 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 for excess facilities located in the united states and europe that were either abandoned or downsized relating to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs to determine the lease loss which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing an abandoned building or separable portion thereof certain estimates were made related to the 1 time period over which the relevant space would remain vacant 2 sublease terms and 3 sublease rates including common area charges if sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional 26 million over the next eleven years related to the 2003 restructuring plan 

  

exit costs we recorded other exit costs primarily relating to the realignment of our communications services business these charges totaled approximately 10 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

other charges property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned in the fourth quarter of 2003 but not related to the sale of the network solutions business resulted in a net charge of approximately 184 million and consisted primarily of obsolete telecommunications computer software and other equipment additionally other costs not related to the sale of network solutions amounted to 07 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

restructuring and other charges recorded during the year ended december 31 2003 relating to the 2003 restructuring plan are as follows 

  

   

as of december 31 2003 the accrued liability associated with the 2003 restructuring plan was 324 million and consisted of the following 

  

   

2002 restructuring plan 

  

in april 2002 we announced plans to restructure our operations to rationalize integrate and align resources this restructuring plan included workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities writeoff of abandoned property and equipment and other charges as a result of this plan in conformity with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 100 and eitf issues no 943 and 8810 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 205 million during 2003 and 886 million during 2002 

  

workforce reduction our 2002 restructuring plan resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees across certain business functions operating units and geographic regions workforce reduction charges of approximately 15 million and 62 million were recorded in 2003 and 2002 respectively relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 

  

excess facilities we recorded charges of approximately 87 million and 297 million during 2003 and 2002 respectively for excess facilities that were either abandoned or downsized relating to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs if sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional 2 million over the next five years relating to the 2002 restructuring plan 

  

exit costs we recorded other exit costs consisting of the writeoff of prepaid license fees associated with products that were originally intended to be incorporated into our product offerings but were subsequently abandoned as a result of the decision to restructure these charges totaled approximately 10 million during 2003 and 90 million during 2002 

  

other charges as part of our efforts to rationalize integrate and align resources we also recorded other charges of 92 million during 2003 including 109 million paid for the termination of a lease and 93 million for the writeoff of computer software we recorded other charges of 186 million during 2002 relating primarily to the writeoff of prepaid marketing assets associated with discontinued advertising property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned resulted in a net charge of approximately 250 million during 2002 and consisted primarily of computer software leasehold improvements and computer equipment 

  

restructuring and other charges net of adjustments recorded during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 associated with the 2002 restructuring plan are as follows 

  

   

as of december 31 2003 the accrued liability associated with the 2002 restructuring plans was 162 million and consisted of the following 

  

   

reversals and adjustments to restructuring and other charges of 109 million in 2003 is the result of an assignment of a building lease in the united kingdom to an unrelated third party and due to a favorable renegotiation of a building lease in herndon va 

  

amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms the longest of which extends through 2014 

  

future cash payments and anticipated sublease income related to lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities are expected to be as follows 

  

   

cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans not including other cost savings efforts were estimated to have been 55 to 60 million in 2003 and are estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 million in 2004 

  

amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

in 2003 in accordance with statement of accounting standards sfas no 142 and sfas no 144 we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions of approximately 336 million compared to 4895 million in 2002 the decrease in amounts amortized and impaired in 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to our 2002 annual test for impairment which resulted in the impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately 4611 million excluding impairment writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization expense was approximately 182 million in 2003 compared to 284 million in 2002 amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately 584 million for 2004 including the impact of all acquisitions through december 31 2003 and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges 

  

our annual test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2003 resulted in an impairment of the net book value as follows 

  

   

additionally the sale of our network solutions business segment in 2003 triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to network solutions after considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of network solutions’ goodwill as a result we recorded an impairment of goodwill of 302 million in the third quarter of 2003 

  

in 2002 in accordance with sfas no 142 and sfas no 144 we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions of approximately 4895 million compared to 13570 million in 2001 excluding impairment writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization expense was approximately 284 million in 2002 compared to 3678 million in 2001 the decrease in amortization expense excluding impairments in 2002 from 2001 is due primarily to the effects of the provisions of sfas no 142 in which goodwill is no longer amortized 

  

our annual test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002 resulted in an impairment of the net book value as follows 

  

   

sfas no 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis sfas no 144 requires that longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset see notes 1 and 7 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

prior to our adoption of sfas no 142 on january 1 2002 our policy was to assess the recoverability of goodwill using estimated undiscounted cash flows those cash flows included an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of its goodwill amortization period 

  

other expense net 

  

other expense net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments and the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 

  

a comparison of total other income expense for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented below 

  

   

total other expense net in 2003 consisted primarily of a net impairment of investments totaling 165 million partially offset by net interest income of 77 million and a gain on foreign currency transactions of 18 million in the first quarter of 2003 we determined the decline in value of certain nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling 165 million although our cash and cash equivalents short and longterm investments and restricted cash totaled 7638 million at the end of 2003 compared to 4406 million at the end of 2002 interest rate yields have declined substantially resulting in a decrease in interest income in 2003 compared to 2002 

  

total other expense in 2002 was primarily comprised of an impairment of investments totaling 1625 million on certain public and nonpublic equity security investments partially offset by 142 million of interest and other income in 2002 we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and nonpublic equity securities investments was otherthantemporary and we recorded a net impairment of these investments totaling 1625 million our cash cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments decreased to 4406 million at december 31 2002 from 9285 million at december 31 2001 primarily due to the acquisition of ho systems purchases of property and equipment and the decline in value and subsequent impairment of investments during 2002 these actions resulted in a decrease in interest income earned during 2002 as compared to 2001 

  

income tax benefit expense 

  

in the years ended december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 we recorded income tax expense of 234 million and 104 million respectively we have not recorded a benefit for us federal and state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization as of december 31 2003 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 6244 million state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 5154 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 757 million if we are not able to use them the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2022 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2005 through 2023 foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire on various dates we had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of 

  

approximately 62 million available for carryover to future years and for state income tax purposes of approximately 62 million available for carryover to future years the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire if not utilized in 2010 through 2023 state research and experimental tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized the tax reform act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership changes 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

at december 31 2003 our principal source of liquidity was 7237 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisting principally of commercial paper medium term investmentgrade corporate notes corporate bonds and notes market auction securities us government and agency securities and money market funds 

  

working capital increased 3879 million over the periods presented primarily due to an increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 3382 million primarily from net cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 3584 million in 2003 2401 million in 2002 and 2275 million in 2001 the increase in both 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for noncash items such as amortization and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets depreciation of property and equipment and the impairment of certain investments additionally cash flows from operating activities benefited in 2003 due to an increase in deferred revenues of 255 million an increase in accounts payable of 381 million a decrease in accounts receivable of 280 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 128 million after accounting for the sale of our network solutions business in 2002 a substantial decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrual liabilities contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared to 2001 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 3042 million in 2003 primarily as a result of 4464 million used for purchases of short and longterm investments and 1080 million for purchases of property and equipment these purchases were partially offset by proceeds of 2180 million from maturities and sales of short and longterm investments additionally 576 million of cash was provided from the sale of our network solutions subsidiary in november 2003 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 2825 million in 2002 primarily as a result of 3486 million used for acquisitions including 3463 million for the acquisition of ho systems along with an additional 536 million used in acquisition related costs during 2002 we also used 1321 million for purchases of short and longterm investments and 1762 million for purchases of property and equipment these purchases were partially offset by proceeds of 4236 million from maturities and sales of short and longterm investments 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 3891 million in 2001 primarily as a result of 13 billion used for purchases of investments which were offset by proceeds of 14 billion from sales and maturities of investments 3803 million used for purchases of property and equipment including approximately 285 million used for the purchase of the land and buildings for our corporate headquarters in california and 526 million paid net of cash acquired for business combinations 

  

the following table shows our budgeted capital equipment expenditures in 2004 and our actual expenditures in 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

our planned capital expenditures for 2004 are primarily for computer and communications equipment and computer software within our communications services group our most significant expenditures are focused on productivity and cost improvement initiatives and market development initiatives for the internet services group and the communications services group and productivity and cost improvement initiatives for corporate services as of december 31 2003 we also had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014 see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we also expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 10 to 20 million in the first quarter of 2004 due to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units in addition cash payments totaling approximately 25 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next eleven years see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans not including other cost savings efforts were estimated to have been approximately 55 to 60 million in 2003 and are estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 million in 2004 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 559 million in 2003 203 million in 2002 and 108 million in 2001 in 2003 374 million of cash was provided from the sale of subsidiary stock as a result of verisign japan kk’s initial public offering of common stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 and through subsequent option exercises additionally in 2003 317 million was provided by common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises partially offset by 132 million for the repayment of debt and other longterm obligations in 2002 and 2001 cash was provided primarily from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises in 2001 these proceeds were partially offset by the use of approximately 70 million to repurchase shares of our common stock 

  

in 2001 our board of directors authorized the use of up to 350 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades during 2001 we repurchased approximately 1650000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 70 million during 2003 and 2002 no shares were repurchased and at december 31 2003 approximately 280 million remained available for future repurchases under this program 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements this additional funding if needed might not be available on terms attractive to us or at all failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities the percentage of our stock owned by our thencurrent stockholders will be reduced furthermore these equity securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 

  

we lease a portion of our facilities under operating leases we also sublease a portion of our office space to third parties in addition in november 1999 we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the tuvalu internet toplevel domain “tv” with the government of tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to 106 million over the next five years 

  

as of december 31 2003 our future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases and our future minimum sublease income are as follows 

  

   

we have pledged a portion of our shortterm investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements as of december 31 2003 the amount of shortterm investments we have pledged pursuant to such agreements was approximately 184 million 

  

the restructuring accrual is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms the longest of which extends through 2014 

  

if sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional 28 million over the next eleven years relating to our restructuring plans 

  

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices with a total public offering price not to exceed 750 million to date no shares have been issued under this registration statement 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “ revenue recognition” which codifies revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 101 “ revenue recognition”  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations the changes noted in sab no 104 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin “arb” no 51” in december 2003 the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 46 and interpretation of arb opinion no 51 “fin 46r” fin 46r clarifies the application of arb 51 “ consolidated financial statements ” to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties including the equity holders fin 46r requires the consolidation of these entities known as variable interest entities “vie’s” by the primary beneficiary of the entity the primary beneficiary is the entity if any that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both 

  

among other changes the revisions of fin 46r a clarified some requirements of the original fin 46 which had been issued in january 2003 b eased some implementation problems and c added new scope exceptions fin 46r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after march 15 2004 except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered “specialpurpose entities” in practice and under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin 46r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december 15 2003 

  

among the scope expectations companies are not required to apply fin 46r to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a “business” as defined in the interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist fin 46r applies immediately to a vie created or acquired after january 31 2003 we do not have any interests in vie’s and the adoption of fin 46r is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

equity investments 

  

we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for strategic business purposes some of these companies may be publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices we value these public company investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month these investments are subject to market price volatility we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” component of stockholders’ equity in most instances we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market and therefore carry a high level of risk these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the nearterm therefore these companies may never become publicly traded even if they do an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments in 2003 2002 and 2001 we determined the decline in value of certain public and nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling 165 million 1625 million and 870 million respectively due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments and in light of current stock market conditions we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments we do not currently hedge against equity price changes 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

the primary objective of our nonstrategic investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at december 31 2003 this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper mediumterm notes corporate bonds and notes market auction securities us government and agency securities and money market funds in general money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate in addition we generally invest in relatively shortterm securities as of december 31 2003 58 of our nonstrategic investments mature in less than one year 

  

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2003 this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 

  

   

foreign currency management and derivative instruments 

  

we are increasingly exposed to currency risk as we continue to expand our international operations we transact business in multiple foreign currencies in the fourth quarter of 2003 we initiated a foreign currency risk 

  

management program using forward currency contracts to eliminate reduce or transfer selected foreign currency risks that are related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations denominated in nonfunctional currencies and which could be identified and quantified forward contracts are limited to durations of less than 12 months at december 31 2003 only nonfunctional currency balances were hedged all derivatives were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and in earnings at year end 2003 

  

the primary business objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates at december 31 2003 we held a forward contract in a notional amount of 15 million to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations for certain foreign operations we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor do we hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign contracts with highquality financial institutions 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

not applicable 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

based on their evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as of december 31 2003 have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in this annual report on form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms for form 10k 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within verisign have been detected

as part of our operations infrastructure for our domain name registry services we operate all thirteen gtld servers that answer domain name lookups for the com and net zones we also operate two of the thirteen root zone servers including the “a” root which is the authoritative root zone server of the internet’s domain name system “dns” the domain name servers provide the associated name server and ip address for every com and net domain name on the internet and a large number of other toplevel domain queries resulting in an average of over 75 billion responses per day during 2002 these name servers are located around the world providing local domain name service throughout north america in europe and in asia each server facility is a controlled and monitored environment incorporating security and system maintenance features this network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the internet’s dns infrastructure 

  

to provide our telecommunications services we operate an ss7 network composed of specialized switches computers and databases strategically located across the united states these elements interconnect our customers and us telecommunications carriers through leased lines our network currently consists of 14 mated pairs of ss7 signal transfer points that are specialized switches that manage ss7 signaling and into which our customers connect we own eight pairs and lease capacity on six pairs of ss7 signal transfer points from regional partners our ss7 network control located in overland park kansas is staffed 24 hours a day seven days per week as part of our operations infrastructure for network services we also have several ss7 network signal transfer point sites these sites are maintained at 14 locations throughout the united states

marketing sales and distribution 

  

we market our services worldwide through multiple distribution channels including the internet direct sales telesales direct marketing through all media mass merchandisers valueadded resellers systems integrators and our verisign affiliates a significant portion of our network solutions revenues to date has been generated through sales from our web sites we intend to increase our direct sales force in the internet services group and the telecommunication services group both in the united states and abroad and to expand our other distribution channels in both businesses 

  

our direct sales and marketing organization at december 31 2002 consisted of approximately 700 individuals including managers sales representatives marketing and technical and customer support personnel we have field sales offices throughout the world additionally our sales are currently being made through multiple channels including wholesale and retail distributors resellers and direct sales throughout the world 

  

we believe our customer base is diversified and is not concentrated in any particular industry in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenues 

  

research and development 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 400 employees dedicated to research and development research and development expenses were 484 million in 2002 781 million in 2001 and 413 million in 2000 to date all development costs have been expensed as incurred we believe that timely development of new and enhanced internetbased trust services and technology are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue recruiting and hiring experienced research and development personnel and to make additional investments in research and development 

  

our future success will depend in large part on the ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we have developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties including public key cryptography technology from rsa security inc “rsa” although we will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development 

  

efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing services and new services will be developed internally 

  

the markets for our services are dynamic characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors 

  

competition 

  

competition in security services  our security services are targeted at the new and rapidly evolving market for trusted services including authentication validation and payment that enable secure electronic commerce and communications over wired and wireless ip networks although the competitive environment in this market has yet to develop fully we anticipate that it will be intensely competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 

  

principal competitors generally fall within one of the following categories 1 companies such as baltimore technologies and entrust technologies which offer software applications and related digital certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as geo trust and digital signature trust company a subsidiary of zions bancorporation that primarily offer digital certificate and certificate authority or ca related services and 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as baltimore technologies which acquired gte cybertrust we also experience competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore netscape and microsoft have introduced software products that enable the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other companies could introduce similar products additionally rsa has entered into the digital certificate market and our business could be harmed by rsa’s competition 

  

in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and services in their web browsers or on their web sites could also promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure we cannot assure that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our security services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition the market for digital certificates is emerging and is characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 

  

competition in managed security services we face competition from companies providing managed security services including guardent and ubizen as well as competition from network security product companies like symantec internet security systems trusecure and redsiren in addition we also compete against large systems integrators and consulting firms such as ibm global services and eds 

  

competition in digital brand management services we face competition from companies providing services similar to some of our digital brand management services in the registration and domain name asset management area of our business our competition comes from registercom among other companies in monitoring services competition comes from various smaller companies providing similar services 

  

  

competition in registry services in november 2000 icann announced selections for several new gtlds that once launched will directly compete with the com and net gtlds as well as the cctlds offered by us the gtlds biz and info  were launched in 2001 the latest gtlds launched in 2002 or expected to be launched in 2003 include name pro aero museum and coop  these gtlds are available for registration through icann accredited registrars in addition we currently face competition from the over 240 cctld registry operators who compete directly for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to establish a web presence 

  

we also face competition from registry service providers that offer outsourced dns and registration services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neulevel affilias registercom and tucowscom 

  

competition in telecommunications services the market for telecommunications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure competition in this area arises from two primary sources large incumbent carriers provide competing services in their regions as a result of regulatory requirements to promote competition in addition we face direct competition on a nationwide basis from unregulated carriers including telecommunications services inc or tsi and southern new england telephone a unit of sbc communications our prepaid wireless services also compete with services offered by boston communications group amdocs convergys corporation and tsi 

  

competition in domain name registration and valueadded services the domain name registration service market is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure we currently face competition among registrars within the gtlds like  com net and org and in the future will face competition among registrars within all new toplevel domains as of february 28 2003 there were over 180 icannaccredited registrars our competitors include bulkregistercom deutsche telekom france telecomtranspac godaddy software melbourne it registercom and tucowscom inc that register secondlevel domain names in com  net org and the other gtlds we also face competition from thirdlevel domain name providers such as internet access providers and registrars of cctlds the market for cctlds is largely dominated by other providers especially providers domiciled in the home country of major cctlds such as  de and  uk in addition we face substantial competition from other providers of valueadded web presence services such as email providers web site designers internet service providers web hosting companies and others 

  

several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressure 

  

industry regulation 

  

domain name registration the cooperative agreement which network solutions entered into with the national science foundation in december 1992 provided that we would perform internet domain name registration services for the toplevel domains or tlds com net org edu and gov  with the onset of increased commercial growth of the internet the us government initiated activity directed at increased privatization of the policymaking and central administration of the internet within the us government leadership for the continued privatization of internet administration is currently provided by the department of commerce 

  

  

on november 10 1999 we entered into a series of wideranging agreements these agreements included the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our registry agreement with icann was replaced by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com  one for net and one for org  the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007 with a 4year renewal option the term of the net registry agreement extends at least until november 10 2003 and possibly until june 30 2005 provided certain specified criteria are met at which time the net registry services will be put out for competitive bid by icann a process in which we will be allowed to participate by its terms the org registry agreement was terminated on december 31 2002 at which time we began to transition the org registry services to a new registry operator selected by icann 

  

the description of these agreements are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are filed as exhibits to the periodic reports indicated in the index to the exhibits contained in part iv of this annual report on form 10k 

  

pki services some of our security services incorporate encryption technology exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the united states and various nonunited states governments although we have obtained approval to export our server digital certificate service and none of our other digital trust services are currently subject to export controls under united states law the list of products and countries for which export approval is required could be revised in the future to include more digital certificate products and related services it is possible that the terrorist acts of september 11 2001 and subsequent events will increase the scrutiny of and further government restrictions on exportation of software products utilizing encryption technology if we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell some of our digital trust services in international markets 

  

there are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certificate authorities but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to certificate authorities if we do not comply with these state laws and regulations we will lose the statutory benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us moreover if our market for digital certificates grows the united states federal state or foreign governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certificate authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related services these regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations could harm our business 

  

telecommunications services one service provided by the telecommunication services group is currently subject to federal communications commission “fcc” regulation this service allows wireless users who are “roaming” in areas where their home carrier has not made arrangements for automatic roaming service to complete calls to domestic and international destinations the telecommunication services group has been authorized by the fcc to provide this service further our telecommunications customers are subject to fcc regulation which indirectly affects our telecommunications services business we cannot predict when or upon what terms and conditions further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or 

  

deregulation on our business several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services which may increase our costs of operations in addition future services we may provide could be subject to direct government regulation 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality andor assignment agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of documentation and other proprietary information 

  

we have been issued numerous patents in the united states and abroad covering a wide range of our technology additionally we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technology in the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices the national or international patent offices may not award any patents with respect to these applications 

  

we have obtained us and foreign trademark registrations for various verisign marks we have also filed numerous applications to register verisign trademarks and claims and have common law rights in many other proprietary names we take steps to enforce and police verisign’s marks 

  

with regard to our security services we also rely on certain licensed thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography technology licensed from rsa and other technology that is used in our security services to perform key functions rsa has granted us a perpetual royaltyfree nonexclusive worldwide license to use rsa’s products relating to certificate issuing management and processing functionality we develop services that contain or incorporate the rsa bsafe products and that relate to digital certificateissuing software software for the management of private keys and for digitally signing computer files on behalf of others software for customers to preview and forward digital certificate requests to them rsa’s bsafe product is a software tool kit that allows for the integration of encryption and authentication features into software applications 

  

with regard to our domain name registration services our principal intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon proprietary software used in our registration service business and certain methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registration services and internetbased products and services businesses including the conversion of internationalized domain names we own our proprietary shared registration system through which competing registrars including our registrars submit com and net secondlevel domain name registrations some of the software and protocols used in our registration services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors 

  

with regard to our payment services business we rely on proprietary software and technology covering many aspects of ecommerce transactions such as electronic funds transfers stored value cards and multicurrency transactions in addition we have strategic relationships with third parties involved in ecommerce transactions such as issuing banks our strategic relationships are governed by agreements that set out our intellectual property rights 

  

with regard to our telecommunication services we offer a wide variety of services including networking database and billing services each of which are protected by trade secret patents andor patent applications we have entered into agreements with thirdparty providers and licensors to provide full services to our customers 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 3200 fulltime employees of the total approximately 1500 were employed in operations approximately 700 in sales and marketing approximately 400 in research 

  

and development and approximately 600 in finance and administration including information services personnel we have never had a work stoppage and no employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be good our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense particularly for software development personnel 

  

segment information 

  

historically we have operated our business in two segments the enterprise and service provider division and the mass markets division beginning in the first quarter of 2003 verisign realigned its business segments the new servicebased business segments consist of the internet services group the telecommunication services group and network solutions described above segment information based on our previous structure that was in effect throughout 2002 2001 and 2000 is set forth in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements referred to in item 8 below and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

factors that may affect future results of operations 

  

in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

our telecommunications services business depends on the acceptance of our ss7 network and the telecommunications market’s continuing use of ss7 technology 

  

our future growth depends in part on the commercial success and reliability of our ss7 network our ss7 network is a vital component of our intelligent network services which had been an increasing source of revenues for our illuminet holdings subsidiary our network services business will suffer if our target customers do not use our ss7 network our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced ss7based services we are not certain that our target customers will choose our particular ss7 network solution or continue to use our ss7 network in the future we may not be successful in marketing our ss7 network or any new or enhanced services rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies our business could be harmed if these mergers result in the loss of customers by our telecommunication services group 

  

the inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our business 

  

significant technical challenges exist in our signaling and network services business because many of our customers 

  

   

   

   

customer implementation currently requires participation by our order management and our engineering and operations groups each of which has limited resources some customers may also require us to develop 

  

costly customized features or capabilities which increase our costs and consume a disproportionate share of our limited customer service and support resources also we typically charge onetime flat rate fees for initially connecting a customer to our ss7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the connection is established if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our engineering service support we may experience reduced operating margins our customers’ ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and integrate them successfully within their systems depends on our customers’ capabilities and the complexity involved difficulty in deploying those services could reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause potential delays in recognizing revenues until the services are implemented 

  

our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our signaling and intelligent network services at desired pricing levels could impact our ability to maintain profitability or positive cash flow 

  

the telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price competition competition and industry consolidation in our telecommunications services could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion in our market share pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in the selling price of our services for example our competitors may provide customers with reduced communications costs for internet access or private network services reducing the overall cost of services and significantly increasing pricing pressures on us we would need to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of our customers generating higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs and we may not be able to do so successfully we believe that the business of providing network connectivity and related network services will see increased consolidation in the future consolidation could decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries which could erode our market share revenues and operating margins in our telecommunication services group 

  

our business depends on the future growth of the internet and adoption and continued use of ip networks 

  

our future success substantially depends on growth in the use of the internet and ip networks if the use of and interest in the internet and ip networks does not grow our business would be harmed to date many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the internet and ip networks for a number of reasons including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

the widespread acceptance of the internet and ip networks will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging information organizations that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods also individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting payments may be reluctant to change 

  

we have not been and in the future may not be able to sustain the revenue growth we experienced in the past from our network solutions services which revenue depends in part upon our ability to renew domain name registrations 

  

in 2000 the demand for new domain name registrations in our network solutions web presence business increased substantially in part as a result of our promotional programs in which we accepted domain name registrations at significant discounts or without charge and from registrations by entities who registered domain names with the hopes of reselling them many of those domain names have not been renewed after their twoyear anniversary date further many of the entrepreneurial and startup businesses begun in 2000 and earlier have declined or failed the future success of our network solutions business will depend among other things upon our customers’ renewal of their domain name registrations and upon our ability to obtain new domain name registrations and to successfully market our valueadded product and services to our domain name registrants registrants may choose to renew their domain names with other registrars or they may choose not to renew and pay for renewal of their domain names since we deactivate and delete domain name registrations that are not paid for the inability to obtain domain name registration renewals or new registrations from customers could have an adverse effect on our revenues deferred revenue and our network solutions business 

  

issues arising from implementing agreements with icann and the department of commerce could harm our domain name registration business 

  

the department of commerce or doc has adopted a plan for a phased transition of the doc’s responsibilities for the domain name system to the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers or icann we face risks from this transition including the following 

  

    

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our domain name registration business 

  

risks we face from challenges by third parties including other domestic and foreign governmental authorities to our role in the ongoing privatization of the internet include 

  

   

   

   

   

our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain 

  

our operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside our control these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating expenses may increase if an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from many of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred 

  

  

due to all of the above factors our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions 

  

adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to downturns in the telecommunications and technology industries and may continue to impact our business resulting in 

  

   

   

   

recent political turmoil in many parts of the world including terrorist and military actions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate further we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise we do not expect the trend of lower information technology and telecommunications spending among service providers to reverse itself in the near term 

  

our limited operating history under our current business structure may result in significant fluctuations of our financial results 

  

we were incorporated in april 1995 and began introducing our services in june 1995 in addition we completed several acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 including our acquisitions of network solutions and illuminet holdings and in february 2002 we completed our acquisition of ho systems network solutions illuminet holdings and ho systems operated in different businesses from our then current business therefore we have only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects our success will depend on many factors including but not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

to address these risks we must among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we have sold our products to companies as part of broader business relationships and revenues from these contracts may not be indicative of future revenues 

  

we have purchased products and services from companies and participated in financings of companies with whom we have entered into separate contractual arrangements for the distribution and sale of our products and services we derived approximately 11 of our total revenues in 2002 approximately 38 of our total revenues in 2001 and no revenues in 2000 from reciprocal arrangements typically in these relationships under separate agreements we sell our products and services to a company and that company sells to us their products and services we also derived approximately 22 of our total revenues in 2002 approximately 65 of our total revenues in 2001 and approximately 28 of our revenues in 2000 from customers with whom we have participated in a private equity round of financing including several of the verisign affiliates as well as various technology companies in a variety of related market areas we may not be able to sustain the revenue growth we have experienced in recent periods if we do not continue to participate in business relationships of this nature in addition past revenue growth may not be indicative of future operating results 

  

we may face difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with acquisitions 

  

we made several acquisitions in 2002 2001 and 2000 and may pursue acquisitions in the future we could experience difficulty in integrating the personnel products technologies or operations of companies we acquire assimilating acquired businesses involves a number of other risks including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future acquisitions our business could be harmed 

  

additionally there is risk that we may incur additional expenses associated with a writeoff of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets as was the case when we recorded a charge of approximately 46 billion in the second quarter of 2002 and 99 billion in the second quarter of 2001 related to writedowns of goodwill due to changes in market conditions for acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and to evaluate other intangible assets as events or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired these evaluations could result in further writedowns of goodwill or other intangible assets 

  

our failure to manage past and future growth in our business could harm our business 

  

between december 31 1995 and december 31 2002 we grew from 26 to almost 3200 employees this was achieved through internal growth as well as acquisitions during this time period we opened new sales offices and significantly expanded our us and nonus operations to successfully manage past growth and any future growth we will need to continue to implement additional management information systems continue the development of our operating administrative financial and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our executive engineering accounting finance marketing sales and operations organizations any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business 

  

some of our investments in other companies have resulted in losses and may result in losses in the future 

  

we have investments in a number of companies in most instances these investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market these companies are typically in the early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses therefore these companies may never become publicly traded even if they do an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments further if these companies are not successful we could incur charges related to writedowns or writeoffs of these types of assets during 2002 we recorded losses due to investment writedowns of 1709 million and as of december 31 2002 we held investments totaling 1584 million which included both publicly and nonpublicly traded securities during 2001 we determined that the decline in value of some of our public and private equity security investments was otherthantemporary and recognized a loss of 891 million related to the decline in value of these investments due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments and in light of current stock market conditions we may incur future losses on the sales writedowns or writeoffs of our investments 

  

our industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

  

security services  we anticipate that the market for services that enable trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over ip networks will remain intensely competitive we compete with larger and 

  

smaller companies that provide products and services that are similar to some aspects of our security services our competitors may develop new technologies in the future that are perceived as being more secure effective or cost efficient than the technology underlying our security services we expect that competition will increase in the near term and that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market 

  

increased competition could result in pricing pressures reduced margins or the failure of our security services to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources as a result we may not be able to compete effectively 

  

telecommunications services  we face competition from large wellfunded regional providers of ss7 network services and related products such as regional bell operating companies tsi and southern new england telephone a unit of sbc communication the prepaid wireless account management and unregistered user services of national telemanagement corporation a subsidiary of ours faces competition from boston communications group amdocs convergys corporation and tsi we are also aware of major internet service providers software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete directly with ours 

  

registry services and network solutions  seven new generic toplevel domain registries aero biz coop info museum name and pro  recently began or soon are expected to begin accepting domain name registrations since we do not act as a registry for these new toplevel domains we do not receive the annual registry fee for domain name registrations under these toplevel domains the commencement of registrations in these new toplevel domains could have the effect of reduced demand for com and net domain name registrations if the new toplevel domains reduce the demand for domain name registrations in com and net  our business could be materially harmed 

  

the domain name registration service market is extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure we currently face competition among registrars within the gtlds like  com net and org and in the future will face competition among registrars within all new toplevel domains our competitors include bulkregistercom deutsche telekom france telecomtranspac godaddy software melbourne it registercom and tucowscom inc that register secondlevel domain names in com  net org and the other gtlds we also face competition from thirdlevel domain name providers such as internet access providers and registrars of cctlds we face substantial competition from other providers of valueadded web presence services such as email providers web site designers internet service providers web site hosting companies and others if network solutions is not able to compete effectively our registrar business could be materially harmed 

  

the agreements among icann the doc us and other registrars permit flexibility in pricing for and term of registrations our revenues therefore could be reduced due to pricing pressures bundled service offerings and variable terms from our competitors some registrars and resellers in the com and net toplevel domains charge lower prices for registration services in those domains in addition other entities are bundling and may in the future bundle domain name registrations with other products or services at reduced rates or for free 

  

our industry markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if our products are not widely accepted in these markets our business could suffer 

  

we target our security services at the market for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications over ip networks this is a rapidly evolving market that may not continue to grow 

  

accordingly the demand for our security services is very uncertain even if the market for electronic commerce and communications over ip networks grows our security services may not be widely accepted the 

  

factors that may affect the level of market acceptance of digital certificates and consequently our security services include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

if the market for electronic commerce and communications over ip networks does not grow or our security services are not widely accepted in market our business would be materially harmed 

  

our inability to introduce and implement technological changes in our industry could harm our business 

  

the emerging nature of the internet digital certificate business the domain name registration business and payment services business and their rapid evolution require us continually to improve the performance features and reliability of our services particularly in response to competitive offerings we must also introduce any new services as quickly as possible the success of new services depends on several factors including proper new service definition and timely completion introduction and market acceptance we may not succeed in developing and marketing new services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs this could harm our business 

  

the telecommunications network services industry is also characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements significant technological changes could make our technology obsolete we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the responsiveness reliability and features of our network and by developing new network features services and applications to meet changing customer needs we cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a costeffective way to adequately meet them our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share we sell our ss7 network services primarily to traditional telecommunications companies that rely on traditional voice networks many emerging companies are providing convergent internet protocolbased network services our future revenues and profits if any could depend upon our ability to provide products and services to these internet protocolbased telephony providers 

  

if we encounter system interruptions we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various domain name registration systems secure data centers and other computer and communication networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

  

   

   

   

   

most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is stored in our facilities in mountain view california and kawasaki japan both of which are susceptible to earthquakes dulles and leesburg virginia lacey washington and overland park kansas though we have backup power resources our california locations are susceptible to electric power shortages similar to those experienced during 2001 

  

all of our domain name registration services systems including those used in our domain name registry and registrar business are located at our dulles and leesburg virginia facilities any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our business 

  

in addition our ability to issue digital certificates and register domain names depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and our various registration systems as well as from customers to our registrar and from our registrar and other registrars to the shared registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of web browsers internet service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past any of these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction which could harm our business 

  

a failure in the operation of our various registration systems our domain name zone servers the domain name root servers or other events could result in the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time the inability of our registrar systems including our back office billing and collections infrastructure and telecommunications systems to meet the demands of a large number of domain name registration requests and corresponding customer emails and telephone calls including speculative otherwise abusive and repetitive email domain name registration and modification requests could result in substantial degradation in our customer support service and our ability to process bill and collect registration requests in a timely manner 

  

if we experience security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registry operations also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system the root zone servers and toplevel domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure 

  

despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our security services such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

  

capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use 

  

as traffic from our telecommunication customers through our network increases we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software we may not be able to accurately project the 

  

rate of increase in usage on our network in addition we may not be able to expand and upgrade in a timely manner our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network if we do not appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software we may lose customers and revenues 

  

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively 

  

we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees our success will also depend on our ability to attract integrate train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad in addition our stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel which consist of background checks into prospective employees’ criminal and financial histories further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions 

  

we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving verisign at any time in addition we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 

  

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route internet communications 

  

we currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a volunteer basis because of the importance to the functioning of the internet of these root zone servers our registry services business could be harmed if these volunteer operators fail to maintain these servers properly or abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two root zone servers we operate 

  

further our registry services business could be harmed if any of these volunteer operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the data that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and to the extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server system as provided in our registry agreement with icann it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the toplevel domain zone servers designated by us if icann does not do this our business could be harmed 

  

our web presence services and registry services businesses also could be harmed if a significant number of internet service providers decided not to route internet communications to or from domain names registered by us or if a significant number of internet service providers decided to provide routing to a set of domain name servers that did not point to our domain name zone servers 

  

our signaling and network services reliance on thirdparty communications infrastructure hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control 

  

our signaling and network services success will depend on our network infrastructure including the capacity leased from telecommunications suppliers in particular we rely on att worldcom sprint and other telecommunications providers for leased longhaul and local loop transmission capacity these companies provide the dedicated links that connect our network components to each other and to our customers our business also depends upon the capacity reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that is used to connect telephone calls specifically we currently lease capacity from regional partners on seven of the fourteen mated pairs of ss7 signal transfer points that comprise our network we have no control over the operation quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future our operations could be severely interrupted in addition rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies these mergers may cause the 

  

availability pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services that we use to increase significantly we rely on links equipment and software provided to us from our vendors the most important of which are gateway equipment and software from tekelec and agilent technologies inc we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these vendors on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure product availability with these vendors we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers of products and services 

  

we must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships 

  

one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts we may need to enter into additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of our security services telecommunications services and network solutions services than we would otherwise 

  

our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships particularly in the use and promotion of ip networks for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications and on the ability of these parties to market our internet services group services successfully 

  

furthermore our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple distribution channels particularly with respect to our network solutions business to do this we must maintain relationships with internet access providers and other third parties failure of one or more of our strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our domain name registration and valueadded services could harm our business many of our existing relationships do not and any future relationships may not afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights in addition the other parties may not view their relationships with us as significant for their own businesses therefore they could reduce their commitment to us at any time in the future these parties could also pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products and services either on their own or in collaboration with others including our competitors if we are unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships this could harm our business 

  

some of our services have lengthy sales and implementation cycles 

  

we market many of our internet services group services directly to large companies and government agencies the sale and implementation of our services to these entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources this process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers’ internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital expenditures deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations as a result the sales and implementation cycles associated with certain of our internet services group services can be lengthy potentially lasting from three to six months our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized 

  

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and future operating results 

  

services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services which could result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources injury 

  

to our reputation tort or warranty claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business furthermore we often provide implementation customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs 

  

services offered by our internet services group rely on public key cryptography technology that may compromise our system’s security 

  

services offered by our internet services group depend on public key cryptography technology with public key cryptography technology a user is given a public key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user’s private key and that it is not lost stolen or otherwise compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific mathematical principles known as “factoring” this integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number components is difficult should an easy factoring method be developed the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing pki services obsolete or unmarketable if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business in the past there have been public announcements of the successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this negative public perception could harm our business 

  

the expansion of our international operations subjects our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates accounted for approximately 9 of our revenues in 2002 13 in 2001 and 14 in 2000 we intend to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities for example in addition to our past acquisitions of thawte with operations in south africa and network solutions with operations in asia and europe we have continued to focus on expanding our operations and marketing activities throughout asia europe and latin america expansion into these markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may also need to tailor our services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into international markets failure to do so could harm our business in addition there are risks inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure of verisign affiliates to follow our security and trust practices or to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

we have licensed to verisign affiliates our processing center platform which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the affiliate to offer backend processing of pki services for enterprises the verisign processing center platform provides a verisign affiliate with the knowledge and technology to offer pki services similar to those offered by us it is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the verisign affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and customer service and support these practices are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control 

  

any failure of a verisign affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect the market’s perception of the security of our services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over ip networks generally 

  

we cannot assure you that the european union directive on electronic signatures will stimulate acceptance of our security services or will not be amended in ways which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and business 

  

in july 2001 we enhanced our managed public key infrastructure services processes in order to satisfy the european union directive on electronic signatures which we hope will stimulate the acceptance of digital signatures in europe we cannot guarantee that our enhancements to the services will be accepted by or introduced and marketed successfully in the european markets nor can we guarantee that member nations of the european union will implement the directive in a manner that furthers acceptance of our services in addition we cannot predict whether the european union commission will amend or alter the directive or introduce new legislation nor can we predict the impact such a change in legislation could have on our international business and operations 

  

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business 

  

our success depends on our internally developed technologies and other intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a thirdparty to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or 

  

other forms of our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent us law protects these rights in the united states in addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property our business could suffer in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 

  

we also license thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography technology licensed from rsa and other technology that is used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies a thirdparty could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a thirdparty or between us and a thirdparty could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could delay the introduction of our internet infrastructure services until equivalent technology if available is identified licensed and integrated this could harm our business 

  

our services employ technology that may infringe the proprietary rights of others and we may be liable for significant damages as a result 

  

infringement or other claims could be made against us in the future any claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel cause delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective basis our business could be harmed 

  

in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for example we have had two complaints filed against us in february 2001 and september 2001 alleging patent infringement see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and could harm our business 

  

the sarbanesoxley act which was signed into law in july 2002 mandates among other things that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations in addition the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is traded is also considering the adoption of additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations will increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage further our board members 

  

chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business 

  

proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

  

since our inception we have used stock options and other longterm equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages we believe that stock options and other longterm equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use of vesting encourage employees to remain with verisign the financial accounting standards board “fasb” among other agencies and entities is currently considering changes to us gaap that if implemented would require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants this proposal would negatively impact our earnings for example recording a charge for employee stock options under statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation ” would have increased after tax loss by approximately 241 million 264 million and 131 million for fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively in addition new regulations like those proposed by the nasdaq stock market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees either of which could materially harm our business 

  

we have antitakeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 

  

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

verisign has also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult under the rights plan 

  

   

   

verisign’s board of directors may redeem outstanding rights at any time prior to a person becoming an “acquiring person” at a price of 0001 per right prior to such time the terms of the rights may be amended by verisign’s board of directors without the approval of the holders of the rights 

  

  










 item 2 properties 

  

verisign’s principal administrative sales marketing research and development and operations facilities are located in mountain view california herndon and dulles virginia and lacey washington we own our headquarters complex in mountain view california this complex includes five buildings with a combined area of approximately 395000 square feet we also own our telecommunication services headquarters facility in lacey washington the remainder of our significant facilities are leased under agreements that expire at various dates through 2014 

  

verisign also leases other space for sales and support and training offices in various locations throughout the united states internationally we lease space in a number of different locations including tokyo japan kawasaki japan durbanville south africa sunderland united kingdom geneva switzerland woluwest pierre belgium oslo norway buenos aires argentina sao paulo brazil and malmo sweden the significant sites are listed below including approximate square footage 

  

our success is largely dependent on the uninterrupted operation of our secure data centers and computer and communications systems see item 1 “business—factors that may affect future results of operations” if we encounter system interruptions or security breaches we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

  

   

we believe that our current facilities are sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future 

  

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

as of march 7 2003 verisign and its subsidiary network solutions inc were defendants in approximately 14 active lawsuits involving customer contractual disputes over domain name registrations and related services these matters either alone or collectively are not expected to have a material impact on our domain name registration business or our financial statements

on july 31 2002 the company received a civil investigative demand cid from the us federal trade commission ftc for information to determine whether or not the company’s domain name registration business may have violated section 5 of the ftc act the cid requests information on the company’s registrar’s relationship with interland inc the registrar’s direct mail offer which began in april 2002 the registrar’s transfer practices and the deletion of domain names 

  

we are involved in various other investigations claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business none of which in our opinion will harm our business we cannot assure that we will prevail in any litigation regardless of the outcome any litigation may require us to incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management attention

the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views the fact that we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not necessarily mean that we will do so in the future 

  

in the past securities class action lawsuits have often followed periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

  

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock or other securities and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain our earnings if any for future growth

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts investments and longlived assets management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we derive revenues from three primary categories of services i security services which include managed security and network services web trust services and payment services and registry services 

  

ii telecommunications services which include connectivity intelligent networks wireless and clearinghouse services and iii domain name registration services the revenue recognition policy for each of these categories is as follows 

  

domain name registration services 

  

domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services revenues from the initial registration or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term generally one to two years and up to ten years 

  

domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on renewal and collection rates customers are notified of the expiration of their registration in advance and we record the receivables for estimated renewal fees in the month preceding the anniversary date of their registration when we have a right to bill under the terms of our domain name registration agreements the variance between the actual collections and the rate used to estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the setting of renewal rates for prospective periods fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences these fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term ranging from one to ten years 

  

security services and registry services 

  

revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including postcontract customer support or pcs training and other services these licenses which do not provide for right of return are primarily perpetual licenses for which revenues are recognized upfront once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

  

revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate generally 12 months revenues from the sale of managed pki services are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license generally 12 to 36 months pcs is bundled with managed pki services licenses and recognized over the license term 

  

we recognize revenues from issuances of digital certificates and business process licensing to verisign affiliates in accordance with sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 and generally recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectibility is probable we define each of these four criteria as follows 

  

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a written contract which is signed by both the customer and us or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 

  

delivery has occurred our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer electronic delivery is deemed to have occurred upon download by the customer from an ftp server if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 

  

the fee is fixed or determinable it is our policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of its license fees paid we may agree to payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs generally at least 80 of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable 

  

collectibility is probable collectibility is assessed on a customerbycustomer basis we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection new customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customer’s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 

  

  

if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process revenues are recognized as cash is collected 

  

we allocate revenues on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair value of each element our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to pcs professional services and training components of our perpetual license arrangements we sell our professional services and training separately and have established vsoe on this basis vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer’s annual renewal rates for these elements accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop 989 

  

our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services which are generally billed on a timeandmaterials or milestoneachieved basis 

  

revenues from consulting services are recognized using either the percentageofcompletion method or on a timeandmaterials basis as work is performed percentageofcompletion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed revenues from training are recognized as training is performed 

  

revenues from thirdparty product sales are recognized when title to the products sold passes to the customer our shipping terms generally dictate that the passage of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the customer 

  

revenues from payment services primarily consist of a setup fee and a monthly service fee for the transaction processing services in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” revenues from setup fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned revenues from the service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided 

  

telecommunications services 

  

revenues from telecommunications services are comprised of network connectivity revenues and intelligent network services revenues and wireless billing and customer care services network connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to our ss7 network and trunk signaling services revenues from network connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees and trunk signaling service revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a customer signals the initial connection fee and related costs are deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement intelligent network services which include calling card validation local number portability wireless services tollfree database access and caller identification are derived primarily from database administration and database query services and are charged on a peruse or perquery basis revenues from prepaid wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue retained by us and recognized in the period in which such 

  

calls are processed on a perminute or percall basis revenues from wireless billing and customer care services primarily represent a monthly recurring fee for every subscriber activated by our wireless carrier customers 

  

clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a distribution and collection point for billing information and payment collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another clearinghouse revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are amounts from customers that are related to our telecommunications services for thirdparty network access data base charges and clearinghouse toll amounts that have been invoiced and remitted to the customer 

  

reciprocal arrangements 

  

on occasion we have purchased goods or services for our operations from organizations at or about the same time that we licensed our software to these organizations these transactions are recorded at terms we consider to be fair value for these reciprocal arrangements we consider accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” and emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0102 “interpretation of apb opinion no 29” to determine whether the arrangement is a monetary or nonmonetary transaction transactions involving the exchange of boot representing 25 or greater of the fair value of the reciprocal arrangement are considered monetary transactions within the context of apb opinion no 29 and eitf issue no 0102 monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions that represent the culmination of an earnings process are recorded at the fair value of the products delivered or products or services received whichever is more readily determinable provided that fair values are determinable within reasonable limits in determining fair value we consider the recent history of cash sales of the same products or services in similar sized transactions revenues from such transactions may be recognized over a period of time as the products or services are received for nonmonetary reciprocal arrangements that do not represent the culmination of the earnings process the exchange is recorded based on the carrying value of the products delivered which is generally zero 

  

in 2002 we recognized revenues under reciprocal arrangements of approximately 140 million of which 97 million involved nonmonetary transactions as defined above in 2001 we recognized revenues under reciprocal arrangements of approximately 375 million of which 270 million involved nonmonetary transactions as defined above we did not recognize any revenues under reciprocal arrangements in 2000 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance each customer’s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above in addition we maintain a general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer industry or geographic region to date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that if not collected would have a significant impact on our operating income we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 

  

investments 

  

we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for business and strategic purposes some of these companies are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices however in most instances these investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial 

  

losses in the nearterm therefore these companies may never become publicly traded even if they do an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments further if these companies are not successful we could incur charges related to writedowns or writeoffs of these investments 

  

we review our marketable equity holdings in publicly traded companies on a regular basis to determine if any security has experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value we consider the investee company’s cash position earnings and revenue outlook stock price performance over the preceding six months liquidity and changes in management’s ownership among other factors in our review if we determine that an otherthan temporary decline exists in a marketable equity security that is classified as availableforsale we record an investment loss in our consolidated statement of operations for nonpublic companies we review on a quarterly basis the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information requested from these privately held companies on at least a quarterly basis this information may be more limited may not be as timely and may be less accurate than information available from publicly traded companies assessing each investment’s carrying value requires significant judgment by management generally if cash balances are insufficient to sustain a company’s operations for a sixmonth period we consider the decline in it’s fair value to be otherthantemporary if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists in a nonpublic equity security we writedown the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

during 2002 and 2001 we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and recorded writedowns of these investments totaling 1709 million and 891 million respectively during 2000 we recorded no investment writedowns 

  

valuation of longlived intangible assets including goodwill 

  

our longlived assets consist primarily of goodwill other intangible assets and property and equipment we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable such events or circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 11 billion as of december 31 2002 which was comprised of 6673 million of goodwill including workforce in place and 4623 million of other intangibles assets other intangible assets include isp hosting relationships customer relationships technology in place noncompete agreements trade names and contracts with icann and customer lists factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements based on these measurements we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 46 billion during 2002 

  

recoverability of longlived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

  

we review at least annually goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we review longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” 

  

results of operations 

  

we have experienced substantial net losses in the past due primarily to the charges we have incurred for the amortization and writedown of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions as of december 31 2002 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 215 billion primarily due to the amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately 217 billion related to our acquisitions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill is no longer amortized to earnings as of january 1 2002 amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately 189 million in 2003 including the impact of all acquisitions through december 31 2002 and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges 

  

we accounted for all of our acquisitions in 2002 2001 and 2000 as purchase business combinations accordingly the acquired companies’ revenues costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition as a result of our acquisitions of ho systems in february 2002 illuminet holdings in december 2001 network solutions in june 2000 and thawte and signio in february 2000 comparisons of revenues costs and expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 to the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 may not be relevant as the businesses represented in the consolidated financial statements were not equivalent 

  

revenues 

  

beginning in the first quarter of 2003 verisign realigned its business segments the new servicebased business segments consist of the internet services group the telecommunication services group and network solutions the management’s discussion and analysis that follows is based on our previous structure that was in effect throughout 2002 2001 and 2000 for more information on both our previous structure and our new servicebased business segments please refer to note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

a comparison of revenues for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 is presented below 

  

   

total revenues increased 24 in 2002 compared to 2001 consisting of an increase in enterprise and service provider division revenues of 89 partially offset by a decrease in mass markets division revenues of 26 the increase in revenues for our enterprise and service provider division was primarily due to our telecommunications services acquisitions of illuminet holdings in december 2001 and ho systems in february 2002 additionally we experienced a modest increase in our registry services revenues revenues for our mass markets division which included revenues from our web presence and trust services businesses decreased 26 primarily due to a decline in the amount of deferred revenue recognized in 2002 from prior year 

  

sales compared with the amount of such deferred revenue from prior year sales recognized in 2001 revenue a decrease in the number of new names and the nonrenewal of names paid for contributed to this decline in deferred revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 there were fewer domain names under management by network solutions at december 31 2002 as compared to december 31 2001 mainly due to the deletion of names that had never been paid for or the term of which had expired in years prior to 2002 but which had not been deleted in those prior years many of these were nonrevenue generating names 

  

revenues increased significantly in 2001 from 2000 for our enterprise and service provider division and our mass markets division the increases were primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 whose registry services revenues and web presence revenues are attributable to our enterprise and service provider division and our mass markets division respectively sales of authentication services particularly web site digital certificates and enterprise and affiliate pki services also increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 in addition we expanded the verisign trust network of worldwide affiliates in 2001 and saw increased demand for our training and consulting services during 2001 as compared to 2000 

  

we derived 22 in 2002 65 in 2001 and 28 in 2000 of our total revenues from customers with whom we have participated in a private equity round of financing including several of the verisign affiliates as well as various technology companies in a variety of related market areas typically in these relationships we sell our products and services to a company and under a separate agreement participate with other investors in a private equity round financing of the company we typically make our investments with others where our investment is less than 50 of the total financing round our policy is not to recognize revenue in excess of other investors’ financing of the company these arrangements are independent relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are violated 

  

in 2002 and 2001 we derived 11 and 38 of our total revenues from reciprocal arrangements respectively we derived no revenues from customers from reciprocal arrangements in 2000 typically in these relationships under separate agreements we sell our products and services to a company and that company sells to us their products and services we enter into these arrangements for strategic business purposes and the goods and services we receive in exchange are those we would have purchased in nonreciprocal arrangements these arrangements are independent relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are violated 

  

enterprise and service provider division 

  

enterprise and service provider division revenues from external customers were 8096 million in 2002 4285 million in 2001 and 1921 million in 2000 in 2002 revenues from our managed security and network services product line decreased approximately 104 million to 2876 million from 2980 million in 2001 the decrease in revenues was related to a decrease in international affiliate revenues partially offset by an increase in revenues related to prior year acquisitions and from an increase in consulting services revenues which included the resale of thirdparty products we expect revenues from our managed security and networks services which will be included in our internet services group in future periods to decrease in 2003 due to our recent decision to significantly reduce the resale of thirdparty products thirdparty software and hardware sales are generally made at lower margins than our other enterprise and mass market sales 

  

in 2001 revenues from the managed security and network services product line increased approximately 1500 million to 2980 million from 1480 million in 2000 the revenue increase was primarily due to increases in managed pki services sold software licenses sold to 13 new affiliate service providers an increase in royalties earned from existing affiliates and an overall increase in the volume of consulting services that included the resale of thirdparty products 

  

  

in 2002 revenues from registry and telecommunications services increased approximately 3914 million to 5219 million from 1305 million in 2001 this increase reflects the inclusion of a full year of telecommunications services revenues in 2002 relating to our acquisition of illuminet holdings in december 2001 and over ten months of revenues relating to our acquisition of ho systems in february 2002 the acquisition of illuminet holdings and ho systems resulted in a net increase in telecommunications services revenues of approximately 3741 million in 2002 in addition revenues from our registry services increased modestly our registry services business unit processed the renewal extension or transfer of 105 million domain names during 2002 bringing the total number of paid domain name transactions during 2002 to 251 million an increase of approximately 31 million over 2001 at december 31 2002 our registry services business managed approximately 283 million domain names 

  

in 2001 revenues from registry and telecommunications services increased approximately 864 million to 1305 million from 441 million in 2000 this increase reflects the inclusion of a full year of registry services revenue compared to approximately seven months in 2000 as a result of the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 revenues related to outsourced managed registry services also increased our registry services business unit managed approximately 288 million domain names at december 31 2001 for all domain names ending in com net and org  our registry services business unit also processed the renewal extension or transfer of 89 million domain names during 2001 bringing the total number of paid domain name transactions during 2001 to 220 million 

  

mass markets division 

  

mass markets division revenues were 4121 million in 2002 5551 million in 2001 and 2826 million in 2000 in 2002 the decrease in revenues of 1430 million was primarily due to the decrease in the amount of deferred revenue recognized in 2002 from prior year sales compared to the amount of such deferred revenue from prior year sales recognized in 2001 revenue a decrease in the number of new names and the nonrenewal of names paid for contributed to this decline in deferred revenue this decline in revenue was also partially offset by an increase in revenues from the sales of web site digital certificates and revenues related to payment services at december 31 2002 network solutions had a total of approximately 93 million domain names under management compared to approximately 136 million domain names at december 31 2001 

  

in 2001 the increase in revenues in the mass markets division was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from web presence services compared to approximately seven months in 2000 as a result of the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 

  

in 2000 the demand for new domain name registrations in our web presence business increased substantially as a result of but not limited to the socalled “internet bubble” our promotional programs which included free names and from registrations by entities who registered domain names with the hopes of reselling them most of the unpaid for promotional and speculative names were not renewed and have been deleted from the registry zone file in 2002 many of these were not revenue generating names or products in 2002 

  

our mass markets division and our enterprise and service provider division issued approximately 391000 new and renewed web site digital certificates in 2002 compared to 366000 in 2001 and 274000 in 2000 the total installed base of web site digital certificates was over 392000 at december 31 2002 compared to 366000 at december 31 2001 in addition due to increased competition in the web trust services market we have experienced moderate pricing pressure for our services we expect that this pricing pressure will continue in 2003 

  

  

international revenues 

  

revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates accounted for 9 of total revenues in 2002 13 in 2001 and 14 in 2000 the percentage decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the acquisitions of illuminet holdings in december 2001 and ho systems in february 2002 whose revenues are derived principally from customers located in the united states additionally a decline in the number of new licensing agreements and royalty payments received from verisign affiliates has resulted in a decrease in international revenues in 2002 of approximately 43 million partially offset by increases in revenues from international subsidiaries of approximately 20 million in 2003 verisign is transitioning its international strategy in some countries by moving from a distribution model through the verisign affiliates to a direct distribution model through its international subsidiaries as a result in 2003 we expect international revenues to increase modestly even though revenues from verisign affiliates will likely decline 

  

the percentage decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily related to the acquisition in june 2000 of network solutions whose revenues are primarily attributable to us sources this was partially offset by additional revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in 2001 related to an increase in the number of verisign affiliates in the verisign trust network combined with other activities to expand our presence in foreign markets 

  

under our international affiliate program we sign agreements with local telecommunications companies financial institutions and others to promote sell and distribute our pki services in international markets around the world these verisign affiliates typically require significant capital development the cost of which is borne by the affiliate our strategy from time to time also includes investing in certain affiliates in strategic markets that represent advantageous economic opportunities for a minority investment of less than 20 as a result we invested in several international affiliates in 2002 and prior years revenues from verisign affiliates in which we have a minority investment of less than 20 accounted for 15 of total revenues in 2002 45 in 2001 and 15 in 2000 

  

costs and expenses 

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services payment services operational costs for the domain name registration business customer support and training consulting and development services carrier costs for our ss7 and ipbased networks and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities in addition with respect to our digital certificate services cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify certificate applicants’ identities insurance premiums for our service warranty plan errors and omission insurance and the cost of software and hardware resold to customers 

  

a comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 is presented below 

  

   

growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of revenues on an absolute dollar basis in 2002 as compared to 2001 and in 2001 as compared to 2000 we acquired illuminet holdings in december 2001 and ho systems in february 2002 which added significant cost of revenues during 2002 we incurred increased expenses for access to thirdparty databases to verify digital certificate applicants’ identities increased customer service costs related to our larger customer base and increased expenses related to the cost of hardware and software products resold to customers as part of our consulting business registry fees thirdparty fees other direct costs and labor are our largest expense categories for cost of revenues the acquisition of illuminet holdings resulted in an increase in labor expenses of 354 million in 2002 and an increase of 1245 million for thirdparty fees and other direct costs additionally depreciation expenses in cost of revenues increased due to the illuminet acquisition by 313 million in 2002 compared to 2001 while overall our cost of revenues 

  

increased we reduced outside consulting costs by 104 million in 2002 from 2001 due to a companywide cost reduction effort our acquisition of network solutions in june of 2000 increased our cost of revenues in 2001 as compared to 2000 due to the inclusion of a full year of operating activity in 2001 compared to less than seven months in 2000 future acquisitions further expansion into international markets and introduction of new products may result in additional increases in cost of revenues due to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses and other factors 

  

cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased significantly during 2002 compared to 2001 due to the inclusion of a full year of activity from our illuminet holdings acquisition and due to over 10 months of activity from our ho systems acquisition our telecommunications services businesses have different cost structures than our other businesses resulting in an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues since their acquisitions cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in 2001 from 2000 primarily due to the cost structure of the network solutions product mix and the increase in the volume of thirdparty hardware and software sales which was partially offset by economies of scale associated with the growth in recurring revenues from existing customers 

  

certain of our services such as consulting and training require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types of services in addition revenues derived from our authentication services domain name registration services registry services payment services and our telecommunications services each have different cost structures and our overall cost of revenues may fluctuate as these businesses mature we anticipate that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will decrease modestly in 2003 due to our recent decision to significantly reduce the resale of thirdparty products 

  

sales and marketing 

  

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing and policy activities these expenses include salaries sales commissions sales operations and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees and costs of marketing programs such as internet television radio print and direct mail advertising costs 

  

a comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 is presented below 

  

   

sales and marketing expenses decreased on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to a substantial reduction in expenditures for advertising and related promotional activities particularly with respect to network solutions and from a decrease in allocated lease expenses advertising and related promotional expenditures declined by over 447 million due to a heightened effort to control spending in conjunction with our restructuring program announced in april 2002 in an effort to decrease the use of external vendors for sales and marketing efforts we have increased our internal labor expenses during 2002 this increase partially offsets the savings noted above the decrease in allocated lease expenses is a result of our purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view california in october of 2001 on an absolute dollar basis our acquisitions of illuminet holdings and ho systems in december 2001 and february 2002 respectively partially offset the decrease in spending for advertising and related promotional activities and allocated lease expenses during 2002 these acquisitions resulted in an additional 121 million of sales and marketing labor expenses for 2002 as compared to 2001 additionally we incurred increased depreciation expense during 2002 compared to 2001 due to the depreciation of our headquarters facility and other property and equipment expenditures during 2002 

  

  

the network solutions acquisition was the primary reason for the increase in sales and marketing expenses on an absolute dollar basis in 2001 as compared to 2000 the mass markets division incurred expenses promoting the value of the com net and org  web addresses as well as valueadded services including web site design tools and other enhanced service offerings the remainder of the increase in both periods was driven by lead and demand generation activities in our enterprise and affiliate pki businesses expansion of our sales force and an increase in international sales expenses on a percentage of revenues basis the acquisition of network solutions whose sales and marketing costs were comparatively less per revenue dollar than our other existing businesses combined was the primary reason for the decrease in 2001 from 2000 

  

we have continued to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues over the threeyear period presented this is primarily due to the increase in recurring revenues from existing customers which tend to have lower retention costs and the increase in the productivity of our direct and inside sales forces however we cannot forecast that these sales and marketing expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues and we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase modestly on an absolute dollar basis in the future due to our expectations to increase our direct sales force abroad and to expand our other distribution channels 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel including salaries and other personnelrelated expenses consulting fees and the costs of facilities computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development 

  

a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 is presented below 

  

   

research and development expenses decreased in 2002 from 2001 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues the absolute dollar decrease is related to a substantial decrease in allocated lease expenses resulting from our purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view california in october 2001 and from benefits realized as a result of our restructuring program additionally during 2001 we incurred overall higher expenses for the design testing and deployment of our security service offerings as compared to 2002 

  

research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in 2001 from 2000 primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 the increase relates to the development and enhancement of new registry products related to multilingual domain names and managed domain name system services in addition we continued to invest in the design testing and deployment of and technical support for our expanded digital trust service offerings and technology we also expanded our engineering staff and incurred related costs required to support our continued emphasis on developing new products and services as well as enhancing existing products and services 

  

the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2001 from 2000 is largely due to the fact that revenues increased faster than research and development expenses in these periods 

  

we believe that timely development of new and enhanced enterprise services payment services web presence services and other technologies are necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development as a result we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in absolute dollars and on a percentage of revenues basis in the future to date we have expensed all research and development expenditures as incurred 

  

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance and human resources personnel facilities and computer and communications equipment management information systems support services professional services fees and bad debt expense 

  

a comparison of general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 is presented below 

  

   

general and administrative expenses increased in 2002 from 2001 on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to our acquisitions of illuminet holdings and ho systems in december 2001 and february 2002 respectively these acquisitions resulted in a net increase in general and administrative expenses of 233 million during 2002 of which 90 million was labor expenses in addition bad debt expense increased to 427 million in 2002 compared to 269 million in 2001 primarily as a result of the continued deterioration in the overall economy legal expense increased by 32 million for 2002 and insurance costs increased 19 million primarily due to an increase in renewal premium rates in 2002 as compared to 2001 depreciation expense increased modestly during 2002 resulting from the depreciation of our headquarters facility and other property and equipment expenditures during 2002 increases in our general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreases in lease expenses resulting from the purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view california in october 2001 and the benefits realized from our restructuring program announced in april 2002 these benefits included reduction in general and administrative outside consulting expenses of 134 million and travel expenses of 21 million for 2002 the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is due to the fact that consolidated revenues increased at a faster rate than general and administrative expenses over the same periods as a result of our acquisitions of illuminet holdings and ho systems 

  

the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2001 over 2000 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues was primarily related to the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 expenses increased in 2001 from 2000 due to additional staffing levels required to manage and support our expanded operations the implementation of additional management information systems and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in addition our bad debt expense increased to 269 million in 2001 from 58 million in 2000 primarily as a result of increased revenues and deterioration in the overall economy during 2001 

  

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease on an absolute dollar basis in 2003 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

in april 2002 we announced plans to restructure our operations to rationalize integrate and align our resources our restructuring program included workforce reductions abandonment of excess facilities writeoff of abandoned property and equipment and other charges as a result of our restructuring program and in conformity with sab no 100 and eitf issues no 943 and 8810 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 886 million during 2002 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 10 to 15 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to the restructuring of our consulting services our restructuring program is part of a largerscale ongoing effort to reduce companywide spending cost savings resulting from our restructuring program not including other cost savings efforts were estimated to have been approximately 52 million in 2002 and are estimated to be approximately 56 million in 2003 

  

  

workforce reduction the restructuring program resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees across certain business functions operating units and geographic regions we recorded a workforce reduction charge of 62 million during 2002 relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 

  

excess facilities we recorded charges of approximately 297 million during 2002 for excess facilities that were either abandoned or downsized relating to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs to determine the lease loss which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing an abandoned building or separable portion thereof certain estimates were made related to the 1 time period over which the relevant space would remain vacant 2 sublease terms and 3 sublease rates including common area charges if market sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional 36 million property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned resulted in a net charge of 250 million during 2002 and consisted primarily of computer software leasehold improvements and computer equipment 

  

exit costs and other charges we recorded other exit costs consisting of the writeoff of prepaid license fees associated with products that were intended to be incorporated into our product offerings but were subsequently abandoned as a result of the decision to restructure these charges totaled approximately 91 million during 2002 as part of our efforts to rationalize integrate and align resources we also recorded other charges of 186 million during 2002 relating primarily to the writeoff of prepaid marketing assets associated with discontinued advertising 

  

a summary of the restructuring and other charges recorded during 2002 are as follows 

  

   

at december 31 2002 the accrued liability associated with the restructuring and other charges was 238 million and consisted of the following 

  

   

writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development 

  

the portion of the network solutions purchase price allocated to inprocess research and development or iprd was 54 million and was expensed immediately upon acquisition in 2000 network solutions’ iprd efforts focused on significant and substantial improvements and upgrades to its shared registration system or srs the srs is the system that provides a shared registration interface to the icann accredited and licensed 

  

registrars into the com net and org toplevel domain or tld registry it is through this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain names with the central database given the high demand on the srs it was in need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability security nonenglish language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol 

  

as of the acquisition date network solutions was in the process of developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to the srs the iprd had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses the technological feasibility of the inprocess development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all planning designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications including functions features and technical performance requirements the development efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the srs and other systems were completed in the first quarter of 2001 

  

amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

during 2002 we completed our acquisition of ho systems which resulted in the recording of goodwill of approximately 213 million and other intangible assets of approximately 210 million during 2001 we completed our acquisition of illuminet holdings along with a number of other less significant acquisitions which resulted in the recording of goodwill of approximately 13 billion and other intangible assets of approximately 281 million during 2000 we completed several acquisitions including thawte signio and network solutions these acquisitions resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets in the amount of 213 billion we adopted sfas no 142 as of january 1 2002 under the provisions of sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles are no longer amortized but are subject to testing for impairment on at least an annual basis verisign also adopted sfas no 144 as of january 1 2002 under the provisions of sfas no 144 longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset the results of this testing indicated the carrying values of goodwill for certain reporting units exceeded their implied fair values and other intangible assets with finite lives had carrying values that exceeded their fair values which resulted in an impairment charge of 46 billion in 2002 

  

verisign determines the fair value of its reporting units in part by engaging independent appraisers who employ the income approach and the market comparables method of valuation determining the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets requires significant judgment with respect to projecting future cash flows selecting appropriate terminal values and discount rates additionally judgment is required in selecting appropriate market comparable companies in the valuations 

  

the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002 resulted in a writeoff of the net book value as follows 

  

   

prior to our adoption of sfas no 142 on january 1 2002 our policy was to assess the recoverability of goodwill using estimated undiscounted cash flows those cash flows included an estimated terminal value based 

  

on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of its goodwill amortization period although the acquisitions of thawte signio and network solutions had been predominantly performing at or above expectations throughout 2001 market conditions and attendant multiples used to estimate terminal values were depressed at june 30 2000 the nasdaq market index was at 3966 points and had decreased 1805 points or 46 to 2161 points at june 30 2001 this decline affected the analysis used to assess the recoverability of goodwill for goodwill associated with thawte and network solutions fair value was determined based on future operating cash flows over the remaining amortization period of the goodwill the terminal values were estimated based on the relationship of the value of our stock issued at the acquisition date to the value of our stock over the threemonth period preceding the valuation for signio and the other acquisitions fair value was determined through the use of recent indicators of fair value such as comparable sales and multiples derived from recent acquisition activities as a result we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 99 billion in 2001 since the most significant acquisitions were completed by issuing shares of our common stock the impairment is considered a noncash charge 

  

the amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately 49 billion in 2002 136 billion in 2001 and 32 billion in 2000 excluding impairment writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization expense was approximately 284 million in 2002 37 billion in 2001 and 32 billion in 2000 the decrease in amortization expense excluding writedowns in 2002 from 2001 is due to the effects of the provisions of sfas no 142 in which goodwill is no longer amortized the increase in amortization expense in 2001 from 2000 is due to a full year’s amortization of network solutions in 2001 amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately 189 million for 2003 including the impact of all acquisitions through december 31 2002 and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges 

  

total other income expense 

  

total other income expense consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments gains and losses on the sale or writedown of equity investments and the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 

  

a comparison of total other income expense for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 is presented below 

  

   

total other expense in 2002 was primarily comprised of the writedown of investments totaling 1709 million on certain public and nonpublic equity security investments partially offset by 79 million of net gains realized on the sale of investments and 141 million of interest and other income in 2002 we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and nonpublic equity securities investments was otherthantemporary and we recorded a writedown of these investments totaling 1709 million our cash cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments decreased to 4406 million at december 31 2002 from 9285 million at december 31 2001 primarily due to the acquisition of ho systems purchases of property and equipment and the decline in value and subsequent writedown of investments during 2002 these actions resulted in a decrease in interest income earned during 2002 as compared to 2001 

  

total other expense in 2001 was primarily comprised of the writedown of investments totaling 891 million on certain public and nonpublic equity security investments partially offset by 667 million of interest and other income total other income in 2000 consisted primarily of a realized gain of 326 million from the sale of shares of keynote systems inc and interest and other income of 536 million in 2001 we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and nonpublic equity securities investments was 

  

otherthantemporary and we recorded a writedown of these investments totaling 891 million we had previously valued certain of these investments at the thenfairmarket value as part of the network solutions acquisition we may from time to time recognize losses or gains from the sales writedowns or writeoffs of our equity investments in 2000 our cash and investments base increased significantly as a result of the acquisition of network solutions however our invested balances produced lower returns due to lower market interest rates in 2001 as compared to 2000 

  

income tax benefit expense 

  

in 2002 we recorded income tax expense of 104 million this expense was comprised of federal taxes of 21 million state taxes of 92 million and foreign income tax benefit of 9 million we have not recorded a benefit for us federal and state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization as of december 31 2002 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 188 million related to continuing operations and 6631 million related to stock compensation deductions we also had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 596 million related to continuing operations and 5151 million related to stock compensation deductions if we are not able to use them the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2022 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2004 through 2022 in addition we had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately 80 million available for carryover to future years and for state income tax purposes of approximately 65 million available for carryover to future years the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire if not utilized in 2010 through 2022 state research and experimental tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized the tax reform act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation’s ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership changes 

  

minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary 

  

minority interest in the net income loss of verisign japan kk and verisign australia limited was 4 million in 2002 6 million in 2001 and 13 million in 2000 the yeartoyear changes are primarily due to verisign japan’s increased revenues as compared to the prior years partially offset by losses incurred by verisign australia following our acquisition of a majority interest in the company in july 2002 as the verisign japan and verisign australia businesses continue to develop and evolve we expect that the minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary will fluctuate 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

at december 31 2002 our principal source of liquidity was 4039 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisting principally of commercial paper medium term corporate notes corporate bonds and notes market auction securities us government and agency securities and money market funds 

  

working capital decreased 3178 million over the periods presented due to a decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 3228 million primarily as a result of our acquisition of ho systems in 2002 and due to a decrease in net accounts receivable and other current assets of 1635 million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 551 million and a decrease in current deferred revenue of 1134 million 

  

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 2384 million in 2002 2275 million in 2001 and 1920 million in 2000 the increase in both 2002 and 2001 was primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for noncash items such as amortization and the writedown of goodwill and other intangible assets depreciation of property and equipment and the writedown of certain investments additionally in 2002 a substantial decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrual liabilities contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared to 2001 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 2825 million in 2002 primarily as a result of 3486 million used for acquisitions which includes 3463 million for the acquisition of ho systems along with an additional 536 million used in acquisition related costs during 2002 we also used 1121 million for purchases of short and longterm investments and 1762 million for purchases of property and equipment these purchases were partially offset by proceeds of 4036 million from maturities and sales of short and longterm investments 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 3891 million in 2001 primarily as a result of 13 billion used for purchases of investments which were offset by proceeds of 14 billion from sales and maturities of investments 3803 million used for purchases of property and equipment including approximately 285 million used for the purchase of the land and buildings for our corporate headquarters in california and 526 million paid net of cash acquired for business combinations 

  

net cash provided by investing activities was 1240 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the cash acquired in our acquisitions partially offset by increased purchases of short and longterm investments and costs relating to our acquisitions capital expenditures for property and equipment totaled 1762 million in 2002 3803 million in 2001 and 588 million in 2000 

  

our planned capital expenditures for 2003 are approximately 120 million to 130 million primarily for computer and communications equipment computer software and leasehold improvements our most significant expenditures are focused on market development initiatives as well as productivity and cost improvement as of december 31 2002 we also had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014 see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements we also expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 10 to 15 million in the first quarter of 2003 due to the restructuring of our consulting services in addition cash payments totaling 235 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next six years see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements cost savings resulting from our restructuring program not including other cost savings efforts were estimated to have been approximately 52 million in 2002 and are estimated to be approximately 56 million in 2003 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 220 million in 2002 108 million in 2001 and 735 million in 2000 in 2002 2001 and 2000 cash was provided primarily from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises in 2001 these proceeds were partially offset by the use of approximately 70 million to repurchase shares of our common stock 

  

in 2001 our board of directors authorized the use of up to 350 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades during 2001 we repurchased approximately 1650000 shares at a cost of approximately 70 million during 2002 no shares were repurchased and at december 31 2002 approximately 280 million remained available for future repurchases under this program 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months an increase in the number of significant acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements this additional funding if needed might not be available on terms attractive to us or at all failure to raise capital 

  

when needed could materially harm our business if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities the percentage of our stock owned by our thencurrent stockholders will be reduced furthermore these equity securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 

  

we have entered into various capital lease obligations and we lease a portion of our facilities under operating leases we also sublease a portion of our office space to third parties in addition we have signed a master contract with ibm under which we are committed to purchase a predetermined value of their technology and we have entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the tv cctld with the government of tuvalu for payments of future royalties as of december 31 2002 the present value of our future minimum capital lease payments our future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases our future minimum sublease income our ibm purchase commitments and our future royalty payments for the next five years are as follows 

  

   

we have pledged a portion of our shortterm investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements as of december 31 2002 the amount of shortterm investments we have pledged pursuant to such agreements was approximately 21 million 

  

the restructuring accrual is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms the longest of which extends through february 2008 

  

future cash payments related to lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities are expected to be as follows 

  

   

we entered into an agreement with bank of america effective june 1 2000 to provide a capital expenditure loan facility the capital expenditure loan facility is a 15 million unsecured loan with a fiveyear term as of december 31 2002 720000 was outstanding under this capital expenditure loan facility 

  

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices with a total public offering price not to exceed 750 million to date no shares have been issued under this registration statement 

  

  

in december 2001 we signed a master contract with ibm under which we committed to purchase 30 million of ibm technology on or before december 28 2004 during 2002 we paid ibm 241 million and at december 31 2002 we had an additional 21 million of open purchase orders with ibm under the master contract ibm has also committed to use certain products and services of verisign 

  

in november 1999 we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the tuvalu internet toplevel domain “tv” with the government of tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to 128 million over the next six years 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 eliminates emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” under sfas no 146 liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liabilities are incurred as opposed to being recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan under eitf no 943 furthermore sfas no 146 establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liabilities this statement will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 the effect of adopting sfas no 146 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations the effect on timing of recognition of liabilities could be significantly different from previous restructurings 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation ” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 148 are presented in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the interim disclosure provisions are effective for our march 31 2003 interim period we have determined that the adoption of sfas no 148 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 34 ” this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize at inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements the annual disclosure requirements are effective for these financial statements and for interim periods ending after december 15 2002 see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures required by fasb interpretation no 45 the adoption of fasb interpretation no 45 did not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “ consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin “arb” no 51 ” this interpretation requires companies to include in their consolidated financial statements the assets liabilities and results of activities of variable interest entities if the company holds a majority of the variable interests the consolidated requirements of this interpretation are effective for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 or for entities in which an interest is acquired after january 31 2003 the consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective june 15 2003 for all variable entities acquired before february 1 2003 this interpretation also requires companies that expect to consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired before february 1 2003 to disclose 

  

the entities nature size activities and the company’s maximum exposure to loss in financial statements issued after january 31 2003 we have determined this interpretation will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at december 31 2002 this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper mediumterm notes corporate bonds and notes market auction securities us government and agency securities and money market funds in general money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate in addition we generally invest in relatively shortterm securities as of december 31 2002 70 of our nonstrategic investments mature in less than one year 

  

we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 

  

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2002 this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 

  

   

exchange rate sensitivity 

  

we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal all revenues derived from operations other than verisign japan kk thawte south africa verisign australia limited domainnamescom uk and our european digital brand management services business are denominated in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for approximately 9 of our revenues in 2002 13 in 2001 and 14 in 2000 

  

both the revenues and expenses of our majorityowned subsidiaries in japan and australia as well as our whollyowned subsidiaries and sales offices in south africa europe and the united kingdom are denominated in local currencies in these regions we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the united states dollar will result in lower revenues when translated to united states dollars operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances we have not engaged in any hedging activities although if future events or changes in circumstances indicate that hedging activities would be beneficial we may consider such activities 

  

  

equity price risk 

  

we own shares of common stock of public companies we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month these investments are subject to market price volatility we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” component of stockholders’ equity we have also invested in equity instruments of several privately held companies many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages and therefore carry a high level of risk in 2002 and 2001 we determined the decline in value of certain public and nonpublic equity investments was otherthantemporary and we recognized impairment losses totaling 1709 million and 891 million respectively due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments and in light of current stock market conditions we may incur future losses on the sales writedowns or writeoffs of our investments we do not currently hedge against equity price changes

services local number portability wireless services tollfree number
database access and caller identification in addition through illuminet we
provide clearinghouse services ss7 network reporting services and we license
specially designed software for measuring ss7 network usage brief descriptions
of some of these services are set forth below

   connectivity switching and transport services

    ss7 connectivity switching and transport  these are component parts of
     our basic ss7 trunk signaling service trunk signaling reduces postdial
     delay allowing call connection almost as soon as dialing is completed
     this enables telecommunications carriers to deploy a full range of
     intelligent network services more quickly and cost effectively by using
     our trunksignaling service carriers simplify ss7 link provisioning and
     reach all local interexchange carriers or ixc and wireless carriers
     networks though our access to hundreds of carriers

    database access messaging  we provide the ss7 functions that enable
     carriers to find and interact with network databases and conduct the
     database queries that are essential for many advanced services such as
     call waiting call forwarding and threeway calling

   intelligent network services

    local number portability lnp  in 1996 the federal communications
     commission or fcc mandated that incumbent local exchange carriers
     implement wireline number portability in all major us markets beginning
     in 1999 wireless carriers are required to provide routing information for
     calls completed to ported numbers lnp allows a telephone subscriber to
     switch local service providers while keeping the same telephone number

    line information database lidb access and transport  lidbs are
     developed and maintained by telecommunications carriers to store
     information about their subscribers necessary to provide enhanced services
     such as validating telephone numbers and billing information through our
     ss7 network we offer access to all lidbs in the united states the service
     also includes validating calling cards collect and thirdparty calls as
     well as fraud protection features

    calling name cnam delivery access and transport  we offer cnam
     database access allowing carriers to query regional bell operating
     companies and major independent carriers and reduce name not available
     messages that customers receive when a callers phone number is not
     identifiable when using a carriers caller identification or caller id
     service

   wireless services

    seamless roaming  we provide nationwide seamless roaming support using
     the ansi41 signaling protocol ansi41 allows carriers to provide support
     for roamers visiting their service area and for their customers when they
     roam outside their service area it enables number validation inside and
     outside carriers service areas by accessing our ss7 network

    prepaid wireless services  our smartpay prepaid wireless service is a
     realtime account management platform administered via a web interface
     that makes prepaid wireless plans as flexible and convenient as
     traditional postpaid plans debit card systems can include added costs for

   we continue to build an international network of verisign affiliates who
provide our digital trust services under licensed cobranding relationships
using our proprietary technology and business practices

   we believe our customer base is diversified and is not concentrated in any
particular industry in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer
has accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenues

research and development

   as of december 31 2001 we had approximately 350 employees dedicated to
research and development research and development expenses were 781 million
in 2001 413 million in 2000 and 133 million in 1999 to date all
development costs have been expensed as incurred we believe that timely
development of new and enhanced internetbased trust services and technology
are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace accordingly we intend
to continue recruiting and hiring experienced research and development
personnel and to make additional investments in research and development

   our future success will depend in large part on the ability to continue to
maintain and enhance our current technologies and services in the past we
have developed our services both independently and through efforts with leading
application developers and major customers we have also in certain
circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties including
public key cryptography technology from rsa security inc or rsa although we
will continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our
development efforts we expect that most of the future enhancements to existing
services and new digital trust services will be developed internally

   the markets for digital trust services and telecommunications services are
dynamic markets characterized by rapid technological developments frequent new
product introductions and evolving industry standards the constantly changing
nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to
continually improve the performance features and reliability of our digital
trust services and telecommunications services particularly in response to
competitive offerings and that we introduce both new and enhanced services as
quickly as possible and prior to our competitors

competition

   competition in digital trust services  our digital trust services are
targeted at the new and rapidly evolving market for trusted services including
authentication validation and payment that enable secure electronic commerce
and communications over wired and wireless ip networks although the
competitive environment in this market has yet to develop fully we anticipate
that it will be intensely competitive subject to rapid change and
significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other
market activities of industry participants

   principal competitors generally fall within one of three categories 1
companies such as baltimore technologies and entrust technologies which offer
software applications and related digital certificate products that customers
operate themselves 2 companies such as digital signature trust company a
subsidiary of zions bancorporation that primarily offer digital certificate
and certificate authority or ca related services and 3 companies focused
on providing a bundled offering of products and services such as baltimore
technologies which acquired gte cybertrust we also experience competition
from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary longterm
competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore netscape and
microsoft have introduced software products that enable

                                      10

page

the issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other
companies could introduce similar products

   in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or
otherwise feature them as a provider of digital certificate products and
services in their web browsers or on their web sites could also promote our
competitors or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future new
technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the
competitive pressure we can not assure that competing technologies developed
by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect
our competitive position or render our digital services or technologies
noncompetitive or obsolete in addition the market for digital certificates is
emerging and is characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships
involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any relationships
could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers as a result
of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able to compete effectively
with current or future competitors and competitive pressures that we face
could materially harm our business

   in connection with our first round of financing in 1995 rsa contributed
certain technology to us and entered into a noncompetition agreement under
which rsa agreed that it would not compete with our certificate authority
business for a period of five years this noncompetition agreement expired in
april 2000 rsa has recently entered into the digital certificate market and
our business could be materially harmed by their potential competition

   competition in digital brand management services  we face competition from
companies providing some of our digital brand management services in the
registration and domain name asset management area of our business our
competition comes from registercom among other companies in the monitoring
service competition comes from various smaller companies providing similar
services

   competition in web presence services  the web presence service market is
extremely competitive and subject to significant pricing pressure we currently
face competition among registrars within the global toplevel domains or
gtlds like com and in the future will face competition among registrars
within all new toplevel domains as of february 28 2002 there were over 145
icannaccredited registrars of which approximately 100 are active competitors
including us bulkregistercom deutsche telekom france telecomtranspac
godaddy software melbourne it registercom and tucowscom inc that
register secondlevel domain names in com net org and the other global top
level domains or gtlds we also face competition from thirdlevel domain name
providers such as internet access providers and registrars of country code
tlds we face substantial competition from other providers of valueadded web
presence services such as email providers web site designers internet
service providers and others

   competition in registry services  in november 2000 icann announced
selections for several new gtlds that once launched will directly compete
with the com net and org tlds as well as the cctlds offered by us two of
the new gtlds biz and info were launched in 2001 while other gtlds are
scheduled to launch in 2002 including name pro aero museum and coop
these gtlds are or will be available for registration through icann accredited
registrars in addition to our own registrar in addition we currently face
competition from the over 240 country code toplevel domain registry operators
who compete directly for the business of entities and individuals that are
seeking to establish a web presence

   we also face competition from registry service providers that offer
outsourced dns and registration services to organizations that require a
reliable and scalable infrastructure among the competitors are neulevel
affilias registercom and tucowscom

                                      11

   our primary competitors for managed dns services fall within two
serviceproduct categories dns hosting service providers and dns software and
appliance vendors dns hosting competitors include ultradns nominum and
easydns in addition the majority of the domain name registrars isps and web
hosting companies offer basic dns hosting as a part of their services dns
software or appliance competitors include major network and telecommunication
product vendors including lucent cisco and nortel which focus on ip address
management services

   competition in telecommunications services  the market for
telecommunications services is extremely competitive and subject to significant
pricing pressure competition in this area arises from two primary sources
large incumbent carriers provide competing services in their regions as a
result of regulatory requirements to promote competition in addition we face
direct competition on a nationwide basis from unregulated carriers including
telecommunications services inc or tsi and southern new england telephone
a unit of sbc communications our prepaid wireless services also compete with
services offered by boston communications group priority call
intervoicebrite and tsi

   competition in enterprise consulting and management services  consulting
companies or professional services groups of other companies with internet
expertise are current or potential competitors to our enterprise consulting
services these companies include large systems integrators and consulting
firms such as accenture formerly andersen consulting ibm global services and
lucent netcare we also compete with some companies that have developed
products that automate the management of ip addresses and name maps throughout
enterprisewide intranets and with companies with internallydeveloped systems
integration efforts

   several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other
resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we
can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer
requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established
distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or
services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such
competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers
the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the
ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our
services would be substantially diminished new technologies and the expansion
of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressure

industry regulation

   domain name registration  the cooperative agreement which our whollyowned
subsidiary network solutions inc entered into with the national science
foundation in december 1992 provided that we would perform internet domain
name registration services for the toplevel domains or tlds com net
 org edu and gov with the onset of increased commercial growth of the
internet the us government initiated activity directed at increased
privatization of the policymaking and central administration of the internet
within the us government leadership for the continued privatization of
internet administration is currently provided by the department of commerce

   on november 10 1999 we entered into a series of wideranging agreements
these agreements include the following

    a registry agreement between us and icann under which we will continue to
     act as the exclusive registry for the com net and org tlds for at
     least four years from that date this agreement was subsequently replaced
     with three new registry agreements on may 25 2001

                                      12

    a revised registrar accreditation agreement between icann and all
     registrars registering names in the com net and org domains

    a revised registrar license and agreement between us as registry and all
     registrars registering names in the com net and org domains using our
     proprietary shared registration system

    an amendment to the cooperative agreement and

    an amendment to the memorandum of understanding between the us
     government and icann

   the registry agreement with icann executed on november 10 1999 was replaced
by three new agreements on may 25 2001 one for com one for net and one for
 org the term of the com registry agreement extends until november 10 2007
with a 4year renewal option the terms of which are outlined in the agreement
the term of the net registry agreement extends at least until november 10
2003 and possibly until june 30 2005 depending on criteria set forth in the
agreement at which time the net registry services will be put out for
competitive bid by icann a process in which we will be allowed to participate
the term of the org registry agreement extends until december 31 2002 at
which time we are responsible for transitioning the services to a new registry
operator selected by icann

   the description of these agreements are qualified in their entirety by the
text of the complete agreements that are filed as exhibits to the periodic
reports indicated in the index to the exhibits contained in part iv of this
report

   pki services  exports of software products utilizing encryption technology
are generally restricted by the united states and various nonunited states
governments although we have obtained approval to export our server digital
certificate service and none of our other digital trust services are currently
subject to export controls under united states law the list of products and
countries for which export approval is required could be revised in the future
to include more digital certificate products and related services it is
possible that the terrorist acts of september 11 2001 will increase the
scrutiny of and further government restrictions on exportation of software
products utilizing encryption technology if we do not obtain required
approvals we may not be able to sell some of our digital trust services in
international markets

   there are currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control
certificate authorities but a limited number of states have enacted
legislation or regulations with respect to certificate authorities if we do
not comply with these state laws and regulations we will lose the statutory
benefits and protections that would be otherwise afforded to us moreover if
our market for digital certificates grows the united states federal or state
or nonunited states governments may choose to enact further regulations
governing certificate authorities or other providers of digital certificate
products and related services these regulations or the costs of complying with
these regulations could harm our business

   telecommunications services  one service provided by illuminets national
telemanagement corporation subsidiary is currently subject to federal
communications commission regulation this service allows wireless users who
are roaming in areas where their home carrier has not made arrangements for
automatic roaming service to complete calls to domestic and international
destinations national telemanagement corporation has a license from the fcc to
provide this service further illuminets telecommunications customers are
subject to fcc regulation which indirectly affects illuminets business we
cannot predict when or upon what terms and conditions further regulation or
deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or deregulation on our
business several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by
regulations imposed upon potential users of those services which may increase
our costs of operations in addition future services we may provide could be
subject to direct regulation

intellectual property

   we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks
patents restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our
intellectual property we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees consultants and current and potential affiliates customers and
business partners we also generally control access to and distribution of
documentation and other proprietary information

   we have been issued approximately ten patents and have filed more than sixty
applications for patents with respect to certain of our technology however
the us and foreign patent offices may not award any patents with respect to
these applications

   we have obtained us and foreign trademark registrations for various
verisign marks we have also filed numerous applications to register verisign
trademarks and claims and have common law rights in many other proprietary
names

   with regard to our digital trust services we also rely on certain licensed
thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography technology licensed
from rsa and other technology that is used in our digital trust services to
perform key functions in particular rsa has granted us a perpetual royalty
free nonexclusive worldwide license to distribute internetbased trust
services we develop services that contain or incorporate the rsa bsafe and
tipem products and that relate to digital certificateissuing software
software for the management of private keys and for digitally signing computer
files on behalf of others software for customers to preview and forward
digital certificate requests to them or such other services that in rsas
reasonable discretion are reasonably necessary for the implementation of a
digital certificate business rsas bsafe product is a software tool kit that
allows for the integration of encryption and authentication features into
software applications tipem is a secure email development tool kit that
allows for secure email messages to be sent using one vendors email product
and read by another vendors email product

   with regard to our domain name registration services our principal
intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon
proprietary software used in our registration service business and certain
methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and
implementation of our current and future registration services and
internetbased products and services businesses we own our proprietary shared
registration system through which competing registrars including our
registrars submit com net and org secondlevel domain name registrations
some of the software and protocols used in our registration services are in the
public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors we have compiled a
database of information relating to customers in our registration business
while some of this data is available to the public in the form of a directory
service we believe that we have certain ownership rights in this database and
we intend to protect these rights

                                 risk factors

   our business faces significant risks the risks described below may not be
the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we
currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations if any
of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur
our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and
the trading price of our common stock could decline

our limited operating history under our current business structure may result
in significant fluctuations of our financial results

   we were incorporated in april 1995 and began introducing our digital trust
services in june 1995 in addition we completed several acquisitions in 2000
and 2001 including our acquisitions of network solutions and illuminet both
of which companies operated in different businesses from our then current
business therefore we have only a limited operating history on which to base
an evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects our success will
depend on many factors including but not limited to the following

    the successful integration of the acquired companies

    the rate and timing of the growth and use of internet protocol or ip
     networks for electronic commerce and communications

    the timing and execution of individual customer contracts particularly
     large contracts

    the extent to which digital certificates and domain names are used for
     electronic commerce or communications

    the continued growth in the number of web sites

    the growth in demand for our services

    the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of
     conducting business

    the competition for any of our services

    the perceived security of electronic commerce and communications over ip
     networks

    the perceived security of our services technology infrastructure and
     practices

    the significant lead times before a product or service begins generating
     revenues

    the varying rates at which telecommunications companies telephony
     resellers and internet service providers use our services

    the loss of customers through industry consolidation or customer
     decisions to deploy inhouse technology and

    our continued ability to maintain our current and enter into additional
     strategic relationships

   to address these risks we must among other things

    successfully market our digital trust services to new and existing
     customers

    attract integrate train retain and motivate qualified personnel

    respond to competitive developments

                                      16

    successfully introduce new digital trust services and

    successfully introduce enhancements to our digital trust services to
     address new technologies and standards and changing market conditions

our business depends on the future growth of the internet and adoption and
continued use of ip networks

   our future success substantially depends on the continued growth in the use
of the internet and ip networks if the use of and interest in the internet and
ip networks does not continue to grow our business would be harmed to date
many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the internet
and ip networks for a number of reasons including but not limited to

    potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure

    security concerns particularly for online payments including the
     potential for merchant or user impersonation and fraud or theft of stored
     data and information communicated over ip networks

    privacy concerns including the potential for third parties to obtain
     personally identifiable information about users or to disclose or sell
     data without notice to or the consent of such users

    other security concerns such as attacks on popular web sites by hackers

    inconsistent quality of service

    lack of availability of costeffective highspeed systems and services

    limited number of local access points for corporate users

    inability to integrate business applications on ip networks

    the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products

    government regulation and

    a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of ip networks

   the widespread acceptance of the internet and ip networks will require a
broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging
information organizations that already have invested substantial resources in
other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods
also individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services
and effecting payments may be reluctant to change

we have sold our products to companies as part of broader business
relationships and revenues from these contracts may not be indicative of future
revenues

   we have purchased products and services from companies and participated in
financings of companies with whom we have entered into separate contractual
arrangements for the distribution and sale of our products and services we
derived approximately 38 of our total revenues in 2001 from reciprocal
arrangements typically in these relationships under separate agreements we
sell our products and services to a company and that company sells to us their
products and services or we under a separate agreement participate with other
investors in a private equity round financing of the company we derived no
revenues from customers from reciprocal arrangements in 2000 and 1999 we also
derived approximately 65 in 2001 28 in 2000 and 11 in 1999 of our total
revenues from customers with

                                      17

whom we have participated in a private equity round of financing including
several of the verisign affiliates as well as various technology companies in
a variety of related market areas we may not be able to sustain the revenue
growth we have experienced in recent periods if we do not continue to
participate in business relationships of this nature in addition past revenue
growth may not be indicative of future operating results

we may not be able to sustain the revenue growth we have experienced in the
past from our web presence services which depends in part upon our ability to
renew domain name registrations

   in 2000 the demand for new domain name registrations in our web presence
business increased substantially as a result of our promotional programs in
which we accepted domain name registrations at significant discounts and from
registrations by entities who registered domain names with the hopes of
reselling them many of those domain names have not been renewed as of their
twoyear anniversary date further many of the entrepreneurial and startup
businesses begun in 2000 have declined the future success of our web
presence services business will depend among other things upon our customers
renewal of their domain name registrations and upon our ability to obtain new
domain name registrations and to successfully market our valueadded product
and services to our domain mane registrants registrants may choose to renew
their domain names with other registrars or they may choose not to renew and
pay for renewal of their domain names since we deactivate and delete domain
name registrations that are not paid for our inability to obtain domain name
registration renewals from our customers could have an adverse effect on our
revenue growth and our business

our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our signaling and
intelligent network services at desired pricing levels could impact our ability
to maintain profitability or positive cash flow

   the telecommunications industry is characterized by significant price
competition competition and industry consolidation in our telecommunications
services could result in significant pricing pressure and an erosion in our
market share pricing pressure from competition could cause large reductions in
the selling price of our services for example our competitors may provide
customers with reduced communications costs for internet access or private
network services reducing the overall cost of services and significantly
increasing pricing pressures on us we may not be able to offset the effects of
any price reductions by increasing the number of our customers generating
higher revenues from enhanced services or reducing our costs we believe that
the business of providing network connectivity and related network services
will likely see increased consolidation in the future consolidation could
decrease selling prices and increase competition in these industries which
could erode our market share revenues and operating margins

issues arising from implementing agreements with icann and the department of
commerce could harm our domain name registration business

   the department of commerce or doc has adopted a plan for a phased
transition of the docs responsibilities for the domain name system to the
internet corporation for assigned names and numbers or icann we face risks
from this transition including the following

    icann could adopt or promote policies procedures or programs that are
     unfavorable to our role in the registration of domain names or that are
     inconsistent with our current or future plans

    the doc or icann could terminate our agreements to be the registry or a
     registrar in the com net and org toplevel domains if they find that
     we are in violation of our agreements with them

                                      18

page

    if our agreements to be the registry for the com org or net toplevel
     domains or a registrar for existing and new toplevel domains are
     terminated we may not be able to sustain the revenue growth we
     experienced in recent periods

    the terms of the registrar accreditation contract could change as a
     result of an icannadopted policy in a manner that is unfavorable to us

    the docs or icanns interpretation of provisions of our agreements with
     either of them could differ from ours

    the doc could revoke its recognition of icann as a result of which the
     doc would take the place of icann for purposes of the various agreements
     described above and could take actions that are harmful to us

    icann has approved new toplevel domains and we may not be permitted to
     act as a registrar with respect to some of those toplevel domains

    the us government could refuse to transfer certain responsibilities for
     domain name system administration to icann due to security stability or
     other reasons resulting in fragmentation or other instability in domain
     name system administration and

    our registry business could face legal or other challenges resulting from
     the activities of registrars

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our
web presence services business

   risks we face from challenges by third parties including other domestic and
foreign governmental authorities to our role in the ongoing privatization of
the internet include

    legal regulatory or other challenges could be brought including
     challenges to the agreements governing our relationship with the doc or
     icann or to the legal authority underlying the roles and actions of the
     doc icann or us

    congress has held several hearings in which various issues about the
     domain name system and icanns practices have been raised and congress
     could take action that is unfavorable to us

    icann could fail to maintain its role potentially resulting in
     instability in domain name system administration and

    some foreign governments and governmental authorities have in the past
     disagreed with and may in the future disagree with the actions policies
     or programs of icann the us government and us relating to the domain
     name system these foreign governments or governmental authorities may
     take actions or adopt policies or programs that are harmful to our
     business

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and
profitability are uncertain

   our quarterly operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly
in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside
our control these factors include the following

    the long sales and implementation cycles for and potentially large order
     sizes of some of our digital trust services and the timing and execution
     of individual customer contracts

    volume of domain name registrations and customer renewal rates through our
     web presence services business and our global registry service business

                                      19

    competition in the domain name registration services business from
     competing registrars and registries

    the mix of all our offered services sold during a quarter

    our success in marketing and market acceptance of our enterprise services
     network services web presence services and web trust services by our
     existing customers and by new customers

    continued development of our direct and indirect distribution channels
     both in the us and abroad

    a decrease in the level of spending for information technology related
     products and services by enterprise customers

    our success in assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired
     businesses

    the seasonal fluctuations in consumer use of telecommunications services

    the impact of price changes in our enterprise services network services
     web presence services web trust services or our competitors products and
     services and

    general economic and market conditions as well as economic and market
     conditions specific to ip network telecommunications and internet
     industries

   we expect an increase in our operating expenses if the increase in our
expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues our
operating results will suffer particularly as revenues from many of our
services are recognized ratably over the term of the service rather than
immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our sales and marketing
expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred

   due to all of the above factors our quarterly revenues and operating
results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod
comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and
you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance also
operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of
securities analysts or investors in one or more future quarters if this were
to occur the market price of our common stock would likely decline

   in addition the terrorist acts of september 11 2001 have created an
uncertain economic environment and we cannot predict the impact of these
events any subsequent terrorist acts or of any related military action on our
customers or business we believe that in light of these events some
businesses may curtail spending on information technology which could also
affect our quarterly results in the future

our industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively we
may suffer price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share

   we anticipate that the market for services that enable trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications over ip networks will remain intensely
competitive we compete with larger and smaller companies that provide products
and services that are similar to some aspects of our digital trust services
our competitors may develop new technologies in the future that are perceived
as being more secure effective or cost efficient than the technology
underlying our digital trust services we expect that competition will increase
in the near term and that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have
entered the market

   increased competition could result in pricing pressures reduced margins or
the failure of our digital trust services to achieve or maintain market
acceptance any of which could harm our business several of

                                      20

our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and
significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources as a
result we may not be able to compete effectively

   we face competition from large wellfunded regional providers of ss7
network services and related products such as regional bell operating
companies tsi and southern new england telephone a unit of sbc communication
the prepaid wireless account management and unregistered user services of
national telemanagement corporation a subsidiary of ours faces competition
from boston communications group priority call intervoicebrite and tsi we
are also aware of major internet service providers software developers and
smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on
developing and marketing products and services that will compete directly with
ours

   in connection with our first round of financing rsa contributed certain
technology to us and entered into a noncompetition agreement with us under
which rsa agreed that it would not compete with our certificate authority
business for a period of five years this noncompetition agreement expired in
april 2000 rsa has recently entered the digital certificate market and our
business could be materially harmed

   seven new global toplevel domain registries aero biz coop info
 museum name and pro have begun or are expected to begin accepting domain
name registrations in the near future since we will not serve as a registry
for these new toplevel domains we will not receive the annual registry fee
for domain name registrations under these toplevel domains the commencement
of registrations in these new toplevel domains could have the effect of
reduced demand for com and net domain name registrations if the new
toplevel domains reduce the demand for domain name registrations in com and
 net our business could be materially harmed

   the agreements among icann the doc us and other registrars permit
flexibility in pricing for and term of registrations our revenues therefore
could be reduced due to pricing pressures bundled service offerings and
variable terms from our competitors some registrars and resellers in the com
 net and org toplevel domains are already charging lower prices for
registration services in those domains in addition other entities are
bundling and may in the future bundle domain name registrations with other
products or services at reduced rates or for free

we may face difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with our
acquisition of illuminet holdings inc and any other future acquisitions

   we made several acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 we recently acquired
illuminet holdings inc which recently completed several acquisitions of its
own and ho systems inc we could experience difficulty in integrating the
personnel products technologies or operations of these companies
assimilating acquired businesses involves a number of other risks including
but not limited to

    the potential disruption of our ongoing business

    the potential impairment of relationships with our employees customers
     and strategic partners

    unanticipated costs or the incurrence of unknown liabilities

    the need to manage more geographicallydispersed operations such as our
     offices in virginia north carolina washington kansas south carolina
     south africa and europe

    greater than expected costs and the diversion of managements resources
     from other business concerns involved in identifying completing and
     integrating acquisitions

                                      21

page

    the inability to retain the employees of the acquired businesses

    adverse effects on the existing customer relationships of acquired
     companies

    the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the
     acquired businesses

    the potential incompatibility of business cultures

    any perceived adverse changes in business focus

    entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have
     little experience

    our inability to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our
     operations infrastructure

    the need to incur debt which may reduce our cash available for operations
     and other uses or issue equity securities which may dilute the ownership
     interests of our existing stockholders and

    the inability to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and
     policies

   if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future
acquisitions our business could be harmed

   additionally there is risk that we may incur additional expenses associated
with a writeoff of a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets as was
the case when we recorded a noncash charge of 99 billion in the second
quarter of 2001 related to write downs of goodwill due to changes in market
conditions for acquisitions made with our common stock under generally
accepted accounting principles we are required to evaluate goodwill for
impairment on an annual basis and to evaluate other intangible assets as events
or circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired these evaluations
could result in further write downs of goodwill or other intangible assets

our telecommunications services business depends on the acceptance of our ss7
network and the telecommunications markets continuing use of ss7 technology

   our future growth depends in part on the commercial success and
reliability of our ss7 network which we recently acquired through our merger
with illuminet holdings inc our ss7 network is a vital component of our
intelligent network services which had been an increasing source of revenues
for illuminet our network services business will suffer if our target
customers do not use our ss7 network our future financial performance will
also depend on the successful development introduction and customer acceptance
of new and enhanced ss7based services we are not certain that our target
customers will choose our particular ss7 network solution or continue to use
our ss7 network in the future we may not be successful in marketing our ss7
network or any new or enhanced services

our industry markets are evolving and if these markets fail to develop or if
our products are not widely accepted in these markets our business could
suffer

   we target our digital trust services at the market for trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications over ip networks this is a rapidly
evolving market that may not continue to grow

   accordingly the demand for our digital trust services is very uncertain
even if the market for electronic commerce and communications over ip networks
grows our digital trust services may not be widely accepted the factors that
may affect the level of market acceptance of digital certificates and
consequently our digital trust services include the following

    market acceptance of products and services based upon authentication
     technologies other than those we use

                                      22

page

    public perception of the security of digital certificates and ip networks

    the ability of the internet infrastructure to accommodate increased levels
     of usage and

    government regulations affecting electronic commerce and communications
     over ip networks

   even if digital certificates achieve market acceptance our digital trust
services may fail to address the markets requirements adequately if digital
certificates do not sustain or increase their acceptance or if our digital
trust services in particular do not achieve or sustain market acceptance our
business would be materially harmed

   the telecommunications network services industry is also characterized by
rapid technological change and frequent new product and service announcements
significant technological changes could make our technology obsolete we must
adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the
responsiveness reliability and features of our network and by developing new
network features services and applications to meet changing customer needs we
cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond
successfully or in a costeffective way to adequately meet them our failure to
do so would adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or
market share we sell our ss7 network services primarily to traditional
telecommunications companies that rely on traditional voice networks many
emerging companies are providing convergent internet protocolbased network
services our future revenues and profits if any could depend upon our
ability to provide products and services to these internet protocolbased
telephony providers

if we encounter system interruptions or security breaches we could be exposed
to liability and our reputation and business could suffer

   we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various domain name
registration systems secure data centers and other computer and communication
networks our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption
from

    power loss transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures

    damage or interruption caused by fire earthquake and other natural
     disasters

    computer viruses or software defects and

    physical or electronic breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism
     terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control

   most of our systems are located at and most of our customer information is
stored in our facilities in mountain view california and kawasaki japan
both of which are susceptible to earthquakes dulles and herndon virginia
lacey washington and overland park kansas though we have backup power
resources our california locations are susceptible to electric power shortages
similar to those experienced during 2001 all of our domain name registration
services systems including those used in our domain name registry and
registrar business are located at our dulles and herndon virginia facilities
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or
our other computer and communications systems could materially harm our
business

   in addition our ability to issue digital certificates and register domain
names depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections from
customers to our secure data centers and our various registration systems as
well as from customers to our registrar and from our registrar and other
registrars to the shared

                                      23

page

registration system these connections depend upon the efficient operation of
web browsers internet service providers and internet backbone service
providers all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced
outages in the past any of these problems or outages could decrease customer
satisfaction which could harm our business

   a failure in the operation of our various registration systems our domain
name zone servers the domain name root servers or other events could result in
the deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of
time a failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result
in the inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain
domain names for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the
master database that we maintain could result in the deletion of one or more
toplevel domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel
domain names in those toplevel domains for a period of time the inability of
our registrar systems including our back office billing and collections
infrastructure and telecommunications systems to meet the demands of a large
number of domain name registration requests and corresponding customer emails
and telephone calls including speculative otherwise abusive and repetitive
email domain name registration and modification requests could result in
substantial degradation in our customer support service and our ability to
process bill and collect registration requests in a timely manner

   we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data
centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business
strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived
by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registry operations also
depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment
in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against
interruption and potentially depends on protection by other registrars in the
shared registration system the root zone servers and toplevel domain name
zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our registry services
operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and money to
maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure

   despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to
physical breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers or similar
disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional
financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or
electronic breakin or other security breach or compromise of the information
stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may
jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the
computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could face
significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our digital trust
services such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and
therefore adversely affect the markets perception of the security of
electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the
security or reliability of our services

we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations and
californias recent energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our
expenses

   one of our secure data centers and one of our customer support call centers
are located in mountain view california in the summer of 2001 california
experienced an energy crisis and could again face an energy crisis that could
disrupt our operations and increase our expenses in the event of an acute
power shortage that is when power reserves for the state of california fall
below 15 california has on some occasions implemented and may in the future
continue to implement rolling blackouts throughout the state if blackouts
interrupt our power supply we may be temporarily unable to operate any such
interruption in our ability to continue operations could delay the development
of our products future interruptions could damage our reputation harm our
ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new

                                      24

page

customers and could result in lost revenue any of which could substantially
harm our business and results of operations

   furthermore the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in 1996 by
the california government and shortages in wholesale electricity supplies have
caused power prices to increase if wholesale prices continue to increase our
operating expenses will likely increase as our headquarters and many of our
employees are based in california

some of our investments in other companies have resulted in losses and may
result in losses in the future

   we have investments in a number of companies in most instances these
investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of private companies
for which there is no public market these companies are typically in the early
stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses
therefore these companies may never become publicly traded companies even if
they do an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we
may never realize any return on these investments further if these companies
are not successful we could incur charges related to writedowns or writeoffs
of these types of assets due to the recent volatility in the stock market in
general and the market prices of securities of technology companies in
particular during 2001 we determined that the decline in value of some of our
public and private equity security investments was other than temporary and
recognized a loss of 891 million related to the decline in value of these
investments due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments
and in light of current stock market conditions we may incur future losses on
the sales writedowns or writeoffs of our investments

the inability of our customers to successfully implement our signaling and
network services with their existing systems could adversely affect our
business

   significant technical challenges exist in our signaling and network services
business because many of our customers

    purchase and implement ss7 network services in phases

    deploy ss7 connectivity across a variety of telecommunication switches and
     routes and

    integrate our ss7 network with a number of legacy systems thirdparty
     software applications and engineering tools

   customer implementation currently requires participation by our order
management and our engineering and operations groups each of which has limited
resources some customers may also require us to develop costly customized
features or capabilities which increase our costs and consume a
disproportionate share of our limited customer service and support resources
also we typically charge onetime flat rate fees for initially connecting a
customer to our ss7 network and a monthly recurring flat rate fee after the
connection is established if new or existing customers have difficulty
deploying our products or require significant amounts of our engineering
service support we may experience reduced operating margins our customers
ability to deploy our network services to their own customers and integrate
them successfully within their systems depends on our customers capabilities
and the complexity involved difficulty in deploying those services could
reduce our operating margins due to increased customer support and could cause
potential delays in recognizing revenues until the services are implemented

                                      25

our inability to introduce and implement technological changes in our industry
could harm our business

   the emerging nature of the internet digital certificate business the
domain name registration business and payment services business and their
rapid evolution require us continually to improve the performance features
and reliability of our digital trust services particularly in response to
competitive offerings we must also introduce any new digital trust services
as quickly as possible the success of new digital trust services depends on
several factors including proper new service definition and timely completion
introduction and market acceptance we may not succeed in developing and
marketing new digital trust services that respond to competitive and
technological developments and changing customer needs this could harm our
business

capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be
difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems
to meet increased use

   as traffic from our telecommunication customers through our network
increases we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network
hardware and software we may not be able to accurately project the rate of
increase in usage on our network in addition we may not be able to expand and
upgrade in a timely manner our systems and network hardware and software
capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network if we do not
appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software
we may lose customers and revenues

we have experienced significant growth in our business and our failure to
manage this growth or any future growth could harm our business

   our historical growth has placed and any further growth is likely to
continue to place a significant strain on our resources we have grown from 26
employees at december 31 1995 to over 3200 employees at december 31 2001 in
addition to internal growth our employee base grew through acquisitions we
have also opened additional sales offices and have significantly expanded our
operations both in the us and abroad during this time period to be
successful we will need to implement additional management information
systems continue the development of our operating administrative financial
and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our
executive engineering accounting finance marketing sales and operations
organizations any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively

   we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key
employees our success will also depend on our ability to attract integrate
train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled
technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad in
addition our stringent hiring practices for some of our key personnel which
consist of background checks into prospective employees criminal and financial
histories further limit the number of qualified persons for these positions

   we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent
them from leaving verisign at any time in addition we do not maintain key
person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees the loss of the
services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure
to attract integrate train retain and motivate additional key employees
could harm our business

                                      26

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route
internet communications

   we currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers
the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a
volunteer basis because of the importance to the functioning of the internet
of these root zone servers our global registry services business could be
harmed if these volunteer operators fail to maintain these servers properly or
abandon these servers which would place additional capacity demands on the two
root zone servers we operate

   further our global registry services business could be harmed if any of
these volunteer operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the data
that it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and
to the extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an
authoritative root server system as provided in our registry agreement with
icann it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to the
toplevel domain zone servers designated by us if icann does not do this our
business could be harmed

   our web presence services and registry services businesses also could be
harmed if a significant number of internet service providers decided not to
route internet communications to or from domain names registered by us or if a
significant number of internet service providers decided to provide routing to
a set of domain name servers that did not point to our domain name zone servers

our signaling and network services reliance on third party communications
infrastructure hardware and software exposes us to a variety of risks we
cannot control

   our signaling and network services success will depend on our network
infrastructure including the capacity leased from telecommunications
suppliers in particular we rely on att worldcom sprint and other
telecommunications providers for leased longhaul and local loop transmission
capacity these companies provide the dedicated links that connect our network
components to each other and to our customers our business also depends upon
the capacity reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third
parties that is used to connect telephone calls specifically we currently
lease capacity from regional partners on seven of the fourteen mated pairs of
ss7 signal transfer points that comprise our network we have no control over
the operation quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that
infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve
their equipment we depend on these companies to maintain the operational
integrity of our connections if one or more of these companies is unable or
unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future our
operations could be severely interrupted in addition rapid changes in the
telecommunications industry have led to the merging of many companies these
mergers may cause the availability pricing and quality of the services we use
to vary and could cause the length of time it takes to deliver the services
that we use to increase significantly we rely on links equipment and software
provided to us from our vendors the most important of which are gateway
equipment and software from tekelec and agilent technologies inc we cannot
assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase equipment from these
vendors on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to maintain current
purchasing terms or ensure product availability with these vendors we may lose
customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative suppliers
of products and services

we must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships

   one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic
or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger
customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and

                                      27

marketing efforts we may need to enter into additional relationships to
execute our business plan we may not be able to enter into additional or
maintain our existing strategic relationships on commercially reasonable
terms if we fail to enter into additional relationships we would have to
devote substantially more resources to the distribution sale and marketing of
our enterprise services telecommunications services and web presence services
than we would otherwise

   our success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both
on the ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships
particularly in the use and promotion of ip networks for trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications and on the ability of these parties to
market our enterprise services successfully

   furthermore our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our
ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple
distribution channels particularly with respect to our web presence services
business to do this we must maintain relationships with internet access
providers and other third parties failure of one or more of our strategic
relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our
web presence services could harm our business many of our existing
relationships do not and any future relationships may not afford us any
exclusive marketing or distribution rights in addition the other parties may
not view their relationships with us as significant for their own businesses
therefore they could reduce their commitment to us at any time in the future
these parties could also pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative
products and services either on their own or in collaboration with others
including our competitors if we are unable to maintain our relationships or to
enter into additional relationships this could harm our business

some of our enterprise services have lengthy sales and implementation cycles

   we market many of our enterprise services directly to large companies and
government agencies the sale and implementation of our services to these
entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant
technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources this
process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers
internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital
expenditures deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and
accepting new technologies that affect key operations as a result the sales
and implementation cycles associated with certain of our enterprise services
can be lengthy potentially lasting from three to six months our quarterly and
annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders forecasted for a
specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized

undetected or unknown defects in our services could harm our business and
future operating results

   services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain
undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in
our existing or new services which could result in loss of or delay in
revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion
of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims
increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which
could harm our business furthermore we often provide implementation
customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the
implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically
involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications
systems our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely
manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share
failure to achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased
costs

our enterprise and affiliate pki services and web trust services rely on public
key cryptography technology that may compromise our systems security

   our enterprise and affiliate pki services depend on public key cryptography
technology with public key cryptography technology a user is given a public
key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and
decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the
integrity of a users private key and that it is not lost stolen or otherwise
compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the
application of specific mathematical principles known as factoring this
integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers
into their prime number components is difficult should an easy factoring
method be developed the security of encryption products utilizing public key
cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any
significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could
also render some or all of our existing pki services obsolete or unmarketable
if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed
we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or all of our
customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our
business in the past there have been public announcements of the successful
attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of the
potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this type
of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the
public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this
negative public perception could harm our business

the expansion of our international operations subjects our business to
additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our revenues and
business

   revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for
approximately 13 of our revenues in 2001 14 in 2000 and 27 in 1999 we
intend to expand our international operations and international sales and
marketing activities for example in addition to our past acquisitions of
thawte with operations in south africa network solutions with operations in
asia and europe we have continued to focus on expanding our operations and
marketing activities throughout asia europe and latin america expansion into
these markets has required and will continue to require significant management
attention and resources we may also need to tailor our digital trust services
for a particular market and to enter into international distribution and
operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our services
and in developing international distribution or operating relationships we may
not succeed in expanding our services into international markets failure to do
so could harm our business in addition there are risks inherent in doing
business on an international basis including among others

    competition with foreign companies or other domestic companies entering
     the foreign markets in which we operate

    regulatory requirements

    legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with foreign laws

    export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products
     incorporating that technology

    tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions

    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations

    longer sales and payment cycles

    problems in collecting accounts receivable

                                      29

    currency fluctuations as all of our international revenues from verisign
     japan kk our wholly owned subsidiaries in south africa and europe are
     not denominated in us dollars

    difficulty of authenticating customer information

    political instability

    failure of foreign laws to protect our us proprietary rights adequately

    more stringent privacy policies in foreign countries

    additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting american
     interests abroad

    seasonal reductions in business activity and

    potentially adverse tax consequences

   we have licensed to verisign affiliates our processing center platform
which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the
affiliate to offer backend processing of enterprise pki services the verisign
processing center platform provides a verisign affiliate with the knowledge and
technology to offer enterprise pki services similar to those offered by us it
is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and infrastructure
used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure and we are
perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the verisign
affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and
customer service and support these practices are performed by the affiliate
and are outside of our control

   any failure of a verisign affiliate to maintain the privacy or security of
confidential customer information could result in negative publicity and
therefore adversely affect the markets perception of the security of our
services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over
ip networks generally

   in july 2001 we enhanced our managed public key infrastructure services
processes in order to satisfy the european unions directive on digital
signatures which we hope will stimulate the acceptance of digital signatures
in europe we cannot guarantee that our enhancements will be accepted by or
introduced and marketed successfully in the european markets in addition we
cannot predict whether the european union commission will amend or alter the
directive or introduce new legislation nor can we predict the impact such a
change in legislation could have on our international business and operations

we rely on our intellectual property and any failure by us to protect or any
misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business

   our success depends on our internally developed technologies and other
intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third
party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other forms of
our intellectual property without authorization furthermore the laws of
foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to
the same extent us law protects these rights in the united states in
addition it is possible that others may independently develop substantially
equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our
intellectual property our business could suffer in the future we may have to
resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect
our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary
rights of others this type of litigation regardless of its outcome could
result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources

                                      30

   we also license thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography
technology licensed from rsa and other technology that is used in our products
to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not
continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our
business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies a third
party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other
proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between
us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not
indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able
to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all
the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology
licenses could delay the introduction of our internet infrastructure services
until equivalent technology if available is identified licensed and
integrated this could harm our business

our services employ technology that may infringe the proprietary rights of
others and we may be liable for significant damages as a result

   infringement or other claims could be made against us in the future any
claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly
litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel cause delays or
require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or
licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be
available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of infringement
were made against us and we could not develop noninfringing technology or
license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and costeffective
basis our business could be harmed

   in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and
scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated
businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the
internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously
and simultaneously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology
there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent
applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and
is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding
patent and other intellectual property rights for example we have had two
complaints filed against us in february 2001 and february 2002 alleging patent
infringement see item 3 legal proceedings

we have antitakeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control
that could benefit our stockholders

   our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain
provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us
without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include

    our stockholders may take action only at a meeting and not by written
     consent

    our board must be given advance notice regarding stockholdersponsored
     proposals for consideration at annual meetings and for stockholder
     nominations for the election of directors

    we have a classified board of directors with the board being divided into
     three classes that serve staggered threeyear terms

    vacancies on our board may be filled until the next annual meeting of
     stockholders only by majority vote of the directors then in office and

    special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of
     the board the president or the board not by our stockholders

item 3  legal proceedings

   as of february 11 2002 through our network solutions subsidiary we were a
defendant in nine active lawsuits involving domain name disputes between
trademark owners and domain name holders we are drawn into such disputes in
part as a result of claims by trademark owners that we are legally required
upon request by a trademark owner to terminate the contractual right we
granted to a domain name holder to register a domain name which is alleged to
be similar to the trademark in question on october 25 1999 however the
ninth circuit court of appeals ruled in our favor and against lockheed
corporation holding that our services do not make us liable for contributory
infringement to trademark owners since that time the frequency of this type
of suit has continued to decline the holders of the domain name registrations
in dispute have in turn questioned our right absent a court order to take
any action that affects their contractual rights to the domain names in
question although 87 of these kinds of situations have resulted in suits
actually naming network solutions as a defendant as of february 11 2002 no
adverse judgment has been rendered and no award of damages has ever been made
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and we intend to vigorously defend
ourselves against these claims

   on february 2 2001 leon stambler filed a complaint against us alleging
patent infringement in the united states district court for the district of
delaware the other codefendants named in the complaint were rsa security
inc first data corporation openwave systems inc and omnisky corporation
the complaint alleges that our secure site service infringes claim 12 of mr
stamblers us patent no 5793302 and that our payflow products infringe
claims 1 28 and 34 of mr stamblers us patent no 5974148 the complaint
seeks judgment declaring that the defendants have infringed the asserted claims
of the patentsinsuit preliminary and permanent injunctions against the
defendants from infringing the asserted claims an order requiring the
defendants to pay damages to compensate mr stambler for the alleged
infringement and an order awarding mr stambler treble damages for any willful
infringement as well as attorney fees and costs on september 24 2001 mr
stambler amended his complaint adding certicom corporation as a defendant and
asserting that our payflow products also infringe claims 25 and 27 of mr
stamblers us patent no 5936541 subsequently the parties to the
litigation engaged in extensive discovery

   on december 21 2001 mr stambler supplemented his discovery responses
significantly expanding his allegations through these supplemental responses
mr stambler contends that we infringe claims 12 and 34 of the 302 patent
claims 1 16 28 and 35 of the 148 patent and claims 25 and 27 of the 541
patent additionally mr stambler significantly expanded the list of accused
products to include the following products services and protocols

digital ids webtrust wap related products electronic data interchange and
financial server ids mr stambler also contends that our use of products in
connection with certain third party technology infringes his patents including
intershop cartridges and qualysguard ssl while we cannot predict the outcome
of this matter presently we believe that the claims against us are without
merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims

the outcome of this matter presently we believe that the claims against us are
without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims

states district court for the northern district of california the case
entitled william hoefer et al v us department of commerce et al civil

   on january 13 2000 the department of justice antitrust division issued a
civil investigative demand or cid seeking information and documents
concerning the thenpending acquisition by us of thawte we provided certain
information and documents to the department of justice and closed the thawte
transaction on february 1 2000 we completed our initial response to the cid
on march 1 2000 and a supplemental production of documents was completed may
9 2000 on september 14 2000 we were notified that senior officials at the
department of justice had reviewed a report by the investigatory staff
regarding the transaction and that the department had concerns about the
potential competitive effects of the transaction our representatives met with
and provided additional information to the department of justice during october
2000 on march 11 2002 we were notified by the department of justice that the
matter has been closed and no further action will be taken

   we are involved in various other investigations claims and lawsuits arising
in the normal conduct of our business none of which in our opinion will harm
our business we cannot assure that we will prevail in any litigation
regardless of the outcome any litigation may require us to incur significant
litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management
attention

   on february 28 2002 there were 993 holders of record of our common stock
although we believe there are in excess of 160000 beneficial owners on
february 28 2002 the reported last sale price of our common stock was 2373
per share

   the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to
be highly volatile and significantly affected by factors such as

    general market and economic conditions and market conditions affecting
     technology and internet stocks generally

    announcements of technological innovations acquisitions or investments
     developments in internet governance or corporate actions such as stock
     splits and

    industry conditions and trends

   the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue
to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors reports
and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views the fact that
we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not
necessarily mean that we will do so in the future

   in the past securities class action lawsuits have often followed periods of
volatility in the market price of a particular companys securities this type
of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our
managements attention and resources

   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock or
other securities and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the
foreseeable future we currently intend to retain our earnings if any for
future growth

   critical accounting policies

   the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires
management

                                      42

to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its
estimates including those related to revenue recognition doubtful accounts
investments and longlived assets management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions

   we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated
financial statements

   revenue recognition

   we derive revenues from three primary categories web presence and trust
services which include domain name registration services web trust services
and payment services managed security and network services which include
enterprise and affiliate pki services and enterprise consulting services and
registry and telecommunications services which include registry services
connectivity intelligent networks wireless and clearinghouse services the
revenue recognition policy for each of these areas is as follows

   domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees
charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services
revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name registration services are
deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term generally one to
two years and up to ten years

   domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on
recent renewal and collection rates customers are notified of the expiration
of their registration in advance and we record the receivables for estimated
renewal fees in the month preceding the anniversary date of their registration
when we have a right to bill under the terms of domain name registration
agreements the variance between the actual collections and the rate used to
estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the setting of prospective renewal
rates fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are
deferred until the new incremental period commences these fees are then
recognized ratably over the new registration term ranging from one to ten
years

   revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business
process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements
including postcontract customer support training and other services these
licenses which do not provide for right of return are primarily perpetual
licenses for which revenues are recognized up front once all criteria for
revenue recognition have been met

   revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and
recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate generally 12
months revenues from the sale of onsite managed services are deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of the license generally 12 to 36 months
maintenance is bundled with onsite licenses over the license term

   we recognize revenues from issuances of digital certificates and business
process licensing to verisign affiliates in accordance with sop 972 software
revenue recognition as amended by sop 989 and generally recognize revenues
when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph 8 of sop
972 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has
occurred

                                      43

page

3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectibility is probable we
define each of these four criteria as follows

   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  it is our customary practice
to have a written contract which is signed by both the customer and us or a
purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard
license arrangement with us

   delivery has occurred our software may be either physically or
electronically delivered to the customer electronic delivery is deemed to have
occurred upon download by the customer from an ftp server if an arrangement
includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the
functionality of the delivered product delivery is not considered to have
occurred until these products or services are delivered

   the fee is fixed or determinable  it is our policy to not provide customers
the right to a refund of any portion of its license fees paid we may agree to
extended payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs
generally at least 80 of the arrangement fees are due within one year or
less arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment
terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable and revenues from such
arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable

   collectibility is probable  collectibility is assessed on a
customerbycustomer basis we typically sell to customers for whom there is a
history of successful collection new customers are subjected to a credit
review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately
their ability to pay if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that
collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process revenues
are recognized as cash is collected

   we allocate revenues on software arrangements involving multiple elements to
each element based on the relative fair values of each element our
determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is
based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe we limit our assessment
of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold
separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our
multipleelement arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to
allocate revenues to maintenance and support service professional services and
training components of our perpetual license arrangements we sell our
professional services and training separately and have established vsoe on
this basis vsoe for maintenance and support is determined based upon the
customers annual renewal rates for these elements accordingly assuming all
other revenue recognition criteria are met revenues from perpetual licenses
are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop
989 we recognize revenues from licenses in which maintenance is bundled with
the software license such as for digital certificates digital certificate
provisioning and onsite managed services ratably over the license term of one
to three years

   our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of
the software our software products are fully functional upon delivery and
implementation and do not require any significant modification or alteration
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our
technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being
performed but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other
consulting service organizations to provide these services software products
are billed separately and independently from consulting services which are
generally billed on a timeandmaterials or milestoneachieved basis we
generally recognize revenues from consulting services as the services are
performed

   revenues from consulting and training services are recognized using the
percentageofcompletion method for fixedfee development arrangements or as
the services are provided for timeandmaterials

                                      44

page

arrangements revenues from thirdparty product sales are recognized when title
to the products sold passes to the customer our shipping terms generally
dictate that the passage of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the
customer

   revenues from payment services primarily consist of a setup fee and a
monthly service fee for the transaction processing services in accordance with
sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in
financial statements revenues from the setup fee are deferred and recognized
ratably over the period that the fees are earned revenues from the service
fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are
provided advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably
to revenue over the periods the services are provided

   revenues from telecommunications services are comprised of network
connectivity revenues and intelligent network services revenues network
connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection
to our ss7 network and trunk signaling services revenues from network
connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees and trunk signaling
service revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a
customer signals the initial connection fee and related costs are deferred and
recognized over the term of the arrangement intelligent network services
which include calling card validation local number portability wireless
services tollfree database access and caller identification are derived
primarily from database administration and database query services and are
charged on a peruse or perquery basis prepaid wireless account management
services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue we
retain and recognized in the period in which we process such calls on a
perminute or percall basis

   clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a
distribution and collection point for billing information and payment
collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another
clearinghouse revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed

   on occasion we have purchased goods or services for our operations from
organizations such as ibm oracle phoenix technologies and infospace at or
about the same time that we licensed our software to these organizations these
transactions are recorded at terms we consider to be fair value for these
reciprocal arrangements we consider accounting principles board abp
opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions and emerging issues
task force eitf issue no 0102 interpretation of apb opinion no 29 to
determine whether the arrangement is a monetary or nonmonetary transaction
transactions involving the exchange of boot representing 25 or greater of the
fair value of the reciprocal arrangement are considered monetary transactions
within the context of apb opinion no 29 and eitf issue no 0102 monetary
transactions and nonmonetary transactions that represent the culmination of an
earnings process are recorded at the fair value of the products delivered or
products or services received whichever is more readily determinable
providing the fair values are determinable within reasonable limits in
determining the fair values we consider the recent history of cash sales of
the same products or services in similar sized transactions revenues from such
transactions may be recognized over a period of time as the products or
services are received for nonmonetary reciprocal arrangements that do not
represent the culmination of the earnings process the exchange is recorded
based on the carrying value of the products delivered which is generally zero

   in 2001 we recognized revenues under reciprocal arrangements of
approximately 375 million of which 270 million involved nonmonetary
transactions as defined above we did not recognize any revenues under
reciprocal arrangements as defined above in 2000 and 1999

   allowance for doubtful accounts

   we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of our customers to make required payments we regularly
review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the
size of the accounts receivable balance each customers expected ability to
pay and our collection history with each customer we review significant
invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on
the risk category using the factors described above in addition we maintain a
general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age
category we also monitor our accounts receivable for any build up of
concentration to any one customer industry or geographic region to date our
receivables have not had any particular concentrations that if not collected
would have a significant impact on our operating income we require all
acquired companies to adopt our credit policies the allowance for doubtful
accounts represents our best estimate but changes in circumstances relating to
accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in
the future

   investments

   we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for business
and strategic purposes some of these companies are publicly traded and have
highly volatile share prices however in most instances these investments are
in the form of equity and debt securities of private companies for which there
is no public market these companies are typically in the early stage of
development and may be expected to incur substantial losses therefore these
companies may never become publicly traded companies even if they do an
active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never
realize any return on these investments further if these companies are not
successful we could incur charges related to writedowns or writeoffs of
these types of assets

   we review our marketable equity holdings in publiclytraded companies on a
regular basis to determine if any security has experienced an
otherthantemporary decline in fair value we consider the investee companys
cash position earnings and revenue outlook stock price performance over the
past six months liquidity and management ownership among other factors in
our review if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline exists in a
marketable equity security we write down the investment to its market value
and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated
statements of operations for nonpublic companies we regularly review the
assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based
on information requested from these privately held companies generally this
information may be more limited may not be as timely and may be less accurate
than information available from publicly traded companies assessing each
investments carrying value requires significant judgment by management if we
determine that an otherthantemporary decline exists in a nonpublic equity
security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related
writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations
generally if cash balances are insufficient to sustain the companys
operations for a sixmonth period we consider the decline in fair value to be
other than temporary during 2001 we determined that the decline in value of
certain of our public and nonpublic equity investments was other than
temporary and recorded a writedown of these investments totaling 891 million

   longlived assets

   our longlived assets consist primarily of goodwill and other intangible
assets and property and equipment we review longlived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of such an asset may not be recoverable such events or circumstances

                                      46

page

include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of
the underlying business a significant decrease in the benefits realized from
the acquired business difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a
significant change in the operations of the acquired business

   recoverability of longlived assets is measured by comparison of the
carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are
expected to generate those cash flows include an estimated terminal value
based on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of its goodwill
amortization period estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires
management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our services
sustainability of gross margins our ability to integrate acquired companies
and achieve economies of scale and valuation multiples required by investors
or buyers changes in these estimates could require us to further write down
the carrying amount of our longlived assets if assets are considered to be
impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value

   effective january 1 2002 we will assess impairment of goodwill in
accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 the provisions of sfas no 142
require that a twostep test be performed first the fair value of each of our
reporting units will be compared to its carrying value if the fair value
exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is
performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the implied fair
value of the reporting units goodwill must be determined and compared to the
carrying value of the goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting units
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss equal to the
difference will be recorded

results of operations

   we have experienced substantial net losses in the past substantially due to
the charges we incurred for the amortization and write down of acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions as of
december 31 2001 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 165
billion primarily due to the amortization and writedown of goodwill and other
intangible assets of approximately 168 billion related to our acquisitions
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill will no longer be
amortized to earnings commencing january 1 2002 instead goodwill will be
reviewed for impairment as of january 1 2002 and annually thereafter or more
often if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred
amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately 84
million per quarter in 2002 including the impact of all acquisitions through
december 31 2001 excluding the impact of ho systems and assuming no other
acquisitions or impairment charges

   we accounted for all of our acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 as purchase
business combinations accordingly the acquired companies revenues costs and
expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their
dates of acquisition as a result of our acquisitions of thawte and signio in
february 2000 network solutions in june 2000 and illuminet in december 2001
comparisons of revenues costs and expenses for the year ended december 31
2001 to the years ended december 31 2000 and 1999 may not be relevant as the
businesses of the combined company were not equivalent

 in 1999 we derived all of our revenues from our enterprise services under
  one reportable segment

   revenues increased significantly in 2001 from 2000 for both our enterprise
and service provider division and our mass markets division the increases were
primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 sales of
authentication services particularly web site digital certificates and
enterprise and affiliate pki services also increased in addition we expanded
the verisign trust network of worldwide affiliates and saw increased demand for
our training and consulting services

   the increase in revenues in 2000 from 1999 is primarily due to the
acquisitions of thawte signio and network solutions in addition we increased
sales of our authentication services particularly our web site digital
certificates and enterprise and affiliate pki services expanded our
international affiliate network and delivered more training and consulting
services

   in 2001 we derived 38 of our total revenues from reciprocal arrangements
we derived no revenues from customers from reciprocal arrangements in 2000 and
1999 typically in these relationships under separate agreements we sell our
products and services to a company and that company sells to us their products
and services we enter into these arrangements for strategic business purposes
and the goods and services we receive in exchange are those we would have
purchased in nonreciprocal arrangements these arrangements are independent
relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are
violated

   we derived 65 in 2001 28 in 2000 and 11 in 1999 of our total revenues
from customers with whom we have participated in a private equity round of
financing including several of the verisign affiliates as well as various
technology companies in a variety of related market areas typically in these
relationships under separate agreements we sell our products and services to
a company and under a separate agreement participate with other investors in
a private equity round financing of the company we typically make our
investments with others where our investment is less than 50 of the total
financing round our policy is not to recognize revenue in excess of other
investors financing of the company these arrangements are independent
relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are
violated

   enterprise and service provider division

   enterprise and service provider division revenues from external customers
were 4285 million in 2001 1921 million in 2000 and 848 million in 1999

                                      48

page

   in 2001 revenues from the managed security and network services product
line increased approximately 150 million to 298 million in 2001 from 148
million in 2000 the revenue increase was primarily due to increases in onsite
services sold software licenses sold to the 13 new affiliate service
providers an increase in royalties earned from existing affiliates and an
overall increase in the volume of consulting services that included the resale
of third party products third party software and hardware sales are generally
made at lower margins than our other enterprise and mass market sales

   in 2001 revenues from registry and telecommunications services increased
approximately 86 million to 131 million in 2001 from 44 million in 2000
this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of a full year of registry
services revenue compared to approximately seven months in 2000 as a result of
the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 revenues related to
outsourced managed registry services also increased the verisign global
registry services group managed approximately 288 million domain names at
december 31 2001 in the active zone file for all domain names ending in com
 net and org the global registry services group also processed the renewal
extension or transfer of 89 million domain names during 2001 bringing the
total number of paid domain name transactions during 2001 to 220 million

   mass market division

   mass market division revenues from external customers were 5551 million in
2001 2826 million in 2000 and zero in 1999

   in 2001 the increase in revenues in the mass market division was primarily
due to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from web presence services
compared to approximately seven months in 2000 as a result of the acquisition
of network solutions in june 2000

   during 2001 we added approximately 41 million new domain names and renewed
or extended an additional 49 million domain names bringing the total active
domain names under management by the registrar to approximately 136 million at
december 31 2001 which does not include approximately 17 million domain
names past their anniversary dates that have been deactivated from the zone
files but not yet deleted from the web presence services whois database in
2000 the demand for new domain name registrations in our web presence business
increased substantially as a result of our promotional programs and from
registrations by entities who registered domain names with the hopes of
reselling them many of those promotional and speculator domain names have not
been renewed and have already been deactivated from the active zone file
maintained by the verisign global registry in addition due to the competitive
market in domain names we have experienced moderate price declines in sales
prices for domain names we expect that this situation will continue

   our mass markets division and our enterprise and service provider division
issued approximately 366000 new and renewed web site digital certificates in
2001 compared to 274000 in 2000 and 112000 in 1999 the total installed base
was over 366000 certificates at december 31 2001 in particular the mass
markets division web site certificate base increased by 50000 installed
certificates in 2001 to a total of 260000 certificates at december 31 2001
the increase in sales of web site digital certificates in 2001 contributed
approximately 25 million to the increase in revenues in addition due to
increased competition in the web trust services market we have experienced
moderate pricing pressure for our services we expect that this pricing
pressure will continue

   international revenues

   revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates accounted
for 13 of total revenues in 2001 14 in 2000 and 27 in 1999 the percentage
decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in
2001 compared to 2000 and 1999 was primarily related to the acquisition in june
2000 of network solutions whose revenues are primarily attributable to us
sources this was partially offset by additional revenues from international
subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in 2001 related to an increase in the
number of verisign affiliates in the verisign trust network combined with other
activities to expand our presence in foreign markets

   in 1998 we began our international affiliate program under which we signed
agreements with local telecommunications companies financial institutions and
others to promote sell and distribute our pki services in international
markets around the world these verisign affiliates typically require
significant capital development the cost of which is borne by the affiliate
our strategy from time to time also includes investing in certain affiliates in
strategic markets that represent advantageous economic opportunities for a
minority interest of less than 20 as a result we have invested in several
international affiliates in 2001 and prior years revenues from verisign
affiliates in which we have invested accounted for 45 of total revenues in
2001 15 in 2000 and 11 in 1999

   costs and expenses

   cost of revenues

   cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital
certificate enrollment and issuance services payment services domain name
registration services customer support and training consulting and
development services and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in

percentage of revenues       35              34             38


   growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of
revenues in 2001 from 2000 and in 2000 from 1999 we hired more employees to
support the growth of demand for our products and services and to support the
growth of our consulting and training services we incurred increased expenses
for access to thirdparty databases to verify digital certificate applicants
identities increased customer service costs related to our larger customer
base and increased expenses related to the cost of hardware and software
products resold to customers as part of our consulting business we anticipate
that cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result
of continued growth in all of our lines of business our acquisitions of
thawte signio and network solutions have resulted in an increase in our cost
of revenues since their acquisitions in 2000 our recent acquisitions of
illuminet in december 2001 and ho systems in february 2002 will further
increase the dollar amount of our cost of revenues future

acquisitions further expansion into international markets and introduction of
new products will result in additional increases in cost of revenues due to
the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses and other factors

   cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in 2001 from
2000 primarily due to the cost structure of the network solutions product mix
and the increase in the volume of third party hardware and software sales
which was partially offset by economies of scale associated with the growth in
recurring revenues from existing customers the decrease in 2000 from 1999 was
primarily a result of the continued realization of economies of scale from our
technology infrastructure and the efficiency gains in the certificate
enrollment and issuance process

   certain of our services such as consulting and training require greater
initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types
of services in addition revenues derived from our authentication services
domain name registration services registry services payment services and our
telecommunications services as a result of our recent acquisition of illuminet
each have different cost structures as a result we anticipate that cost of
revenues as a percentage of revenues will increase in the near term

   sales and marketing

   sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and
marketing and policy activities these expenses include salaries sales
commissions and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related expenses
trade shows costs of lead generation costs of computer and communications
equipment and support services facilities costs consulting fees and costs of
marketing programs such as internet television radio and print advertising

   a comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december
31 2001 2000 and 1999 is presented below

percentage of revenues       26              35             40


   the network solutions acquisition was the primary reason for the increase in
sales and marketing expenses in 2001 from 2000 as well as in 2000 as compared
to 1999 the mass markets division incurs expenses promoting the value of the
 com net and org web addresses as well as valueadded services including
web site design tools and other enhanced service offerings the remainder of
the increase in both periods was driven by lead and demand generation
activities in our enterprise and affiliate pki businesses expansion of our
sales force and an increase in international sales expenses the increase in
2000 from 1999 also reflects the effect of sales and marketing expenses from
thawte and signio

   while the absolute dollar spending increased for sales and marketing
expenses we continue to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a
percentage of revenues over the threeyear period this is primarily due to the
increase in recurring revenues from existing customers which tend to have
lower retention costs and the increase in the productivity of our direct and
inside sales forces however we cannot forecast that these sales and marketing
expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues

                                      51

page

   we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase on an
absolute dollar basis in the future primarily related to an expanded sales
force expanded marketing and demand generation activities development and
enhancement of partner and distribution channels and promotional activities for
web presence products and services

   research and development

   research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to
research and development personnel including salaries and other
personnelrelated expenses consulting fees and the costs of facilities
computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and
technology development

   a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended
december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 is presented below



                                 2001    change  2000    change  1999

       research and development 78134    89  41256   210  13303
       percentage of revenues       8              9             16


   research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in 2001 from
2000 and in 2000 from 1999 primarily due to the acquisition of network
solutions in june 2000 the increases in both periods relate to the development
and enhancement of new registry products related to multilingual domain names
and managed domain name system services in addition we continued to invest in
the design testing and deployment of and technical support for our expanded
digital trust service offerings and technology we also expanded our
engineering staff and incurred related costs required to support our continued
emphasis on developing new products and services as well as enhancing existing
products and services some of the new products and services developed during
2001 include our entitlement management services authentication service bureau
and digital trust services platform

   the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of
revenues in 2001 from 2000 and in 2000 from 1999 is largely due to the fact
that revenues increased faster than research and development expenses in these
periods we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of
revenues to decline in future periods

   we believe that timely development of new and enhanced enterprise services
payment services web presence services and other technologies are necessary to
maintain our position in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue to
recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other
investments in research and development as a result we expect research and
development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars to date we
have expensed all research and development expenditures as incurred

   general and administrative

   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other
personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance
and human resources personnel facilities and computer and communications
equipment management information systems support services professional
services fees and bad debt expense

      percentage of revenues       15             13            10


   the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2001 from 2000 and in
2000 over 1999 was primarily related to the acquisition of network solutions in
june 2000 expenses also increased in 2001 from 2000 as well as in 2000 from
1999 due to additional staffing levels required to manage and support our
expanded operations the implementation of additional management information
systems and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in addition our bad
debt expense increased to 269 million in 2001 from 58 million in 2000 and
9 million in 1999 primarily as a result of increased revenues and
deterioration in the overall economy in 2001

   the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
revenues in 2001 from 2000 and in 2000 from 1999 is primarily due to
incremental expenses related to integrating our acquisitions and different cost
structures of those acquisitions

   we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to
increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future as we expand our
administrative and executive staff add infrastructure expand facilities and
assimilate acquired technologies and businesses

   writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development

   the portion of the network solutions purchase price allocated to inprocess
research and development or iprd was 54 million and was expensed during the
quarter ended june 30 2000 network solutions iprd efforts focused on
significant and substantial improvements and upgrades to its shared
registration system or srs the srs is the system that provides a shared
registration interface to the icann accredited and licensed registrars into the
 com net and org top level domain or tld name registry it is through
this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain
names with the central database given the high demand on the srs it was in
need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability security
nonenglish language capability and next generation resource provisioning
protocol

   as of the acquisition date network solutions was in the process of
developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to
the srs the iprd had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses the technological feasibility of the inprocess development
efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all planning
designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that
the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications including
functions features and technical performance requirements the development
efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the srs and other systems were
completed in the first quarter of 2001

   the fair value assigned to iprd was estimated by discounting to present
value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it reached
technological feasibility a discount rate of 22 was used to estimate the
present value of cash flows the value assigned to iprd was the amount
attributable to the efforts of network solutions up to the time of acquisition
this amount was estimated through application of the stage of completion
calculation by multiplying the estimated present value of future cash flows

                                      53

excluding costs of completion by the percentage of completion of the purchased
research and development project at the time of acquisition

   amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangible assets

   during 2000 we completed several acquisitions including thawte signio and
network solutions these acquisitions resulted in the recording of goodwill and
other intangible assets in the amount of 213 billion our policy is to assess
the recoverability of goodwill using estimated undiscounted cash flows those
cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale of
an acquisition at the end of its goodwill amortization period though the
acquisitions have been predominantly performing at or above expectations
market conditions and attendant multiples used to estimate terminal values have
continued to remain depressed at june 30 2000 the nasdaq market index was at
3966 points and had decreased 1805 points or 46 to 2161 points at june
30 2001 this decline affected the analysis used to assess the recoverability
of goodwill for goodwill associated with thawte and network solutions fair
value was determined based on future operating cash flows over the remaining
amortization period of the goodwill the terminal values were estimated based
on the relationship of the value of the verisign stock issued at the
acquisition date to the value of verisigns stock over the threemonth period
preceding the valuation for signio and the other acquisitions fair value was
determined through the use of recent indicators of fair value such as
comparable sales and multiples derived from recent acquisition activities as a
result management recorded an impairment charge in the quarter ended june 30
2001 in the amount of 99 billion since the most significant acquisitions
were completed by issuing shares of our common stock the impairment should be
considered a noncash charge

   the amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangible assets was
approximately 136 billion in 2001 compared to 32 billion in 2000 in
addition to the 99 billion writedown discussed above the increase was
primarily related to our purchase acquisitions during 2000 which accounted for
approximately 213 billion of additional goodwill and other intangible assets
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill will no longer be
amortized to earnings commencing january 1 2002 instead goodwill will be
reviewed for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate that
an impairment may have occurred amortization of other intangible assets is
expected to be approximately 84 million per quarter thereafter including the
impact of all acquisitions through december 31 2001 but excluding the impact
of ho systems and assuming no other acquisitions or impairment charges

   other income expense net

   other income expense net consists primarily of interest earned on our
cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments gains and
losses on the sale or writedown of equity investments and the net effect of
foreign currency transaction gains and losses

   a comparison of other income for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and

   other expense net in 2001 was primarily comprised of the writedown of
investments totaling 891 million on certain public and nonpublic equity
security investments partially offset by 667 million of interest and other
income other income net in 2000 consisted primarily of a realized gain of
326 million from the sale of shares of keynote systems inc and interest
and other income of 536 million in 2001 we determined that the decline in
value of certain of our public and nonpublic equity securities investments was
other than temporary and we recorded a writedown of these investments totaling
891 million we had previously valued certain of these investments at the
thenfairmarket value as part of the network solutions acquisition we may
from time to time recognize losses or gains from the sales writedowns or
writeoffs of our equity investments our cash and investments base increased
significantly through the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000
however our invested balances produced lower returns due to lower market
interest rates in 2001 as compared to 2000

   the increase in 2000 from 1999 is primarily due to increased earnings on
funds invested investments increased in part due to our net proceeds of 1214
million generated from the followon public offering of our common stock in
january 1999 and the investment of cash generated from operations our
investment base was also significantly increased through the acquisition of
network solutions which added over 925 million of cash and investments in
2000 we also realized a 326 million gain from the sale of shares of keynote
systems inc

   income tax benefit

   in 2001 we recorded a 779 million tax benefit the benefit is due to the
realization of current net operating losses and certain current deferred tax
assets we have not provided a benefit for the longterm deferred tax assets
due to the uncertainty of their being realized as of december 31 2001 we had
federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 4924 million
related to stock compensation deductions we also had state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately 3138 million related to stock compensation
deductions we had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal or state
income tax purposes from operations if we are not able to use them the
federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2021 and
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2004 through 2021 in
addition we had available for carryover research and experimentation tax
credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately 89 million and for
state income tax purposes of approximately 52 million the federal research
and experimentation tax credits will expire if not utilized in 2010 through
2021 state research and experimental tax credits carry forward indefinitely
until utilized the tax reform act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on
the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a
corporations ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code our
ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result
of such ownership change we do not anticipate that any material limitation
exists on our ability to use our carryforwards and credits

   our accounting for deferred taxes under sfas no 109 accounting for income
taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the
realizability of our deferred tax assets in concluding that a valuation
allowance was required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets we
considered such factors as our history of operating losses our expected
current year taxable income exclusive of stock compensation deductions our
uncertainty as to the projected longterm operating results and the nature of
our deferred tax assets although our operating plans assume taxable and
operating income in future periods our evaluation of all of the available
evidence in assessing the realizability of the noncurrent deferred tax assets
indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the
available negative evidence the possible future reversal of the valuation
allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the
valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through
ongoing operations to the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred
tax assets generated through

                                      55

stock compensation deductions the possible future reversal of such valuation
allowance will result in a credit to additional paid in capital and will not
result in future income statement benefit see note 10 of notes to consolidated
financial statements

   minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary

   minority interest in the net income loss of verisign japan kk was 6
million in 2001 13 million in 2000 and 8 million in 1999 the
yeartoyear changes are primarily due to verisign japans increased revenues
as compared to the prior years as the verisign japan business continues to
develop and evolve we expect that the minority interest in net income loss
of subsidiary will fluctuate

we disclose pro forma financial information

   we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also
disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related
earnings release and investor conference call our pro forma financial
information does not include the amortization and writedown of goodwill and
intangible assets related to acquisitions stockbased compensation charges
related to acquisitions writedown of investments and benefit for income
taxes we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps
investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations
however we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information
included as part of our quarterly reports on form 10q our annual reports on
form 10k and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial
information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly

   at december 31 2001 our principal source of liquidity was 7267 million
of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisting principally of
commercial paper medium term corporate notes corporate bonds and notes
market auction securities us government and agency securities and money
market funds in addition we hold 2018 million of longterm investments
consisting primarily of debt and equity securities of nonpublic companies
which have no ready market

   net cash provided by operating activities was 2275 million in 2001 1920
million in 2000 and 147 million in 1999 the increase was primarily due to an
overall increase in net income after adjustments for noncash items such as
amortization and the writedown of goodwill and other intangible assets
depreciation of property and equipment and the writedown of certain
investments as well as higher levels of deferred revenue the increase in cash
provided by operating activities was partially offset by increases in deferred
income taxes and accounts receivable

   net cash used in investing activities was 3891 million in 2001 primarily
as a result of 13 billion used for purchases of investments which were
offset by proceeds of 14 billion from sales and maturities of investments
3803 million used for purchases of property and equipment including
approximately 285 million used for the purchase of the land and buildings for
our corporate headquarters in california and 526 million paid net of cash
acquired for business combinations net cash provided by investing activities
was 1240 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the cash acquired in our
acquisitions partially

offset by increased purchases of short and longterm investments and costs
relating to our acquisitions in 1999 net cash used in investing activities of
1032 million was primarily related to net purchases of investments capital
expenditures for property and equipment totaled 3803 million in 2001 588
million in 2000 and 60 million in 1999 our planned capital expenditures for
2002 are approximately 140 million to 150 million primarily for computer and
communications equipment and leasehold improvements as of december 31 2001
we also had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities
for various terms through 2011 see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial
statements

   net cash provided by financing activities was 108 million in 2001 735
million in 2000 and 1362 million in 1999 in 2001 and 2000 cash was provided
primarily from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises in
2001 these proceeds were partially offset by the use of approximately 70
million to repurchase shares of our common stock in 1999 we received net cash
proceeds of 1214 million from the public offering of our stock

   in april 2001 the board authorized the use of up to 350 million to
repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or
block trades during 2001 we repurchased approximately 1650000 shares at a
cost of approximately 70 million at december 31 2001 approximately
280 million remained available for future purchases under this program

   we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments
and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months an increase
in the number of significant acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash
may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing
strategic relationships or other arrangements this additional funding if
needed might not be available on terms attractive to us or at all failure to
raise capital when needed could materially harm our business if we raise
additional funds through the issuance of equity securities the percentage of
our stock owned by our thencurrent stockholders will be reduced furthermore
these equity securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to
those of our common stock

   our illuminet subsidiary entered into an agreement with bank of america
effective june 1 2000 to provide a line of credit and a capital expenditure
loan facility the line of credit is a 100 million unsecured loan that
expires june 1 2002 with a oneyear extension available the capital
expenditure loan facility is a 15 million unsecured loan with a fiveyear
term no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit and 800000 was
outstanding under the capital expenditure facility at december 31 2001
amounts drawn under these agreements must be made by illuminet we currently
have no plans to make any borrowings under this agreement

   in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities
and exchange commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common
stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices with a
total public offering price not to exceed 750 million to date no shares have
been issued under this registration statement

   in december 2001 we signed a master contract with ibm under which we
committed to purchase 30 million of ibm technology over the next three years

   in february 2002 we completed our acquisition of ho systems inc a
provider of billing and customer care solutions to wireless carriers we used
approximately 350 million in cash for this acquisition

recently issued accounting pronouncements

   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas
no 141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets

   sfas no 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for under
the purchase method for business combinations initiated after june 30 2001
use of the poolingofinterests method is no longer permitted we adopted the
provisions of sfas no 141 commencing july 1 2001 we have accounted for all
of our business combinations in 2001 and 2000 as purchases and the adoption of
sfas no 141 is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial
position or results of operations

   sfas no 142 requires that goodwill resulting from a business combination
will no longer be amortized to earnings but instead be reviewed for
impairment we are required to adopt sfas no 142 as of january 1 2002 for
goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to july 1 2001
amortization of goodwill continued through december 31 2001 but ceased
commencing january 1 2002 for business combinations occurring on or after
july 1 2001 the associated goodwill will not be amortized upon adoption of
sfas no 142 we are required to perform a transitional impairment test for all
recorded goodwill within six months and if necessary determine the amount of
an impairment loss by december 31 2002 the adoption of sfas no 142 will
reduce the amount of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets from
approximately 460 million per quarter to approximately 84 million per
quarter including the effect of all acquisitions through december 31 2001
but excluding the impact of ho systems and assuming no other acquisitions or
impairment charges in addition approximately 109 million of intangible
assets previously allocated to workforce in place will be subsumed into
goodwill as of january 1 2002 we are currently evaluating the effect if any
of the required impairment testing on our recorded goodwill which had a net
book value of 49 billion at december 31 2001

   in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations and in october issued sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 143 requires that the
fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded as a liability in the
period in which the obligation is incurred sfas no 144 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
and supercedes sfas no 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb
opinion no 30 as it related to the disposal of a segment of a business
sfas no 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 and
sfas no 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001
we have adopted sfas no 144 effective january 1 2002 and sfas no 143 will be
adopted effective january 1 2003 the effect of adopting these statements is
not expected to have a material effect on ours consolidated financial position
or results of operations



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate sensitivity

   the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal
while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments
without significantly increasing risk some of the securities that we have
invested in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in
prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to
fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed
interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate
later rises the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in
value if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by
10 percent from levels at december 31 2001 this would not materially change
the fair market value of our portfolio to minimize this risk we maintain our
portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of
securities including commercial paper mediumterm notes corporate bonds and
notes market auction securities us government and

                                      58

agency securities and money market funds in general money market funds are
not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds
fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate in addition we generally invest
in relatively shortterm securities as of december 31 2001 43 of our
shortterm investments mature in less than one year

   we do not hold any derivative financial instruments

   the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and
investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and
weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2001 this table does not
include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk

exchange rate sensitivity

   we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to
be minimal all revenues derived from operations other than verisign japan
kk thawte south africa registrarscom canada euro909 europe and
domainnamescom uk are denominated in united states dollars and therefore
are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations

   both the revenues and expenses of our majorityowned subsidiary in japan as
well as our wholly owned subsidiaries and sales offices in south africa
europe sweden canada and the united kingdom are denominated in local
currencies in these regions we believe this serves as a natural hedge against
exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the
exchange rate of the foreign currency against the united states dollar will
result in lower revenues when translated to united states dollars operating
expenses will also be lower in these circumstances because of our minimal
exposure to foreign currencies we have not engaged in any hedging activities
although if future events or changes in circumstances indicate that hedging
activities would be beneficial we may consider such activities

equity price risk

   we own shares of common stock of several public companies we value these
investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month
these investments are subject to market price volatility we reflect these
investments on our balance sheet at their market value with the unrealized
gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the accumulated other
comprehensive income component of stockholders equity we have also invested
in equity instruments of several privately held companies many of which can
still be considered in the startup or development stages and therefore carry
a high level of risk in 2001 we determined the decline in value of certain
public and nonpublic equity investments was other than temporary and we
recognized a 891 million impairment loss due to the inherent risk associated
with some of our investments and in light of current stock market conditions
we may incur future losses on the sales writedowns or writeoffs of our
investments we do not currently hedge against equity price changes

note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies

   business

   verisign inc a delaware corporation is a leading provider of digital
trust services that enable web site owners enterprises communications service
providers electronic commerce service providers and individuals to engage in
secure digital commerce and communications verisigns digital trust services
include three core offerings managed security and network services registry

services provide the critical web identity authentication and transaction
infrastructure that online businesses need to establish their web identities

   consolidation

   the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
verisign and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions as of december 31 2001 verisign owned approximately 677 of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of its subsidiary verisign japan kk
the minority interest in verisign japan kk is included in other longterm
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets changes in
verisigns proportionate share of the net assets of verisign japan resulting
from sales of capital stock by the subsidiary are accounted for as equity
transactions

   use of estimates

   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

   cash cash equivalents and investments

   verisign considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents cash and cash
equivalents include money market funds commercial paper and various deposit
accounts

   verisigns investments in marketable securities are classified as
availableforsale and are carried at fair value based on quoted market
prices these investments consist primarily of us government and agency
securities corporate bonds and notes municipal bonds assetbacked securities
and mediumterm notes verisign has the intent to maintain a liquid portfolio
and has the ability to redeem its investments at their carrying amounts
therefore all marketable investments at december 31 2001 have been classified
as shortterm investments previously investments with original maturities
greater than twelve months at the time of purchase were classified as longterm
investments because verisigns intent was to hold these investments for more
than one year verisigns investments in debt and equity securities of
nonpublic

companies are classified as longterm investments realized gains and losses
upon sale or maturity of investments are determined using the specific
identification method

   verisign invests in debt and equity securities of technology companies for
business and strategic purposes investments in public companies are classified
as availableforsale and are carried at fair value based on quoted market
prices verisign reviews its marketable equity holdings in publiclytraded
companies on a regular basis to determine if any security has experienced an
otherthantemporary decline in fair value verisign considers the investee
companys cash position earnings and revenue outlook stock price performance
over the past six months liquidity and management ownership among other
factors in its review if it is determined that an otherthantemporary
decline exists in a marketable equity security verisign writes down the
investment to its market value and records the related writedown as an
investment loss in its consolidated statements of operations investments in
nonpublic companies are accounted for under the cost method for these
nonquoted investments verisign regularly reviews the assumptions underlying
the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information
requested from these privately held companies generally this information may
be more limited may not be as timely and may be less accurate than information
available from publicly traded companies assessing each investments carrying
value requires significant judgment by management if it is determined that an
otherthantemporary decline exists in a nonpublic equity security verisign
writes down the investment to its fair value and records the related writedown
as an investment loss in its consolidated statements of operations generally
if cash balances are insufficient to sustain the investees operations for a
sixmonth period we consider the decline in fair value to be other than
temporary during 2001 verisign determined that the decline in value of
certain of its public and nonpublic equity investments was other than
temporary and recorded a writedown of these investments totaling 891 million

   from time to time verisign may recognize revenues from companies in which
it also has made an investment in addition to its normal revenue recognition
policies verisign also considers the amount of other thirdparty investments
in the company its earnings and revenue outlook and its operational
performance in determining the propriety and amount of revenues to recognize
if the investment is made in the same quarter that revenues are recognized
verisign looks to the investments of other third parties made at that time to
establish the fair value of verisigns investment in the company as well as to
support the amount of revenues recognized verisign typically makes its
investments with others where its investment is less than 50 of the total
financing round verisigns policy is not to recognize revenue in excess of
other investors financing of the company

   property and equipment

   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets 40 years for buildings and three to five years for
computer equipment purchased software office equipment and furniture and
fixtures leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method
over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or remaining lease
terms

available for general release concurrent with the establishment of
technological feasibility and accordingly no such costs have been capitalized

   software included in property and equipment includes amounts paid for
purchased software and implementation services for software used internally
that has been capitalized in accordance with the american institute of
certified public accountants statement of position sop no 981 in 2001
verisign capitalized 80 million of implementation and consulting services
from third parties for software that is used internally no costs related to
internally developed software have been capitalized

   foreign currency translation

   the functional currency for substantially all of verisigns international
subsidiaries is the us dollar however the subsidiaries books of record are
maintained in local currency as a result the subsidiaries financial
statements are remeasured into us dollars using a combination of current and
historical exchange rates and any transaction gains and losses which have not
been significant are included in operating results

   the financial statements of the subsidiaries for which the local currency is
the functional currency are translated into us dollars using the current rate
for assets and liabilities and a weighted average rate for the period for
revenues and expenses the cumulative translation adjustment that results from
this translation is included in accumulated other comprehensive income

   revenue recognition

   verisign derives revenues from three primary categories web presence and
trust services which include domain name registration services web trust
services and payment services managed security and network services which
include enterprise and affiliate pki services and enterprise consulting
services and registry and telecommunications services which include registry
services connectivity intelligent network wireless and clearinghouse
services the revenue recognition policy for each of these areas is as follows

   domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees
charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services
revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name registration services are
deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term generally one to
two years and up to 10 years

   domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on
recent renewal and collection rates customers are notified of the expiration
of their registration in advance and verisign

records the receivables for estimated renewal fees in the month preceding the
anniversary date of their registration when it has a right to bill under the
terms of domain name registration agreements the variance between the actual
collections and the rate used to estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the
setting of prospective renewal rates fees for renewals and advance extensions
to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences
these fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term ranging
from one to ten years

   revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business
process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements
including postcontract customer support training and other services these
licenses which do not provide for right of return are primarily perpetual
licenses for which revenues are recognized up front once all criteria for
revenue recognition have been met

   revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and
recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate generally 12
months revenues from the sale of onsite managed services are deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of the license generally 12 to 36 months
maintenance is bundled with onsite licenses over the license term

   verisign recognizes revenues from issuances of digital certificates and
business process licensing to verisign affiliates in accordance with sop 972
software revenue recognition as amended by sop 989 and generally
recognizes revenues when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in
paragraph 8 of sop 972 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2
delivery has occurred 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4
collectibility is probable verisign defines each of these four criteria as
follows

   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  it is verisigns customary
practice to have a written contract which is signed by both the customer and
verisign or a purchase order from those customers who have previously
negotiated a standard license arrangement with verisign

   delivery has occurred  verisigns software may be either physically or
electronically delivered to the customer electronic delivery is deemed to have
occurred upon download by the customer from an ftp server if an arrangement
includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the
functionality of the delivered product delivery is not considered to have
occurred until these products or services are delivered

   the fee is fixed or determinable  verisigns policy is to not provide
customers the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees paid
verisign may agree to extended payment terms with a foreign customer based on
local customs generally at least 80 of the arrangement fees are due within
one year or less arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these
customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable and
revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and
payable

   collectibility is probable  collectibility is assessed on a
customerbycustomer basis verisign typically sells to customers for whom
there is a history of successful collection new customers are subjected to a
credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and
ultimately their ability to pay if it is determined from the outset of an
arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon verisigns credit
review process revenues are recognized as cash is collected

   verisign allocates revenues on software arrangements involving multiple
elements to each element based on the relative fair values of each element
verisigns determination of fair value of each element in multiple element
arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe verisign
limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the
same element is sold separately verisign has analyzed all of the elements
included in its multipleelement arrangements and determined that it has
sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to maintenance and support service
professional services and training components of its perpetual license
arrangements verisign sells its professional services and training separately
and has established vsoe on this basis vsoe for maintenance and support is
determined based upon the customers annual renewal rates for these elements
accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenues
from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method
in accordance with sop 989 verisign recognizes revenues from licenses in
which maintenance is bundled with the software license such as for digital
certificates digital certificate provisioning and onsite managed services
ratably over the license term of one to three years

   verisigns consulting services generally are not essential to the
functionality of the software verisigns software products are fully
functional upon delivery and implementation and do not require any significant
modification or alteration customers purchase these consulting services to
facilitate the adoption of verisigns technology and dedicate personnel to
participate in the services being performed but they may also decide to use
their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to
provide these services software products are billed separately and
independently from consulting services which are generally billed on a
timeandmaterials or milestoneachieved basis verisign generally recognizes
revenues from consulting services as the services are performed

   revenues from consulting and training services are recognized using the
percentageofcompletion method for fixedfee development arrangements or as
the services are provided for timeandmaterials arrangements revenues from
thirdparty product sales are recognized when title to the products sold passes
to the customer verisigns shipping terms generally dictate that the passage
of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the customer

   revenues from payment services primarily consist of a setup fee and a
monthly service fee for the transaction processing services in accordance with
sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in
financial statements revenues from the setup fee are deferred and recognized
ratably over the period that the fees are earned revenues from the service
fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are
provided advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably
to revenue over the periods the services are provided

   revenues from network services are comprised of network connectivity
revenues and intelligent network services revenues network connectivity
revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to verisigns
ss7 network and trunk signaling services revenues from network connectivity
consist primarily of monthly recurring fees and trunk signaling service
revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a
customer signals the initial connection fee and related costs are deferred and
recognized over the term of the arrangement intelligent network services

wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services

   clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a
distribution and collection point for billing information and payment
collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another
clearinghouse revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed

   on occasion verisign has purchased goods or services for its operations
from organizations such as ibm oracle phoenix technologies and infospace at
or about the same time that it licensed its software to these organizations
these transactions are recorded at terms verisign considers to be fair value
for these reciprocal arrangements verisign considers accounting principles
board abp opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions and
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0102 interpretation of apb
opinion no 29 to determine whether the arrangement is a monetary or
nonmonetary transaction transactions involving the exchange of boot
representing 25 or greater of the fair value of the reciprocal arrangement are
considered monetary transactions within the context of apb opinion no 29 and
eitf issue no 0102 monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions that
represent the culmination of an earnings process are recorded at the fair value
of the products delivered or products or services received whichever is more
readily determinable providing the fair values are determinable within
reasonable limits in determining the fair values verisign considers the
recent history of cash sales of the same products or services in similar sized
transactions revenues from such transactions may be recognized over a period
of time as the products or services are received for nonmonetary reciprocal
arrangements that do not represent the culmination of the earnings process the
exchange is recorded based on the carrying value of the products delivered
which is generally zero

   revenues recognized under reciprocal arrangements were approximately 375
million in 2001 of which 270 million involved nonmonetary transactions as
defined above verisign did not recognize any revenues under reciprocal
arrangements in 2000 and 1999

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax

cash cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities with high
quality financial institutions and as part of its cash management process
performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these
financial institutions in addition the portfolio of investments in marketable
securities conforms to verisigns policy regarding concentration of
investments maximum maturity and quality of investment concentration of
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited by the diversity of
the customer base and geographic dispersion verisign also performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and generally requires no collateral

   impairment of longlived assets

intangible assets and property and equipment verisign reviews longlived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable such events or
circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the
fair value of the underlying business a significant decrease in the benefits
realized from the acquired business difficulties or delays in integrating the
business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business

carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are
expected to generate those cash flows include an

the provisions of sfas no 141 commencing july 1 2001 verisign has accounted
for all of its business combinations in 2001 and 2000 as purchases and the
adoption of sfas no 141 is not expected to have a significant impact on its
financial position or results of operations

   sfas no 142 requires that goodwill resulting from a business combination
will no longer be amortized to earnings but instead be reviewed for
impairment verisign is required to adopt sfas no 142 as of january 1 2002
for goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to july 1 2001
amortization of goodwill continued through december 31 2001 but ceased

july 1 2001 the associated goodwill will not be amortized upon adoption of
sfas no 142 verisign is required to perform a transitional impairment test
for all recorded goodwill within six months and if necessary determine the
amount of an impairment loss by december 31 2002 the adoption of sfas no 142
will reduce the amount of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets from

   as of the acquisition date network solutions was in the process of
developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to
the srs the iprd had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses the technological feasibility of the inprocess development
efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all planning
designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that
the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications including
functions features and technical performance requirements the development
efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the srs were completed during
the first quarter of 2001

   the fair value assigned to iprd was estimated by discounting to present
value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached
technological feasibility a discount rate of 22 was used to estimate the
present value of cash flows which was consistent with the risk of the project
the value assigned to iprd was the amount attributable to the efforts of the
seller up to the time of acquisition this amount was estimated through
application of the stage of completion calculation by multiplying the
estimated present value of future cash flows excluding costs of completion by
the percentage of completion of the purchased research and development project
at the time of acquisition

   other acquisitions

stock of these companies verisign also assumed outstanding stock options for
certain of these acquisitions in addition verisign escrowed shares of common

two year period of required employment verisign also recorded a provision for
merger related costs of 42 million for employee severance relocation and
write down of duplicative systems each of the acquisitions has been accounted

approximately 1202 million has been allocated to the tangible and intangible
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values on the acquisition dates the acquired companies results of operations

affected the analysis used to assess the recoverability of goodwill for
goodwill associated with thawte and network solutions fair value was
determined based on future operating cash flows over the remaining amortization
period of the goodwill the terminal values were estimated based on the
relationship of the value of the verisign stock issued at the acquisition date
to the value of verisigns stock over the threemonth period preceding the
valuation for signio and the other acquisitions fair value was determined
through the use of recent indicators of fair value such as comparable sales and
multiples derived from recent acquisition activities as a result management
recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter of 2001 totaling 99
billion since the most significant acquisitions were completed by issuing
shares of verisigns common stock the impairment should be considered a
noncash charge

   the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the second quarter
of 2001 resulted in a writeoff of the net book value as follows

   in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax
assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which temporary differences become deductible management does not believe it
is more likely than not that the

codm views and evaluates verisigns operations verisigns chief executive
officer has been identified as the codm as defined by sfas no 131
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information other
factors including customer base homogeneity of products technology and
delivery channels were also considered in determining the reportable segments
the performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics including
gross margin

   the mass markets division provides domain name registration digital
certificate and payment services and other valueadded services to small and
medium sized companies as well as to individual consumers the enterprise and
service provider division provides products and services to organizations that
want to establish and deliver internetbased and telecommunicationsbased
services for their customers in both businesstoconsumer and
businesstobusiness environments in 2000 verisigns results prior to its
acquisition of network solutions are included in the enterprise and service
provider division

   in 1999 verisign operated in a single reportable segment and derived
substantially all of its revenues from sales of internetbased trust services

   the accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are
generally the same as those described in note 1 description of business and
summary of significant accounting policies

   the following table reflects the results of verisigns reportable segments
under verisigns management system the other segment consists primarily of
unallocated corporate expenses these results are used in part by the codm
and by management in evaluating the performance of and in allocating
resources to each of the segments internal revenues and segment gross margin
include transactions between segments that are intended to reflect an arms
length transfer at the best price available for comparable external
transactions

  reinstated within 24 hours of a failure in addition all of our digital
  certificate services are linked to advanced storage systems that provide
  data protection through techniques such as mirroring and replication we
  also contract for a backup facility to a third partys secure facility in
  california to provide redundancy and enhanced reliability for our internet

marketing sales and distribution

   we market our services worldwide through multiple distribution channels
including the internet direct sales telesales valueadded resellers systems
integrators and our international affiliates a significant portion of our
revenues to date have been generated through sales from our website but we
intend to continue increasing our direct sales force both in the united states
and abroad and to continue to expand our other distribution channels

   our direct sales and marketing organization at december 31 2000 consisted
of approximately 500 individuals including managers sales representatives and
technical support personnel we have field sales offices globally providing
coverage throughout the world additionally our sales are currently being made
through multiple channels including wholesale and retail distributors
resellers and direct sales throughout the world

   we continue to build an international network of affiliates who provide our
trust services under licensed cobranding relationships using our proprietary
technology and business practices the verisign trust network now consists of
approximately 35 organizations including arabtrust in the middle east british
telecommunications plc in the united kingdom canadian imperial bank of
commerce of canada certisur of argentina certplus of france esign of
australia hitrust of taiwan kpn telecom of the netherlands roccade of the
netherlands the south african certification agency in south africa and telia
in sweden these international service providers utilize common technology
operating practices and infrastructure to deliver interoperable trust services
for a specific geographic region or vertical market

   the verisign customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry
and in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted
for 10 percent or more of our net sales

research and development

   as of december 31 2000 verisign had 228 employees dedicated to research
and development research and development expenses were 413 million in 2000
133 million in 1999 and 84 million in 1998 to date all development costs
have been expensed as incurred we believe that timely development of new and
enhanced internetbased trust services and technology are necessary to remain
competitive in the marketplace accordingly we intend to continue recruiting
and hiring experienced research and development personnel and to make
additional investments in research and development

   we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability
to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies internetbased
trust services and registration services to this end we leverage the modular
nature of our worldtrust platform to enable us to develop enhancements rapidly
and to deliver complementary new internetbased trust services in the past we
have developed internetbased trust services both independently and through
efforts with leading application developers and major customers we have also
in certain circumstances acquired or licensed technology from third parties
including public key cryptography technology from rsa although we will
continue to work closely with developers and major customers in our development
efforts we expect that most of our future enhancements to existing services
and new internetbased trust services will be developed internally

   the markets for internetbased trust services and web identity services are
emerging markets characterized by rapid technological developments frequent
new product introductions and evolving industry standards the emerging nature
of these markets and their rapid evolution will require that we continually
improve the performance features and reliability of our internetbased trust
services and web identity services particularly in response to competitive
offerings and that we introduce both new and enhanced internetbased trust
services and web identity services as quickly as possible and prior to our
competitors

competition

   competition in internet trust services our internetbased trust services
are targeted at the new and rapidly evolving market for trusted services
including authentication validation and payment that enable secure electronic
commerce and communications over wired and wireless ip networks although the
competitive environment in this market has yet to develop fully we anticipate
that it will be intensely competitive subject to rapid change and
significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other
market activities of industry participants

   our principal competitors generally fall within one of three categories 1
companies such as baltimore technologies certicom corp diversinet corp and
entrust technologies which offer software applications and related digital
certificate products that customers operate themselves 2 companies such as
digital signature trust company a subsidiary of zions bancorporation that
primarily offer digital certificate and certificate authority or ca related
services and 3 companies focused on providing a bundled offering of products
and services such as gte cybertrust recently acquired by baltimore
technologies and ibm working jointly with equifax we also experience
competition from a number of smaller companies and we believe that our primary
longterm competitors may not yet have entered the market furthermore
netscape and microsoft have introduced software products that enable the
issuance and management of digital certificates and we believe that other
companies could introduce such products additional companies could offer
digital certificate solutions that are competitive with ours

   in addition browser companies that embed our interface technologies or
otherwise feature us as a provider of digital certificate products and services
in their web browsers or on their websites could also promote our competitors
or charge us substantial fees for promotions in the future new technologies
and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive
pressures on us we can not assure you that competing technologies developed by
others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our
competitive position or render our internetbased trust services or
technologies noncompetitive or obsolete in addition the market for digital
certificates is emerging and is characterized by announcements of collaborative
relationships involving our competitors the existence or announcement of any
relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain
customers as a result of the foregoing and other factors we may not be able
to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive
pressures that we face could materially harm our business

   in connection with our first round of financing rsa contributed certain
technology to us and entered into a noncompetition agreement with us under
which rsa agreed that it would not compete with our ca business for a period of
five years this noncompetition agreement expired in april 2000 we believe
that because rsa which is now a whollyowned subsidiary of rsa security has
already developed expertise in the area of cryptography its barriers to entry
would be lower than those that would be encountered by our other potential
competitors should rsa choose to enter any of our markets if rsa were to enter
into the digital certificate market our business could be materially harmed

   competition in web presence services we currently face competition among
registrars within a single top level domain like com and in the future face
competition among registrars within all new top level domains as of february
28 2001 there were over 140 icannaccredited registrars including us
america online bulkregistercom core or council of internet registrars
deutsche telekom france telecomtranspac idirections internet domain
registars interq incorporated melbourne it namesecurecom netbenefit
psinet registercom tucowscom inc talkcom and verio as of february 28
2001 our shared registration system was being used by 77 accredited
registrars in addition to us in the com net and org top level domains to
register second level domain names we also face competition from third level
domain name providers such as internet access providers and registrars of top
level domains other than those top level domains for which we act as exclusive
registry although we currently act as the exclusive registry for second level
domain names within the com net and org top level domains we face
competition from registries of country code top level domains and from new top
level domains

                                       10
page

   the process to introduce new top level domains is currently in progress on
november 16 2000 icann announced its selections for registry operators for
seven new top level domains the applicants selected for further negotiation
are the following

      aerosociete internationale de telecommunications aeronautiques sc

      bizjvteam llc

      coopnational cooperative business association

      infoafilias llc

      museummuseum domain management association

      nameglobal name registry ltd and

      proregistrypro ltd

   as a result we could have additional competition

   competition in internet technology consulting services companies with
internet expertise are current or potential competitors to our internet
technology services these companies include systems integrators and consulting
firms such as accenture formerly andersen consulting ibm global services and
lucent netcare we also compete with some companies that have developed
products that automate the management of internet protocol addresses and name
maps throughout enterprisewide intranets and with companies with internally
developed systems integration efforts

   several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other
resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we
can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer
requirements many of these competitors also have broader and more established
distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or
services directly to customers through bundling or other means if such
competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers
the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and our
ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our
services would be substantially diminished

industry regulation

   export exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are
generally restricted by the us and various foreign governments although we
have obtained us government approval to export our global server digital
certificates and none of our other internetbased trust services are currently
subject to export controls under us law the list of products and countries
for which export approval is required could be revised in the future to include
more digital certificate products and related services and more countries if
we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell certain
internetbased trust services in international markets

   internet commerce there are currently no federal laws or regulations that
specifically control certification authorities or cas but a limited number of
states have enacted legislation or regulations with respect to cas if the
market for digital certificates grows the us federal or state or foreign
governments may choose to enact further regulations governing cas or other
providers of digital certificate products and related services regulations or
the costs of complying with these regulations could harm our business

   many companies conducting electronic commerce over ip networks do not
collect sales or other similar taxes with respect to shipments of goods into
other states or foreign countries or with respect to other transactions
conducted between parties in different states or countries it is possible that
the us federal or state or foreign governments may seek to impose sales taxes
on companies that engage in electronic commerce

                                       11
page

over ip networks in the event that government bodies succeed in imposing sales
or other taxes on electronic commerce the growth of the use of ip networks for
electronic commerce could slow substantially which could materially harm our
business

   due to the increasing popularity of ip networks it is possible that
domestic or foreign laws and regulations may be enacted covering issues such as
user privacy information handling practices consumer protection and the
pricing content and quality of products and services the increased attention
focused upon these issues as a result of the adoption of other laws or
regulations may reduce the rate of growth of ip networks which in turn could
result in decreased demand for our internetbased trust services or could
otherwise materially harm our business

   domain name registration the cooperative agreement which network solutions
entered into with the national science foundation in december 1992 provided
that we would perform internet domain name registration services for the top
level domains com net org edu and gov  these registration services
included the initial twoyear domain name registration and annual re
registration and throughout the registration term maintenance of and
unlimited modifications to individual domain name records and updates to the
master file of domain names the cooperative agreement became effective january
1 1993 effective september 9 1998 the department of commerce took over the
administration of the cooperative agreement from the national science
foundation

   with the onset of increased commercial growth of the internet the us
government initiated activity directed at increased privatization of the
policymaking and central administration of the internet within the us
government leadership for the continued privatization of internet
administration is currently provided by the department of commerce on june 10
1998 the department of commerce published in the federal register a plan
referred to as the statement of policy calling for increased competition and
the formation of a corporation to assume certain responsibilities relating to
the domain name system

   the process initiated by the statement of policy resulted in the entry by
the us government into a memorandum of understanding or mou with icann a
usbased private notforprofit corporation with an international board of
directors the us government has recognized icann as the corporation
described in amendment 11 to our december 1992 cooperative agreement in the
performance of icanns obligations under the mou and until such time as the
mou is terminated

   currently the technical structure of the internet only permits one registry
for each toplevel domain a registrar acts as the interface between the
registry and the enduser domain name registrants registrars submit to the
registry certain limited information for each of their customers that has a
secondlevel domain name in a given top level domain a registrar can provide
valueadded products and services in addition to its basic registration
service numerous registrars are able to operate within each toplevel domain
we currently are the exclusive registry in the com net and org toplevel
domains and the leading registrar in those domains

   on november 10 1999 a series of wideranging agreements were entered into
these agreements include the following

    a registry agreement between us and icann under which we will continue
     to act as the exclusive registry for the com net and org top level
     domains for at least four years from that date

    a revised registrar accreditation agreement between icann and all
     registrars registering names in the com net and org domains

    a revised registrar license and agreement between us as registry and all
     registrars registering names in the com net and org domains using
     our proprietary shared registration system

    an amendment to the cooperative agreement and

    an amendment to the mou

                                       12
page

   under these agreements we have i recognized icann as the notforprofit
corporation described in amendment 11 to the cooperative agreement ii become
an icannaccredited registrar and iii agreed to operate the registry in
accordance with the provisions of the registry agreement and the consensus
policies established by icann in accordance with the terms of that agreement
these agreements provide that we will be an accredited registrar through
november 9 2004 with a right to renew indefinitely in accordance with the
agreement

   we have implemented modifications to the shared registration system that
enable a registrar to a accept registrations and reregistrations in oneyear
increments and b add one year to a registrants registration period upon
transfer of a registration from one registrar to another the unexpired term of
any registration may not exceed ten years we are contractually obligated to
provide equivalent access to the shared registration system to all icann
accredited registrars and to ensure that the revenues and assets of the
registry are not utilized to advantage our registrar to the detriment of other
registrars we have agreed to and implemented an organizational conflict of
interest compliance plan that includes organizational physical and procedural
safeguards in connection with these obligations

   the term of the registry agreement extends until november 9 2003 except
that in the event that we complete the legal separation of the ownership of our
registry business from our registrar business by divesting all the assets and
operations of one of those businesses by may 9 2001 to an unaffiliated third
party that enters an agreement enforceable by icann and the department of
commerce 1 not to be both a registry and a registrar in the com net and
 org toplevel domains and 2 not to control own or have as an affiliate any
individuals or entityies that collectively act as both a registry and a
registrar in the com net and org toplevel domains the term will be
extended for an additional four years resulting in a total term of eight
years for the purposes of this provision unaffiliated third party means any
entity in which we including our successors and assignees subsidiaries and
divisions and their respective directors officers employees agents and
representatives do not have majority equity ownership or the ability to
exercise managerial or operational control either directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries control as used in this provision means
any of the following 1 ownership directly or indirectly or other interest
entitling us to exercise in the aggregate 25 or more of the voting power of an
entity 2 the power directly or indirectly to elect 25 or more of the
board of directors or equivalent governing body of an entity or 3 the
ability directly or indirectly to direct or cause the direction of the
management operations or policies of an entity department of commerce
approval would be required for the transfer of our registry operations and for
the designation of a successor registry by icann upon expiration of the
agreement icann will conduct a process for selecting a successor registry in
which case we may compete on an equal basis if during the term of the
agreement we fail to remedy any breach by us of the agreement we may be
terminated as the registry for the com net and org top level domains

   icann is contractually obligated to the registry and to all accredited
registrars to comply with specified procedural requirements governing the
exercise of its authority the agreements also explicitly define the subjects
within the scope of icanns authority with respect to both the registry and
registrars icanns authority to set policy for the registry may be terminated
if a icann breaches the registry agreement and fails to remedy that breach
b the department of commerce withdraws its recognition of icann or c the
department of commerce concludes that icann has not made sufficient progress
towards entering into agreements with other registries and we are competitively
disadvantaged in the event icanns authority is terminated the department of
commerce will assume the policysetting function for registry services for the
 com net and org top level domains

   we have agreed to pay annual fees to icann as set by icann at levels
currently not to exceed 2 million for our registrar and 250000 for our
registry we have agreed to provide to the department of commerce control over
the content and use of the internicnet website subject to transition
arrangements set forth in the agreements

   all accredited registrars are obligated to provide querybased access to
registration data and are barred from placing conditions upon any legal use of
that data except to prohibit use of the data to enable the

                                       13
page

transmission of mass unsolicited commercial solicitations via email spam or
to enable high volume automated electronic processes that apply to the
registrar or its systems in addition all accredited registrars are required
to provide thirdparty bulk access to registration data subject to the
restrictions described above for an annual fee not to exceed 10000 this
obligation would remain in effect until replaced by a different policy adopted
by icann or a finding by the department of commerce that no individual or
entity is able to exercise market power with respect to data used for
development of thirdparty valueadded products and services

   on october 24 1999 icann adopted the uniform domain name dispute
resolution policy commonly known as the dispute policy and accompanying rules
of procedure required to be used by all accredited registrars in the com net
and org top level domains we implemented this policy on january 1 2000
registrars do not participate in the administration or conduct of any
proceeding brought under the dispute policy each registrant agrees in its
contract with a registrar to be bound by the terms and conditions found in the
dispute policy if a complaint is brought by a trademark owner under the
dispute policy and the trademark owner prevails the registrar is required
under the dispute policy to implement the decision within ten days after being
notified of a decision the registrant can suspend implementation of the
decision by filing suit against the trademark owner within that tenday period

   on november 29 1999 the anticybersquatting consumer protection act was
signed into law by the president making it illegal under certain circumstances
for persons to register domain names which conflict with personal names or
trademarks the remedies under this act are forfeiture cancellation and
transfer of the domain name registration to the trademark owner or the
individual except in cases of bad faith reckless disregard or willful failure
to comply with a court order the registry and registrar are not liable for
injunctive or monetary relief as long as the registry and registrar comply with
the procedural requirements of the statute

intellectual property

   we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks
trade secret laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our
intellectual property and trade secrets we also enter into confidentiality
agreements with our employees consultants and current and potential
affiliates customers and business partners we also generally control access
to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information
despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or
otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without
authorization in addition we cannot assure you others will not independently
develop substantially equivalent intellectual property we cannot assure you
that the precautions we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of
our technology we have also filed over twentyfive applications for patents
with respect to certain of our technology however the us patent and
trademark office may not award any patents with respect to these applications
even if patents are issued they may not provide us with any competitive
advantage or adequately protect this technology from infringement or prevent
others from claiming our technology infringes that of third parties
furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary
rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights
in the us

   we have obtained federal trademark protection of a few of our marks
including verisign network solutions network solutions globe and gear design
and we have common law trademark rights in the us and abroad in many other
proprietary names

   with regard to our internet trust services we also rely on certain licensed
thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography technology licensed
from rsa and other technology that is used in our internetbased trust services
to perform key functions in particular rsa has granted us a perpetual
royalty free nonexclusive worldwide license to distribute internetbased
trust services we develop that contain or incorporate the rsa bsafe and tipem
products and that relate to digital certificateissuing software software for
the management of private keys and for digitally signing computer files on
behalf of others software for customers to preview and forward digital
certificate requests to us or such other services that in

                                       14
page

rsas reasonable discretion are reasonably necessary for the implementation of
a digital certificate business our agreement with rsa also requires rsa to
provide us maintenance and technical support for these services rsas bsafe
product is a software tool kit that allows for the integration of encryption
and authentication features into software applications tipem is a secure e
mail development tool kit that allows for secure email messages to be sent
using one vendors email product and read by another vendors email product
these thirdparty technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms or at all the loss of any of these technologies
could materially harm our business moreover in many of our current license
agreements the licensor has agreed to defend indemnify and hold us harmless
with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes
any patent or other proprietary right although these licenses are fully paid
we cannot assure you that the outcome of any litigation between the licensor
and a third party or between us and a third party will not lead to obligations
for us to pay royalties for which we are not indemnified or for which such
indemnification is insufficient or that we will be able to obtain any
additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all in the future
we may seek to license additional technology to incorporate in our internet
based trust services third party technology licenses that we may need to
obtain in the future may not be available to us on commercially reasonable
terms or at all

   with regard to our domain name registration services our principal
intellectual property consists of and our success is dependent upon our
proprietary software used in our registration service business and certain
methodologies and technical expertise we use in both the design and
implementation of our current and future registration services and internet
based products and services businesses we own our proprietary shared
registration system through which competing registrars including our
registrar submit com net and org secondlevel domain name registrations
some of the software and protocols we use in our registration services are in
the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors we also have
compiled a database of information relating to customers in our registration
business while a portion of this database is available to the public in the
form of a directory service we believe that we have certain ownership rights
in this database and we intend to protect these rights

   from time to time we have received and may receive in the future notice
of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights infringement or
other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future and it
is possible that past or future assertions or prosecutions could harm our
business any such claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming
result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management
personnel cause delays in the release of new internetbased trust services or
require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or
licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be
available on terms acceptable to us or at all in the event of a successful
claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop non
infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a
timely basis our business could be materially harmed

employees

   as of december 31 2000 we had 2291 fulltime employees of the total
1017 were employed in operations 492 in sales and marketing 228 in research
and development and 554 in finance and administration including information
services personnel we have never had a work stoppage and no employees are
represented under collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations
with our employees to be good our ability to achieve our financial and
operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to
attract integrate train retain and motivate highly qualified sales
technical and managerial personnel and upon the continued service of our
senior management and key sales and technical personnel none of whom is bound
by an employment agreement competition for qualified personnel in our industry
and in some of our geographical locations such as the san francisco bay area
is intense particularly in software development and product management

acquisitions and investments

   during 2000 we acquired several companies that expanded and enhanced our
product and service offerings and expanded our marketing reach in february
2000 we acquired thawte consulting pty ltd a privately held south african
company that provides digital certificates to website owners and software
developers also in february 2000 we acquired signio inc a privately held
company that provides payment services that connect online merchants business
tobusiness exchanges payment processors and financial institutions on the
internet

   in june 2000 we acquired network solutions inc a publicly traded company

for aggregate consideration of approximately 196 billion network solutions
expanded verisigns product and service offerings through the addition of the
leading domain name registrar and the exclusive registry of domain names within
the com net and org global toplevel domain names the acquisition of
network solutions is a key component of verisigns vision of expanding our
service offerings for the internet infrastructure

   in october 2000 we acquired greatdomainscom inc a privately held
company that provides services in the secondary domain name market for domain
name registrants that wish to transfer their domain name registration to
another party we also acquired several other smaller companies in 2000 that
added new technology new products and services or new distribution channels

   in 2000 we also made minority investments in several companies that build
technology or provide products and services that are complementary to our
products and services

                                  risk factors

   in addition to other information in this form 10k the following risk
factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business
because these factors currently have a significant impact or may have a
significant impact on our business operating results or financial condition
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward
looking statements contained in this form 10k as a result of the risk factors
discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k

we have a limited operating history under our current business structure

   we were incorporated in april 1995 and we began introducing our trusted
infrastructure services in june 1995 in addition we have completed several
large acquisitions in 2000 including the acquisition of network solutions
therefore we have only a limited operating history on which to base an
evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects our prospects must be
considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in
the early stages of development these risks and uncertainties are often worse
for companies in new and rapidly evolving markets and for companies integrating
many businesses our success will depend on many factors including but not
limited to the following

   the successful integration of the acquired companies

   the rate and timing of the growth and use of internet protocol or ip
    networks for electronic commerce and communications

   the extent to which digital certificates and domain names are used for
    these communications or ecommerce

   the continued growth in the number of web sites

   the growth in demand for our payment services

   the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of
    conducting business

   the demand for our internet infrastructure services digital
    certificates and web presence services

   the competition for any of our services

   the perceived security of electronic commerce and communications over ip
    networks

   the perceived security of our services technology infrastructure and
    practices and

   our continued ability to maintain our current and enter into
    additional strategic relationships

   to address these risks we must among other things

   successfully market our internet infrastructure services our digital
    certificates and our web presence services to new and existing customers

   attract integrate train retain and motivate qualified personnel

   respond to competitive developments

   successfully introduce new internet infrastructure services and web
    presence services and

   successfully introduce enhancements to our existing internet
    infrastructure services digital certificates and web presence services
    to address new technologies and standards and changing market conditions

   we cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks

                                       17

our business depends on the future growth of the internet and adoption and
continued use of ip networks

   our future success substantially depends on the continued growth in the use
of the internet and ip networks if the use of and interest in the internet and
ip networks does not continue to grow our business would be harmed to date
many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the internet
and ip networks for a number of reasons including but not limited to

   potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure

   security concerns particularly for online payments including the
    potential for merchant or user impersonation and fraud or theft of stored
    data and information communicated over ip networks

   privacy concerns including the potential for third parties obtaining
    personally identifiable information about users to disclose or sell data
    without notice to or the consent of such users

   other security concerns such as attacks on popular websites by hackers

   inconsistent quality of service

   lack of availability of costeffective highspeed systems and service

   limited number of local access points for corporate users

   inability to integrate business applications on ip networks

   the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products

   government regulation and

   a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of ip networks

   the widespread acceptance of the internet and ip networks will require a
broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging
information organizations that already have invested substantial resources in
other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods
also individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services
and effecting payments may be reluctant to change

our nearterm success depends in part on the growth of the web presence
services business

   we may not be able to sustain the revenue growth we have experienced in
recent periods in addition past revenue growth may not be indicative of
future operating results if we do not successfully maintain our current
position as a leading provider of domain name registration services or continue
to develop or market additional valueadded web presence products and services
our business could be harmed

   our web presence services will account for a significant portion of our
revenue in at least the near term our future success will depend largely on

issues arising from implementing agreements with icann and the department of
commerce could harm our registration and other businesses

   the department of commerce has adopted a plan for a phased transition of the
department of commerces responsibilities for the domain name system to icann
we face risks from this transition including the following

   icann could adopt or promote policies procedures or programs that are
    unfavorable to our role in the registration of domain names or that are
    inconsistent with our current or future plans

   the department of commerce or icann could terminate our agreements to be
    the registry or a registrar in the com net and org toplevel domains
    if they find that we are in violation of our agreements with them

   if we do not separate ownership of our registry and registrar by may 2001
    in accordance with the registry agreement the term of the registry
    agreement will expire in november 2003 and we may not be chosen as the
    successor registry

   if we divest our registrar business in order to receive an extension of
    the registry agreement to november 2007 we may not be able to sustain
    the revenue growth we have experienced in recent periods

   the terms of the registrar accreditation contract could change as a
    result of an icannadopted policy in a manner that is unfavorable to us

   the department of commerces or icanns interpretation of provisions of
    our agreements with either of them described above could differ from
    ours

   the department of commerce could revoke its recognition of icann as a
    result of which the department of commerce would take the place of icann
    for purposes of the various agreements described above and could take
    actions that are harmful to us

   icann has approved new toplevel domains and we may not be permitted to
    act as a registrar with respect to those toplevel domains

   the us government could refuse to transfer certain responsibilities for
    domain name system administration to icann due to security stability or
    other reasons resulting in fragmentation or other instability in domain
    name system administration and

   our registry business could face legal or other challenges resulting from
    the activities of registrars

challenges to ongoing privatization of internet administration could harm our
web presence services business

   risks we face from challenges by third parties including other domestic and
foreign governmental authorities to our role in the ongoing privatization of
the internet include

   legal regulatory or other challenges including challenges to the
    agreements governing our relationship with or to the legal authority
    underlying the roles and actions of the department of commerce icann or
    us could be brought

   congress has held several hearings in which various issues about the
    domain name system and icanns practices have been raised and congress
    could take action that is unfavorable to us

   congress has issued a conference report directing the general accounting
    office to review the relationship between the department of commerce and
    icann and the adequacy of security arrangements under existing department
    of commerce cooperative agreements an adverse report could cause
    congress to take action that is unfavorable to us or the stability of the
    domain name system

   icann could fail to maintain its role potentially resulting in
    instability in domain name system administration and

                                       19

   some foreign governments and governmental authorities have in the past
    disagreed with and may in the future disagree with the actions
    policies or programs of icann the us government and us relating to the
    domain name system these foreign governments or governmental authorities
    may take actions or adopt policies or programs that are harmful to our
    business

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and
profitability are uncertain

   our quarterly operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly
in the future as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside
our control these factors include the following

   continued market acceptance of our trusted infrastructure services

   the long sales and implementation cycles for and potentially large order
    sizes of some of our internet trust services and the timing and
    execution of individual contracts

   volume of domain name registrations through our web presence services
    business and our global registry service business

   customer renewal rates for our internet infrastructure services and web
    presence services

   competition in the web presence services business from competing
    registrars and registries

   the introduction of additional alternative internet naming systems

   the timing of releases of new versions of internet browsers or other
    thirdparty software products and networking equipment that include our
    digital certificate service interface technology

   the mix of all our offered services sold during a quarter

   our success in marketing other internet infrastructure services and web
    presence valueadded services to our existing customers and to new
    customers

   continued development of our direct and indirect distribution channels
    both in the us and abroad

   market acceptance of our internet infrastructure services and new service
    offerings or our competitors products and services

   a decrease in the level of spending for it related products and services
    by enterprise customers

   our ability to expand operations

   our success in assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired
    businesses

   the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our
    operations

   the impact of price changes in our internet infrastructure services and
    web presence services or our competitors products and services and

   general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to ip
    network and internet industries

   in addition we expect a significant increase in our operating expenses as
we

   amortize goodwill and other intangible assets from our acquisitions

   increase our sales and marketing operations and activities and

   continue to update our systems and infrastructure

   if the increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding
increase in our revenues our operating results will suffer particularly as
revenues from many of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the
service rather than immediately when the customer pays for them unlike our
sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred

   due to all of the above factors our quarterly revenues and operating
results are difficult to forecast therefore we believe that periodtoperiod
comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be

                                       20
page

meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future
performance also operating results may fall below our expectations and the
expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future
quarters if this were to occur the market price of our common stock would
likely decline

we face significant competition

   we anticipate that the market for services that enable trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications over ip networks will remain intensely
competitive we compete with larger and smaller companies that provide products
and services that are similar to some aspects of our internet infrastructure
services our competitors may develop new technologies in the future that are
perceived as being more secure effective or cost efficient than the technology
underlying our trust services we expect that competition will increase in the
near term and that our primary longterm competitors may not yet have entered
the market

   increased competition could result in pricing pressures reduced margins or
the failure of our internet trust services to achieve or maintain market
acceptance any of which could harm our business several of our current and
potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater
financial technical marketing and other resources as a result we may not be
able to compete effectively

   the introduction of additional competition into the web presence services
business could harm our business see businesscompetition

   the recent agreements among icann the department of commerce us and other
registrars permit flexibility in pricing for and term of registrations our
revenues therefore could be reduced due to pricing pressures bundled service
offerings and variable terms resulting from increased competition some
registrars and resellers in the com net and org toplevel domains are
already charging lower prices for web presence services in those domains in
addition other entities are bundling and may in the future bundle domain
name registrations with other products or services at reduced rates or for
free

our internet infrastructure services market is new and evolving

   we target our internet infrastructure services at the market for trusted and
secure electronic commerce and communications over ip networks this is a new
and rapidly evolving market that may not continue to grow accordingly the
demand for our internet infrastructure services is very uncertain even if the
market for electronic commerce and communications over ip networks grows our
internet infrastructure services may not be widely accepted the factors that
may affect the level of market acceptance of digital certificates and
consequently our internet infrastructure services include the following

   market acceptance of products and services based upon authentication
    technologies other than those we use

   public perception of the security of digital certificates and ip
    networks

   the ability of the internet infrastructure to accommodate increased
    levels of usage and

   government regulations affecting electronic commerce and communications
    over ip networks

   even if digital certificates achieve market acceptance our internet
infrastructure services may fail to address the markets requirements
adequately if digital certificates do not sustain or increase their
acceptance or if our internet infrastructure services in particular do not
achieve or sustain market acceptance our business would be materially harmed

system interruptions and security breaches could harm our business

   we depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various domain name
registration systems domain name zone servers domain name root servers
secure data centers and our other computer and communications

                                       21

systems we must protect these systems from loss damage or interruption caused
by fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure or other events
beyond our control most of our systems are located at and most of our
customer information is stored in our facilities in mountain view california
and kawasaki japan both of which are susceptible to earthquakes and herndon
virginia though we have backup power resources our california locations are
susceptible to recent electric power shortages all of our web presence
services systems including those used in our domain name registry and
registrar business are located at our herndon virginia facilities any damage
or failure that causes interruptions in any of these facilities or our other
computer and communications systems could materially harm our business in
addition our ability to issue digital certificates and register domain names
depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections from customers
to our secure data centers and our various registration systems as well as from
customers to our registrar and from our registrar and other registrars to the
shared registration system

   these connections depend upon efficient operation of web browsers internet
service providers and internet backbone service providers all of which have
had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past any of
these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction

   a failure in the operation of our various registration systems our domain
name zone servers the domain name root servers or other events could result in
deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time a
failure in the operation of our shared registration system could result in the
inability of one or more other registrars to register and maintain domain names
for a period of time a failure in the operation or update of the master
database that we maintain could result in deletion of one or more toplevel
domains from the internet and the discontinuation of secondlevel domain names
in those toplevel domains for a period of time the inability of our registrar
systems including our back office billing and collections infrastructure and
telecommunications systems to meet the demands of the increasing number of
domain name registration requests and corresponding customer emails and
telephone calls including speculative otherwise abusive and repetitive email
domain name registration and modification requests could result in substantial
degradation in our customer support service and our ability to process bill
and collect registration requests in a timely manner

   we retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data
centers and various registration systems it is critical to our business
strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived
by the marketplace to be secure our domain name registration operations also
depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment
in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against
interruption and potentially on such maintenance and protection by other
registrars in the shared registration system the root zone servers and top
level domain name zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our web
presence operations therefore we may have to expend significant time and
money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and
infrastructure

   despite our security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to
physical breakins computer viruses and attacks by hackers or similar
disruptive problems it is possible that we may have to expend additional
financial and other resources to address such problems any physical or
electronic breakins or other security breaches or compromises of the
information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration
systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in
the computer systems and networks of our customers in such an event we could
face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our internet
infrastructure services and web presence services such an occurrence could
also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the markets
perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip
networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services

we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations and
californias current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase
our expenses

   california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our
operations and increase our expenses in the event of an acute power shortage
that is when power reserves for the state of california fall below

                                       22
page

15 california has on some occasions implemented and may in the future
continue to implement rolling blackouts throughout the state if blackouts
interrupt our power supply we may be temporarily unable to operate any such
interruption in our ability to continue operations could damage our reputation
harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers and
could result in lost revenue any of which could substantially harm our
business and results of operations

   furthermore the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in 1996 by
the california government and shortages in wholesale electricity supplies have
caused power prices to increase if wholesale prices continue to increase our
operating expenses will likely increase as our headquarters and many of our
employees are based in california

acquisitions could harm our business

   we acquired thawte and signio in february 2000 network solutions in june
2000 greatdomains in october 2000 and nanobiz domainnamescom and namesecure
in december 2000 we could experience difficulty in integrating the personnel
products technologies or operations of these companies in addition
assimilating acquired businesses involves a number of other risks including
but not limited to

    the potential disruption of our business

    the potential impairment of relationships with our employees customers
     and strategic partners

    the additional expenses associated with the amortization of goodwill and
     other intangible assets which we expect will be an aggregate of
     approximately 20 billion for the seven acquisitions and will be
     amortized on a straightline basis generally over two to four years

    the additional expense associated with a writeoff of a portion of
     goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market
     conditions the us and global economy or the economy in the markets in
     which we compete or because acquisitions are not providing the benefits
     expected

    unanticipated costs or the incurrence of unknown liabilities

    the need to manage more geographicallydispersed operations such as
     network solutions offices in virginia thawtes offices in north
     carolina and south africa and domainnames in the uk

    diversion of managements resources from other business concerns

    the inability to retain the employees of the acquired businesses

    adverse effects on existing customer relationships of acquired
     companies

    the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the
     acquired businesses

    our inability to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our
     internet infrastructure services and

    the inability to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and
     policies

   if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future
acquisitions our business could be harmed

our investments in other companies may not yield any returns

   we have equity and debt investments in a number of companies in most
instances these investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of
private companies for which there is no public market these companies are
typically in the early stage of development and may be expected to incur
substantial losses therefore these companies may never become publicly traded
companies even if they do an active trading market for their securities may
never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments
although we have realized gains on the sale of equity investments in the past
we cannot expect to experience

                                       23
page

similar levels of other income in the future particularly in light of current
stock market conditions further if these companies are not successful we
could incur charges related to writedowns or writeoffs of these types of
assets losses or charges resulting from these investments could harm our
operating results

technological changes will affect our business

   the emerging nature of the internet digital certificate business the
domain name registration business and payment services business and their
rapid evolution requires us continually to improve the performance features
and reliability of our internet infrastructure services and web presence
services particularly in response to competitive offerings we must also
introduce any new internet infrastructure services and web presence services
as quickly as possible the success of new internet infrastructure services and
web presence services depends on several factors including proper new service
definition and timely completion introduction and market acceptance we may
not succeed in developing and marketing new internet infrastructure services
and web presence services that respond to competitive and technological
developments and changing customer needs this could harm our business

we must manage our growth and expansion

   our historical growth has placed and any further growth is likely to
continue to place a significant strain on our resources we have grown from 26
employees at december 31 1995 to over 2200 employees at december 31 2000 in
addition to internal growth our employee base grew through acquisitions we
have also opened additional sales offices and have significantly expanded our
operations both in the us and abroad during this time period to be
successful we will need to implement additional management information
systems continue the development of our operating administrative financial
and accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our
executive engineering accounting finance marketing sales and operations
organizations any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our
business

we depend on key personnel

   we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key
employees our success will also depend on our ability to attract integrate
train retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled
technical and sales and marketing personnel both in the us and abroad there
is intense competition for these personnel in addition our stringent hiring
practices for some of our key personnel which consist of background checks
into prospective employees criminal and financial histories further limit the
number of qualified persons for these positions we have no employment
agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving us at
any time in addition we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of
our officers or key employees other than our president and chief executive
officer the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other
key employees or failure to attract integrate train retain and motivate
additional key employees could harm our business

we rely on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers and route
internet communications

   we currently administer and operate only two of the 13 root zone servers
the others are administered and operated by independent operators on a
volunteer basis because of the importance to the functioning of the internet
of these root zone servers our registry services business could be harmed if
these volunteer operators fail to maintain such servers properly or abandon
such servers which would place additional capacity on the two root zone servers
we operate

   further our registry services business could be harmed if any of these
volunteer operators fails to include or provide accessibility to the data that
it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls in the event and to the
extent that icann is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative
root server system as provided in the registry agreement it is required to
ensure that the authoritative root will point to the toplevel domain zone
servers designated by it if icann does not do this our business could be
harmed

                                       24
page

   our web presence services and registry services businesses also could be
harmed if a significant number of internet service providers decided not to
route internet communications to or from domain names registered by us or if a
significant number of internet service providers decided to provide routing to
a set of domain name servers that did not point to our domain name zone
servers

we must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships

   one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic
or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger
customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing
efforts examples of these types of relationships include our arrangements with
aoltime warner cisco microsoft and rsa security we may need to enter into
additional relationships to execute our business plan we may not be able to
enter into additional or maintain our existing strategic relationships on
commercially reasonable terms if we fail to enter into additional
relationships we would have to devote substantially more resources to the
distribution sale and marketing of our services than we would otherwise our
success in obtaining results from these relationships will depend both on the
ultimate success of the other parties to these relationships particularly in
the use and promotion of ip networks for trusted and secure electronic commerce
and communications and on the ability of these parties to market our internet
infrastructure services successfully

   furthermore our ability to achieve future growth will also depend on our
ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to develop multiple
distribution channels particularly with respect to our web presence services
business to do this we must maintain relationships with internet access
providers and other third parties failure of one or more of our strategic
relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a market for our
internet infrastructure services or web presence services could harm our
business many of our existing relationships do not and any future
relationships may not afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution
rights in addition the other parties may not view their relationships with us
as significant for their own businesses therefore they could reduce their
commitment to us at any time in the future these parties could also pursue
alternative technologies or develop alternative products and services either on
their own or in collaboration with others including our competitors if we are
unable to maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships
this could harm our business

some of our internet trust services have lengthy sales and implementation
cycles

   we market many of our internet trust services directly to large companies
and government agencies the sale and implementation of our services to these
entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant
technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources this
process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers
internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital
expenditures deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and
accepting new technologies that affect key operations as a result the sales
and implementation cycles associated with certain of our internet trust
services can be lengthy potentially lasting from three to six months our
quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed if orders
forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized

our services could have unknown defects

   services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain
undetected defects or errors despite testing defects or errors may occur in
our existing or new services which could result in loss of or delay in
revenues loss of market share failure to achieve market acceptance diversion
of development resources injury to our reputation tort or warranty claims
increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which
could harm our business furthermore we often provide implementation
customization consulting and other technical services in connection with the
implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services which typically
involves working with sophisticated software computing and communications
systems our failure to meet customer expectations in a timely manner could
also result in loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share failure to
achieve market acceptance injury to our reputation and increased costs

                                       25

public key cryptography technology is subject to risks

   our internet infrastructure services depend on public key cryptography
technology with public key cryptography technology a user is given a public
key and a private key both of which are required to perform encryption and
decryption operations the security afforded by this technology depends on the
integrity of a users private key and that it is not lost stolen or otherwise
compromised the integrity of private keys also depends in part on the
application of specific mathematical principles known as factoring this
integrity is predicated on the assumption that the factoring of large numbers
into their prime number components is difficult should an easy factoring
method be developed the security of encryption products utilizing public key
cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated furthermore any
significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could
also render some or all of our existing internet trust services obsolete or
unmarketable if improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems were
ever developed we would likely have to reissue digital certificates to some or
all of our customers which could damage our reputation and brand or otherwise
harm our business in the past there have been public announcements of the
successful attack upon cryptographic keys of certain kinds and lengths and of
the potential misappropriation of private keys and other activation data this
type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the safety of the
public key cryptography technology included in our digital certificates this
negative public perception could harm our business

our international operations are subject to certain risks

   revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for
approximately 14 of our revenues in the full year of 2000 we intend to expand
our international operations and international sales and marketing activities
for example with our acquisition of thawte we have additional operations in
south africa and with our acquisition of network solutions we have additional
operations in asia and europe expansion into these markets has required and
will continue to require significant management attention and resources we may
also need to tailor our internet infrastructure trust services and web presence
services for a particular market and to enter into international distribution
and operating relationships we have limited experience in localizing our
services and in developing international distribution or operating
relationships we may not succeed in expanding our services into international
markets failure to do so could harm our business in addition there are risks
inherent in doing business on an international basis including among others

    competition with foreign companies or other domestic companies entering
     the foreign markets we are in

    regulatory requirements

    legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with foreign laws

    export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products
     incorporating that technology

    tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions

    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations

    longer sales and payment cycles

    problems in collecting accounts receivable

    currency fluctuations

    difficulty of authenticating customer information

    political instability

    failure of foreign laws to protect our us proprietary rights
     adequately

    more stringent privacy policies in foreign countries

                                       26

    seasonal reductions in business activity and

    potentially adverse tax consequences

   we have licensed to our affiliates the verisign processing center platform
which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows the
affiliate to offer backend processing of internet infrastructure services the
verisign processing center platform provides an affiliate with the knowledge
and technology to offer internet infrastructure services similar to those
offered by us it is critical to our business strategy that the facilities and
infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital certificates remain secure
and we are perceived by the marketplace to be secure although we provide the
affiliate with training in security and trust practices network management and
customer service and support these practices are performed by the affiliate
and are outside of our control any failure of an affiliate to maintain the
privacy of confidential customer information could result in negative publicity
and therefore adversely affect the markets perception of the security of our
services as well as the security of electronic commerce and communication over
ip networks generally for further information please see risk factors
system interruptions and security breaches could harm our business

   all of our international revenues from sources other than verisign japan and
thawte consulting are denominated in us dollars if additional portions of
our international revenues were to be denominated in foreign currencies we
could become subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations

our internet infrastructure services could be affected by government
regulation

   exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally
restricted by the united states and various nonunited states governments
although we have obtained approval to export our global server digital
certificate service and none of our other internet infrastructure services are
currently subject to export controls under united states law the list of
products and countries for which export approval is required could be revised
in the future to include more digital certificate products and related
services if we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell
specific internet infrastructure services in international markets there are
currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certificate
authorities but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or
regulations with respect to certificate authorities if the market for digital
certificates grows the united states federal or state or nonunited states
governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certificate
authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related
services these regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations
could harm our business

   in july 2000 the electronic signatures in global and national commerce act
or esign was passed esign is intended to render digital signatures
legally equivalent to those signed on paper the execution of esign could
materially and adversely affect our digital certificates services business for
example there may be an increasing demand for digital signatures and
certificates as a result of the new esign law however due to competition or
other reasons our services may not be adopted if we cannot meet market
expectations or demand for our products and services does not increase our
business may be materially and adversely affected furthermore a successful
implementation of esign may further encourage competitors to enter the
marketplace because of the possible increase in demand for digital signatures
and certificates this could effectively lower barriers to entry and
increasingly flood the marketplace with competitors which could among other
things result in price erosion while we cannot assure you that esign will be
effectively implemented or how this implementation will affect our business we
must continue to meet the demand and expectations of our customers our failure
to do so could materially and adversely harm our business

we face risks related to intellectual property rights

   our success depends on our internally developed technologies and other
intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for a third
party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or other

                                       27
page

forms of our intellectual property without authorization in addition it is
possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent
intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual
property our business could suffer

   in the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our
intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the
validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this type of
litigation regardless of its outcome could result in substantial costs and
diversion of management and technical resources

   we also license thirdparty technology such as public key cryptography
technology licensed from rsa and other technology that is used in our products
to perform key functions these thirdparty technology licenses may not
continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our
business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies a third
party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other
proprietary right litigation between the licensor and a third party or between
us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not
indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient or we may not be able
to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all
the loss of or our inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology
licenses could delay the introduction of our internet infrastructure services
until equivalent technology if available is identified licensed and
integrated this could harm our business

   from time to time we have received and may receive in the future notice
of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights infringement or
other claims could be made against us in the future any claims with or
without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and
diversion of technical and management personnel cause product shipment delays
or require us to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or
licensing agreements royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be
available on acceptable terms or at all if a successful claim of product
infringement were made against us and we could not develop noninfringing
technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost
effective basis our business could be harmed

   in addition legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and
scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internetrelated
businesses are uncertain and still evolving because of the growth of the
internet and internetrelated businesses patent applications are continuously
and simultaneously being filed in connection with internetrelated technology
there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent
applications in our areas of interest and we believe that there has been and
is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding
patent and other intellectual property rights

we have implemented antitakeover provisions

   provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party
to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions
include

    our stockholders may only take action at a meeting and not by written
     consent

    our board must be given advance notice regarding stockholdersponsored
     proposals for consideration at annual meetings and for stockholder
     nominations for the election of directors

    we have a classified board of directors with the board being divided
     into three classes that serve staggered threeyear terms

    vacancies on our board may be filled until the next annual meeting of
     stockholders only by majority vote of the directors then in office and

    special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the chairman
     of the board the president or by the board not by our stockholders

                                       28

   while we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a
higher bid by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of
directors these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered
beneficial by some stockholders

item 3 legal proceedings

   as of february 28 2001 through our network solutions subsidiary we were a
defendant in 16 active lawsuits involving domain name disputes between
trademark owners and domain name holders we are drawn into such disputes in
part as a result of claims by trademark owners that we are legally required
upon request by a trademark owner to terminate the contractual right we
granted to a domain name holder to register a domain name which is alleged to
be similar to the trademark in question on october 25 1999 however the
ninth circuit court of appeals ruled in our favor and against lockheed
corporation holding that our services do not make us liable for contributory
infringement to trademark owners since that time the frequency of this type
of suit has continued to decline the holders of the domain name registrations
in dispute have in turn questioned our right absent a court order to take
any action regarding their contractual rights to the domain names in question
although 83 of these kinds of situations have resulted in suits actually naming
network solutions as a defendant as of february 28 2001 no adverse judgment
has been rendered and no award of damages has ever been made and no such suits
are currently pending against network solutions we believe that we have
meritorious defenses and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these
claims

   on february 2 2001 leon stambler filed a complaint against us alleging
patent infringement in the united states district court for the district of
delaware the other codefendants in the suit are rsa security inc first data
corporation openwave systems inc and omnisky corporation the complaint
alleges that our secure site service infringes claim 12 of mr stamblers us
patent no 5793302 and that our payflow products infringe claims 1 28 and
34 of mr stamblers us patent no 5974148 the complaint seeks judgment
declaring that the defendants have infringed the asserted claims of the
patentsinsuit preliminary and permanent injunctions against the defendants
from infringing the asserted claims an order requiring the defendants to pay
damages to compensate mr stambler for the alleged infringement and an order
awarding mr stambler treble damages for any willful infringement as well as
attorney fees and costs while we cannot predict the outcome of this matter
presently we currently believe that the claims against us are without merit
and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims

   on june 15 2000 plaintiff david moran filed a putative shareholder
derivative complaint on behalf of himself and others similarly situated against
charles stuckey jr james bidzos richard l earnest dr taher elgamel
james k sims joseph b lassuter iii robert p badavas and against us as a
nominal defendant the case is captioned moran v stuckey et al no 1810 nc
del ch 2000 the complaint alleges among other things that the directors
of rsa security mismanaged rsas business failed to protect its intellectual
property or enforce the terms of its license agreement with us and that we
violated the terms of the licensing agreement and competed against rsa on
august 2 2000 a second shareholder complaint was filed against us and the
aforementioned directors of rsa security inc by plaintiff james v biglan the
case is captioned biglan v stuckey et al civ action no 18190nc del ch
2000 on september 25 2000 the court ordered the cases consolidated under the
moran caption and named lead counsel for plaintiffs in this matter we filed a
motion to dismiss on november 20 2000 while we cannot predict the outcome of
this matter presently we currently believe that the claims against us are
without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these
claims

   on march 15 2000 a group of eight plaintiffs filed suit against the us
department of commerce the national science foundation and us in the united
states district court for the northern district of california the case
entitled william hoefer et al v us department of commerce et al civil
action no 000918vrw challenges the lawfulness of the registration fees that
we were authorized to charge for domain name registrations from september 1995
to november 1999 the suit purports to be brought on behalf of all domain name
registrants who paid registration fees during that period and seeks
approximately 17 billion in damages on june 19 2000 the plaintiffs filed
their first amended complaint adding two additional plaintiffs

   all of the defendants filed motions to transfer the suit to federal district
court in the district of columbia and the court granted those motions on june
28 2000 the same attorney who unsuccessfully challenged us in a similar
action known as thomas et al v network solutions et al has filed this
new action on behalf of

                                       30
page

eight former and current domain name registrants the suit contains eight
causes of action against the defendants based on alleged violations of art i
s 8 and the fifth amendment of the us constitution the independent offices
appropriations act 31 usc s 9701 the administrative procedures act the
sherman act and the california unfair competition act s 17200 the case was
docketed with the federal district court in the district of columbia on july
28 2000 and on august 4 2000 the plaintiffs dismissed the case four days
later the same attorney refiled the same case in the united states district
court for the eastern district of virginia we filed a motion to dismiss the
case and the plaintiffs responded by filing a first amended complaint on
september 7 2000 the current suit contains fourteen causes of action alleging
violations of the appropriations act 31 usc 9701 the administrative
procedures act the sherman act and the chief financial officers act 31
usc 902 on october 10 2000 we filed another motion to dismiss the case
on october 24 2000 the national science foundation filed a motion to transfer
the case back to the federal district court in the district of columbia a
hearing on the motion to transfer the case back to the federal district court
for the district of columbia was held on november 17 2000 the court ruled
from the bench that the case should be transferred back to the district of
columbia our pending motion to dismiss the complaint also was transferred
under the order no judge has been appointed to the matter and no hearing date
has yet been set on our motion to dismiss

   on january 13 2000 the department of justice antitrust division issued a
civil investigative demand or cid seeking information and documents
concerning the thenpending acquisition by us of thawte we provided certain
information and documents to the department of justice and closed the thawte
transaction on february 1 2000 we completed our initial response to the cid
on march 1 2000 and a supplemental production of documents was completed may
9 2000 on september 14 2000 we were notified that senior officials at the
department of justice had reviewed a report by the investigatory staff
regarding the transaction and that the department had concerns about the
potential competitive effects of the transaction our representatives met with
and provided additional information to the department of justice during october
2000 while we believe that the transaction does not violate the antitrust
laws it is possible that the department may ultimately raise an objection
formal objection could lead to further proceedings or litigation that could
have an adverse material effect on us and could include the licensing or
divestiture of assets acquired in the transaction

   we are involved in various other investigations claims and lawsuits arising
in the normal conduct of our business none of which in our opinion will harm
our business we cannot assure that we will prevail in any litigation
regardless of the outcome any litigation may require us to incur significant
litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of management
attention an unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations



item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders

   no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter

   on march 15 2001 there were 856 holders of record of our common stock
although we believe there are in excess of 150000 beneficial owners

   the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to
be highly volatile and significantly affected by factors such as

   general market and economic conditions and market conditions affecting
    technology and internet stocks generally

   actual or anticipated fluctuations in its quarterly or annual
    registrations or operating results

   announcements of technological innovations acquisitions or investments
    developments in internet governance or corporate actions such as stock
    splits and

   industry conditions and trends

   the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations
that have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology
companies especially internetrelated companies these broad market or
technology or internet sector fluctuations may adversely affect the market
price of our common stock recently the market price of our common stock like
that of many internetrelated companies has experienced significant
fluctuations during 2000 the reported last sale price for our splitadjusted
common stock ranged from 6813 per share to 25300 per share on march 15
2001 the reported last sale price of our splitadjusted common stock was
3444 per share

   the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue
to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors reports
and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views the fact that
we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not
necessarily mean that it will do so in the future

   in the past securities class action lawsuits have often followed periods of
volatility in the market price of a particular companys securities this type
of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our
managements attention and resources

  revenues

   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sop 972 software
revenue recognition as modified by sop 989 sop 972 as modified generally
requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements
such as software products upgrades enhancements post contract customer
support or pcs installation training etc to be allocated to each element
based on the relative fair values of the elements the fair value of an element
must be based on evidence that is specific to the vendor if evidence of fair
value does not exist for all elements of a license agreement and pcs is the
only undelivered element then all revenue for the license arrangement is
recognized ratably over the term of the agreement if evidence of fair value of
all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more
delivered elements

                                       37
page

then revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual
method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the
remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue

   revenues from authentication services consist of fees for the issuance of
digital certificates fees for digital certificate service provisioning fees
for technology and business process licensing to affiliates and fees for
consulting implementation training support and maintenance services each
of these sources of revenue has different revenue recognition methods
revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and
recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate generally 12
months revenues from the sale of onsite managed services are deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of the license generally 12 months

   revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business
process technology are sold in arrangements involving multiple elements
including pcs training and other services pcs can be renewed annually for an
additional fee we use the pcs renewal rate as evidence of fair value of pcs
the company establishes evidence of fair value for training and other services
through the price charged when the same element is sold separately since we
have established evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements of the
arrangement revenue is recognized under the residual method the fair value
of pcs is recognized over the pcs term training and other service revenue is
recognized when delivered and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
recognized after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the
product to the customer provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding
the product acceptance fees are fixed and determinable collectibility is
probable and the company has no remaining obligations other than the delivery
of pcs

   revenues from consulting and training services are recognized using the
percentageofcompletion method for fixedfee development arrangements or as
the services are provided for timeandmaterials arrangements

   revenues from payment services primarily consist of a setup fee and a
monthly service fee for the transaction processing services in accordance
with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in
financial statements revenues from the setup fee are deferred and
recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned revenues from the
service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are
provided advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated
ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided

   domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees
charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services
revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name registration services are
deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term generally two
years domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration
fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration
services we defer revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name
registration services and recognize these revenues ratably over the
registration term

   we accounted for the june 8 2000 network solutions acquisition as a
purchase and network solutions revenues which are derived primarily from web
presence services have been included in our results of operations commencing
june 9 2000 in addition we also acquired thawte and signio in february
2000 therefore comparisons of revenues for the year ended december 31 2000
to the years ended december 31 1999 and 1998 may not be relevant as the
businesses of the combined company were not equivalent

   a comparison of revenues for the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and
1998 is presented below



                                            2000   change  1999   change  1998

   revenues 474766  460  84776  118  38930


   the increase in revenues in 2000 from 1999 is primarily due to the
acquisition of thawte signio and network solutions in addition we increased
sales of our authentication services particularly our website digital
certificates and verisign onsite services expanded our international
affiliate network and delivered

                                      38

more training and consulting services as of december 31 2000 we have sold
over 485000 website digital certificates and over 1600 onsite service
solutions to enterprises and we have 35 affiliates in our international
network of affiliates

   a small portion of our revenue mix is from payment transaction services
provided by signio now verisign payment services at december 31 2000 the
customer base for these services had grown to more than 15100 online merchants
using our payment services to paymentenable their online stores and business
tobusiness commerce activities

   the year ended december 31 2000 reflects approximately six and onehalf
months of activity from network solutions at december 31 2000 the cumulative
base of name registrations totaled 151 million an increase of 80 million
from december 31 1999 for the full year of 2000 the registrar completed
104 million transactions supporting the addition transfer renewal and
extension of com net and org domain names the registry now verisign
global registry added 192 million names during the full year of 2000
bringing total unique names to 282 million at december 31 2000 during the
full year of 2000 the registry completed 238 million transactions supporting
the addition transfer renewal and extension of com net and org domain
names

   revenues increased significantly in 1999 from 1998 due to higher sales of
our internetbased trust services particularly our website digital
certificates affiliate processing and service centers verisign onsite
services and the delivery of more training and services in addition in 1999
we expanded our international affiliate network and experienced significant
growth in international markets in 1998 we completed certain work required
under various consulting contracts and recognized the related portion of
revenues there were no significant increases in our perunit prices in 2000
compared to 1999 or in 1999 compared to 1998

   no customer accounted for 10 or more of revenues in 2000 1999 or 1998
revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for 14 of
total revenues in 2000 27 in 1999 and 14 in 1998

  costs and expenses

   we accounted for all of our acquisitions in 2000 as purchase transactions
accordingly the acquired companies costs and expenses have been included in
our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition therefore
comparisons of costs and expenses for the year ended december 31 2000 to the
years ended december 31 1999 and 1998 may not be relevant as the businesses
of the combined company were not equivalent

 cost of revenues

   cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital
certificate enrollment and issuance services payment services domain name
registration services customer support and training consulting and
development services and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in
these activities in addition with respect to our digital certificate
services cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify
certificate applicants identities insurance premiums for our service warranty
plan and errors and omission insurance and the cost of software resold to
customers

   a comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 2000 1999
and 1998 is presented below

   percentage of revenues       34             38             50


   growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of
revenues in 2000 from 1999 and in 1999 from 1998 we hired more employees to
support the growth of demand for our products and services

                                       39
page

during the period and to support the growth of our security consulting and
training activities we incurred increased expenses for access to thirdparty
databases higher support charges for our external disaster recovery program
increased customer service costs related to our larger customer base and
increased expenses related to the cost of software products resold to customers
as part of network security solution implementations our acquisitions of
thawte signio and network solutions have resulted in an increase in our cost
of revenues in 2000 over prior years future acquisitions further expansion
into international markets and introductions of additional products will result
in further increases in cost of revenues due to additional personnel and
related expenses and other factors we anticipate that cost of revenues will
continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of continued growth in all
of our lines of business

   cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2000 from 1999 and
in 1999 from 1998 primarily due to the continued realization of economies of
scale from our technology infrastructure and the efficiency gains in the
certificate enrollment and issuance process in addition revenues derived from
our recent acquisitions of thawte signio and network solutions have a
different cost structure from our authentication services

   certain of our services such as implementation consulting and training
require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs
than other types of services as a result we anticipate that cost of revenues
as a percentage of revenues will vary in future periods depending on the mix of
services sold

 sales and marketing

   sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales
marketing and external affair activities these expenses include salaries
sales commissions and other personnelrelated expenses travel and related
expenses costs of computer and communications equipment and support services
facilities costs consulting fees and costs of marketing programs such as
internet television radio and print advertising

   a comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december
31 2000 1999 and 1998 is presented below

   percentage of revenues       35             40             59


   the network solutions acquisition was the primary reason for the increase in
sales and marketing expenses in 2000 as compared to 1999 the web presence
services group continues to incur expenses promoting the value of the com
 net and org web addresses as well as valueadded services including web site
design tools and other enhanced service offerings the remainder of the
increase in 2000 was driven by lead and demand generation activities in our
authentication businesses expansion of our sales force an increase in
international sales expenses and the effect of sales and marketing expenses
from thawte and signio sales and marketing expenses increased in 1999 from
1998 as a result of the continued growth of our direct sales force and the
expansion of our marketing efforts particularly in lead and demand generation
activities the expansion of our international sales presence in europe during
the second half of 1999 also contributed to the increase from 1998

   while the absolute dollar spending increased for sales and marketing
expenses we continue to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a
percentage of revenues over the threeyear period this is primarily due to the
increase in recurring revenues from existing customers which tend to have
lower acquisition costs and the increase in the productivity of our direct
sales forces however we cannot forecast that these sales and marketing
expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues

   we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase on an
absolute dollar basis in the future primarily related to an expanded sales
force expanded marketing and demand generation activities

development and enhancement of partner and distribution channels and
promotional activities for web presence products and services

 research and development

   research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to
research and development personnel including salaries and other personnel
related expenses consulting fees and the costs of facilities computer and
communications equipment and support services used in service and technology
development

   a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended
december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 is presented below

   percentage of revenues       9             16            22


   research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in 2000 from
1999 primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in addition the
increase in 2000 from 1999 as well as the increase in 1999 from 1998 is also
due to continued investment in the design testing and deployment of and
technical support for our expanded internet trust service offerings and
technology the increase reflects the expansion of our engineering staff and
related costs required to support our continued emphasis on developing new
products and services as well as enhancing existing products and services the
decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues in
2000 from 1999 and in 1999 from 1998 is largely due to the fact that revenues
increased faster than research and development expenses in these periods the
decrease in 2000 from 1999 is also due in part to different cost structures
related to our acquisitions

   we believe that timely development of new and enhanced authentication
services transaction services web presence services and technology are
necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace accordingly we intend
to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to
make other investments in research and development as a result we expect
research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute
dollars to date we have expensed all research and development expenditures as
incurred

 general and administrative

   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other
personnelrelated expenses for our executive administrative legal finance
and human resources personnel facilities and computer and communications
equipment support services and professional services fees

   a comparison of general and administrative expenses for the years ended
december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 is presented below

   percentage of revenues      13            10            20


   the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2000 over 1999 was
related to the acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 and the
acquisition of thawte and signio in the first quarter of 2000 expenses also
increased in 2000 from 1999 as well as in 1999 from 1998 due to additional
staffing levels required to manage and support our expanded operations the
implementation of additional management information systems and the expansion
of our corporate headquarters the increase in general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2000 from 1999 is primarily due to
incremental expenses related to integrating our acquisitions and different cost
structures of those acquisitions

                                       41
page

   the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
revenues in 1999 from 1998 is primarily due to the fact that revenues increased
faster than general and administrative expenses as we began to experience
economies of scale in our corporate infrastructure

   we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to
increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future as we expand our
administrative and executive staff add infrastructure expand facilities and
assimilate acquired technologies and businesses

 writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development

   the portion of the network solutions purchase price allocated to inprocess
research and development or iprd was 54 million and was expensed during the
quarter ended june 30 2000 network solutions iprd efforts focused on
significant and substantial improvements and upgrades to its shared
registration system  or srs the srs is the system that provides shared
registration interface to the accredited and licensed registrars into the com
 net and org top level domain  or tld name registry it is through this
system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain
names with the central database given the high demand on the srs it is in
need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability security non
english language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol

   as of the acquisition date network solutions was in the process of
developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to
the srs the iprd had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses the iprd under development may not achieve technical or
commercial viability the technological feasibility of the inprocess
development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all
planning designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to
establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications
including functions features and technical performance requirements as of
december 31 2000 the development efforts related to upgrades and improvements
in the srs and other systems are ongoing and expected to be completed by march
31 2001

   the fair value assigned to iprd was estimated by discounting to present
value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached
technological feasibility a discount rate of 22 was used to estimate the
present value of cash flows the value assigned to iprd was the amount
attributable to the efforts of network solutions up to the time of acquisition
this amount was estimated through application of the stage of completion
calculation by multiplying the estimated present value of future cash flows
excluding costs of completion by the percentage of completion of the purchased
research and development project at the time of acquisition

 amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets

   goodwill and other intangible assets resulted primarily from our
acquisitions of thawte and signio in february 2000 network solutions in june
2000 and other individually insignificant acquisitions in 2000 we expect to
recognize goodwill and other intangible asset amortization charges related to
these acquisitions of up to 14 billion per quarter until the goodwill and
other intangible asset balances from these acquisitions become fully amortized
which we currently anticipate ending in 2004 in addition in the event we
complete future acquisitions we expect to incur additional goodwill and other
intangible asset amortization charges

 special charges

   in connection with our acquisition of secureit which was accounted for as a
poolingofinterests we recorded a special charge of 36 million to operating
expenses in the third quarter of 1998 the expenses included 24 million for
direct and other mergerrelated costs pertaining to the merger transaction
merger transaction costs consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers
attorneys accountants filing fees and other related charges the remaining
12 million related to stockbased compensation charges in connection with the
acceleration of certain performance stock options held by secureit employees

                                       42

  other income

   other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash cash
equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments and gains on sale of
equity investments as well as the net effect of foreign currency transaction
gains and losses other income also includes charges for any gains or losses
on the disposal of property and equipment and other miscellaneous expenses

   a comparison of other income for the years ended december 31 2000 1999
and 1998 is presented below

   percentage of revenues      18             8             5


   the increase in other income in 2000 from 1999 is primarily due to
increased earnings on funds invested investments have increased in part due
to our net proceeds of 1214 million generated from the followon public
offering of our common stock during january 1999 and investment of cash
generated from operations the investment base was also significantly
increased through the acquisition of network solutions which added over 925
million of cash and investments the increase in 2000 over 1999 was also due
to a 326 million gain from the sale of shares of keynote systems inc we
may from time to time derive gains from the sales of our equity investments
although due to current market conditions we do not expect any such gains to
be material in amount

  provision for income taxes

   we have not recorded any provision for federal and state income taxes
because we have experienced an accumulated deficit since inception as of
december 31 2000 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately 3401 million related to stock compensation expense and 3948
million related to continuing operations we also had state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately 1907 million related to stock compensation
expense and 1334 million related to continuing operations if we are not
able to use them the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in
2010 through 2020 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire
in 2004 through 2020 the tax reform act of 1986 imposes substantial
restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the
event of a corporations ownership change as defined in the internal revenue
code our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited
as a result of such ownership change we do not anticipate that any material
limitation exists on our ability to use our carryforwards and credits

   we have provided a full valuation allowance on the remaining deferred tax
assets because of the uncertainty regarding their realization our accounting
for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 109
accounting for income taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors
concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets in concluding that a
full valuation allowance was required we considered such factors as our
history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our
deferred tax assets although our operating plans assume taxable and operating
income in future periods our evaluation of all of the available evidence in
assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such
plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative
evidence the current year increase to the valuation allowance offsets
deferred tax assets which arose as the result of ongoing operations
accordingly the reversal of this years incremental increase to the valuation
allowance will result in future income statement benefit the remaining
valuation allowance relates to stock option exercises reversal of the
valuation allowance related to stock option exercises will result in a credit
to additional paid in capital and will not result in future income statement
benefit see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements

  minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary

   minority interest in the net income loss of verisign japan kk was 13
million in 2000 8 million in 1999 and 13 million in 1998 the yeartoyear
changes are primarily due to verisign japans increased revenue as compared to
the prior years as the verisign japan business continues to develop and
evolve we expect that the minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary
will fluctuate

   prior to our initial public offering we financed our operations primarily
through private sales of equity securities raising approximately 461
million our initial public offering which we completed in january 1998
yielded net proceeds of approximately 437 million on the sale of 138 million
shares of common stock in january 1999 we sold an additional 64 million
shares of common stock to the public for net proceeds of approximately 1214
million the acquisition of network solutions added an additional
8673 million of liquidity at december 31 2000 our principal source of
liquidity was 10 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm
investments consisting principally of commercial paper medium term corporate
notes corporate bonds and notes market auction securities us government
and agency securities and money market funds in addition we hold 2091
million of longterm equity minority investments and corporate debt securities

   net cash provided by operating activities was 1920 million in 2000 and
147 million in 1999 the increase was primarily due to an overall increase in
net income after adjustment for noncash items such as depreciation and
amortization and the writeoff of inprocess research and development an
overall increase in accounts payable accrued liabilities refundable taxes and
our deferred revenue balance in which we receive payment in advance for many of
our products and services in 1998 cash used for operating activities was
118 million that was primarily the result of net losses and an increase in
accounts receivable

   net cash provided by investing activities was 1240 million in 2000
primarily as a result of the cash acquired in our acquisitions partially
offset by increased purchases of short and longterm investments and costs
relating to our acquisitions net cash used in investing activities was 1032
million in 1999 and 160 million in 1998 in 1999 net cash used in investing
activities primarily related to net purchases of investments in 1998 net cash
used in investing activities was primarily the result of capital expenditures
for property and equipment and net purchases of investments capital
expenditures for property and equipment totaled 588 million in 2000 60
million in 1999 and 44 million in 1998 our planned capital expenditures for
2001 are approximately 135 million to 145 million primarily for computer and
communications equipment and leasehold improvements as of december 31 2000
we also had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities
for various terms through 2011 see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial
statements

   net cash provided by financing activities was 735 million in 2000 1362
million in 1999 and 457 million in 1998 in 2000 cash was provided primarily
from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises in 1999 we
received net cash proceeds of 1214 million from the public offering of our
stock and in 1998 we received net cash proceeds of 437 million from our
initial public offering

   we believe our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments
and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however at
some time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private
financing strategic

                                       44
page

relationships or other arrangements this additional funding if needed might
not be available on terms attractive to us or at all failure to raise capital
when needed could materially harm our business if we raise additional funds
through the issuance of equity securities the percentage of our stock owned by
our thencurrent stockholders will be reduced furthermore these equity
securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of our
common stock

recently issued accounting pronouncements

   in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas
133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the new
standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities it requires companies to record
derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair
value accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the
intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting
sfas 133 as amended by sfas 137 and sfas 138 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after june 15 2000 historically the company has not entered into
derivatives contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative
purposes adoption of the new standard will not have a material affect on the
companys consolidated financial statements



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate sensitivity

   the primary objective of verisigns investment activities is to preserve
principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our
investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities that
we have invested in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in
prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to
fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed
interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate
later rises the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in
value if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by
10 percent from levels at december 31 2000 this would not materially change
the fair market value of our portfolio to minimize this risk we maintain our
portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of
securities including commercial paper mediumterm notes corporate bonds and
notes market auction securities us government and agency securities and
money market funds in general money market funds are not subject to interest
rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the
prevailing interest rate in addition we generally invest in relatively short
term securities as of december 31 2000 94 of our nonstrategic investments
mature in less than one year

   the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and
investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and
weightedaverage interest rates as of december 31 2000 this table does not
include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk

exchange rate sensitivity

   verisign considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations to be minimal all revenues derived from affiliates other than
verisign japan and thawte consulting are denominated in united states dollars
and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations

   both the revenues and expenses of our majorityowned subsidiary in japan are
denominated in japanese yen and the revenues and expenses of our activities
conducted through south africa are denominated in south african rand in both
regions we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate
fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the
foreign currency against the united states dollar will result in lower revenues
when translated to united states dollars operating expenses will also be lower
in these circumstances our subsidiary in sweden has not had significant
operations to date

   because of our minimal exposure to foreign currencies we have not engaged
in any hedging transactions to date

equity price risk

   we own shares of common stock of several public companies we value these
investments using the closing fair market value for the last day of each month
these investments are subject to market price volatility we reflect these
investments in our balance sheet at their market value with the unrealized
gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the accumulated other
comprehensive income component of stockholders equity as a result of recent
market price volatility of our publicly traded investments we experienced a
889 million unrealized loss net of tax on these investments during 2000 in
addition we have invested in equity instruments of several privately held
companies many of which can still be considered in the startup or development
stages these investments are accounted for under the cost method we do not
hedge against equity price changes

intangible asset risk

   we have a substantial amount of intangible assets although at december 31
2000 we believe our intangible assets are recoverable changes in the economy
the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change
the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability we continue
to monitor those assumptions and their consequent effect on the estimated
recoverability of our intangible assets

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded for
deferred tax assets whose realization is not sufficiently likely

 net income loss per share

   basic net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average
number of outstanding shares of common stock diluted net income loss per
share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options if any computed using
the treasury stock method and convertible securities using the ifconverted
method

in the basic and diluted net income loss per share computations

 impairment of longlived assets

   verisigns longlived assets consist primarily of goodwill and other
intangible assets property and equipment and other longterm assets verisign
reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable such events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable such events or circumstances include but
are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying
business a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired
business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business

   recoverability of longlived assets is measured by comparison of the
carrying amount to future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected
to generate if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long
lived asset exceeds its fair market value to date results of operations and
cash flows from verisigns acquisitions have been consistent with original
expectations and no adjustments to the carrying value of longlived assets have
been required however changes in the economy the business in which the
company operates and verisigns own relative performance could change the
assumptions used to evaluate the recovery of goodwill and other intangible
assets verisign monitors the preceding factors to identify events or
circumstances which would cause the company to test for impairment and revise
its assumptions on the estimated recovery of goodwill and intangible assets

 use of estimates

   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

 recently issued accounting pronouncements

   in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas
133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the new
standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities it requires companies to record
derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair
value accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the
intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting
sfas 133 as amended by sfas 137 and sfas 138 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after june 15 2000 historically the company has not entered into
derivatives contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative
purposes adoption of the new standard will not have a material affect on the
companys consolidated financial statements

iprd efforts focused on significant and substantial improvements and upgrades
to its shared registration system or srs the srs is the system that provides
shared registration interface to the accredited and licensed registrars into
the com net and org top level domain or tld name registry it is through
this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain
names with the central database given the high demand on the srs it is in
need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability security non
english language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol

   as of the acquisition date network solutions was in the process of
developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to
the srs the iprd had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses the iprd under development may not achieve technical or
commercial viability the technological feasibility of the inprocess
development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all
planning designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to
establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications
including functions features and technical performance requirements this
estimate was based on the project costs and milestones as of december 31
2000 the development efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the srs
and other systems are ongoing and expected to be completed by march 31 2001

   the fair value assigned to iprd was estimated by discounting to present
value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached
technological feasibility a discount rate of 22 was used to estimate the
present value of cash flows which is consistent with the risk of the project
the value assigned to iprd was the amount attributable to the efforts of the
seller up to the time of acquisition this amount was estimated through
application of the stage of completion calculation by multiplying the
estimated present value of future cash flows excluding costs of completion by
the percentage of completion of the purchased research and development project
at the time of acquisition

 pro forma results of operations

   the following summary prepared on a pro forma basis presents the results
of operations as if thawte signio and network solutions had been acquired as

note 7 income taxes

   total income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2000 and 1999 was
allocated as follows

   the difference between income tax expense and the amount resulting from
applying the federal statutory rate of 35 to income before income taxes for
2000 is attributable to the following

   in 1999 and 1998 verisign did not record any income tax expense because it
experienced significant operating losses

   the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of verisigns deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows

   in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax
assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which temporary differences become deductible management does not believe it
is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized
accordingly a full valuation allowance has been established and no deferred
tax asset is shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the total
valuation allowance increased 61107000 in 2000 and decreased 18439000 in
1999

   as of december 31 2000 verisign has available net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately 340061000
related to stock compensation expense and approximately 394820000 related to
continuing operations verisign has available net operating loss carryforwards
for state income tax purposes of approximately 190665000 related to stock
compensation expense and approximately 133398000 related to continuing
operations the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not
utilized in 2010 through 2020 the state net operating loss carryforwards will
expire if not utilized in 2004 through 2020

   as of december 31 2000 verisign has available for carryover research and
experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately
2901000 and for state income tax purposes of approximately 1411000 the
federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire if not utilized
in 2010 through 2020 state research and experimental tax credits carry forward
indefinitely until utilized

 legal proceedings

   the department of justice doj antitrust division issued a civil
investigative demand cid seeking information and documents concerning the
then pending acquisition by verisign of thawte verisign has complied with the
information requests of the cid and has provided additional information to the
doj to alleviate their concerns about the potential competitive effects of the
transaction while management believes that the transaction does not violate
the antitrust laws it is possible that the doj may ultimately raise an
objection formal objection could lead to further proceedings or litigation
that could have an adverse material effect on verisign and could include the
licensing or divestiture of assets acquired in the transaction

   verisign is engaged in other complaints lawsuits and investigations arising
in the ordinary course of business verisign believes that it has adequate
legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a
material effect on verisigns consolidated financial position and results of
operations

note 10 segment information

 description of segments

   subsequent to its acquisition of network solutions in june 2000 verisign
organized its business into two reportable operating segments the mass markets
division and the enterprise and service provider division the segments were
determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker codm
views and evaluates verisigns operations other factors including customer
base homogeneity of products technology and delivery channels were also
considered in determining the reportable segments verisign measures segment
performance based on gross margin

   the mass markets division provides domain name registration digital
certificate and payment services and other valueadded services to small and
medium sized companies as well as to individual consumers the enterprise and
service provider division provides similar products and services to larger
enterprises and service providers who want to establish and deliver secure
internetbased services for their customers in both businesstoconsumer and
businesstobusiness environments in 2000 verisigns results prior to its
acquisition of network solutions are included in the enterprise and service
provider division

   in 1999 and 1998 verisign operated in a single reportable segment and
derived substantially all of its revenues from sales of internetbased trust
services

   the accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are
generally the same as those described in note 1 description of business and
summary of significant accounting policies internal revenue and gross margin
include transactions between segments that are intended to reflect an arms
length transfer at the best price available for comparable external customers

   the following table reflects the results of verisigns reportable segments
under verisigns management system the performance of each segment is measured
based on several metrics including gross margin these results are used in
part by management in evaluating the performance of and in allocating
resources to each of the segments

formed a special committee of the board to conduct an investigation into
critical paths revenue recognition practices critical path stated that it had
discovered a number of transactions that called into question its financial
results on february 15 2001 critical path restated its financial results for
the fourth quarter of 2000 and made changes in its management as a result of
these developments we will evaluate our investment in critical path during the
first quarter of 2001 in order to determine if there is an other than temporary
impairment of the investment if the decline in the fair value of the
investment is determined to be other than temporary verisign would record a
writeoff of approximately 218 million based on the market price of critical

suit are rsa security inc first data corporation openwave systems inc and
omnisky corporation the complaint alleges that verisigns secure site service
and that its payflow products infringe two us patents the complaint seeks
judgment declaring that the defendants have infringed the asserted claims of
the patentsinsuit preliminary and permanent injunctions against the
defendants from infringing the asserted claims an order requiring the
defendants to pay damages to compensate for the alleged infringement and
treble damages for any willful infringement as well as attorney fees and costs
