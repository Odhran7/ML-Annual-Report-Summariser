 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management  integrated framework 2017 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic risks 

adverse changes in macroeconomic or industry conditions may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced canceled or delayed orders payment delays or defaults supply chain disruptions or other adverse events as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to changes in levels of production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns arise companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

as a global company operating in over 100 countries we face risks related to foreign currency markets a strengthening us dollar usd may adversely impact our sales and profitability related to business we do outside the us 

oil  gas is a major industry that we serve including through our sensia joint venture when adverse oil  gas industry events arise companies may reduce their levels of spending which could result in decreased demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks including those related to commodity prices supply and demand dynamics production costs geological and political activities and environmental regulations including those intended to reduce the impact of climate change 

increases in energy demand and supply disruptions caused by the russia and ukraine conflict have resulted in significantly higher energy prices particularly in europe persistent high energy prices and the potential for further supply disruptions including rationing may have an adverse impact on industrial output and could reduce demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services in europe 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters including those as a result of climate change pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts of war including the russia and ukraine conflict terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations the duration and severity of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world natural disasters including but not limited to those as a result of climate change pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts or threats of war including the russia and ukraine conflict or terrorism international conflicts power outages fires explosions equipment failures sabotage political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability disruptions to our information technology it infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures and other events including disruptions at thirdparty it and other service providers could also interfere with or disrupt our operations although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products solutions or services increase our costs or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products solutions or services 

the covid19 pandemic continues to cause disruption to the global economy including in all of the regions in which we our suppliers distributors business partners and customers do business and in which our workforce is located we continue to monitor the pandemic and while periodic local increases and decreases in covid19 cases are likely generally the restrictions due to and in response to the pandemic continue to relax in most locations however the covid19 pandemic and efforts to manage it including those by governmental authorities have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the economy and our business in many ways this includes but is not limited to a continued limit on the movement of goods services and to some extent people including our own workforce resulting in worldwide disruptions in our supply chain and distribution adverse impacts to our customers’ business operations and financial condition could lead to a decrease in their liquidity andor spending resulting in a decrease in demand for and our customers’ ability to pay for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic make the duration and severity of its impacts difficult to predict which could limit our ability to respond to those impacts additionally the impacts described above and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic and responses to it could substantially increase the risk to us from the other risks described in this item 1a risk factors  

volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in increased costs to maintain our capital structure 

our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation the domain expertise of our employees and partners product performance quality of our hardware and software products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments we seek to maintain competitive pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems in addition we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure if we fail to achieve our objectives to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality hardware and software products solutions and services we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

business and operational risks 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products electronic components and commodities our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

• shortages of components commodities or other materials which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery of our products solutions and services 

• changes in the cost of these purchases due to inflation exchange rate fluctuations taxes tariffs commodity market volatility or other factors that affect our suppliers 

• poor quality or an insecure supply chain which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our hardware and software products solutions and services 

• embargoes sanctions and other trade restrictions that may affect our ability to purchase from various suppliers and 

• intellectual property risks such as challenges to ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliers 

any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability of or delivery delays for singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales 

our business success depends on attracting developing and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our management team and employees the skills experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance the market for employees and leaders with certain skills and experiences is very competitive and difficulty attracting developing and retaining members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition maintaining a positive and inclusive culture and work environment offering attractive compensation benefits and development opportunities and effectively implementing processes and technology that enable our employees to work effectively and efficiently are important to our ability to attract and retain employees 

we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 100 countries around the world in addition our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world less than half of our total sales in 2022 were to customers outside the us the future success of our business depends on growth in our sales in all global markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to exports imports tariffs embargoes and other trade restrictions including sanctions placed on russia investments taxation product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates the occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more difficult to operate our business and may increase our costs which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

failures or security breaches of our products connected services manufacturing environment supply chain or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on technology in our hardware and software products solutions and services for our customers’ manufacturing environment and in our enterprise infrastructure despite the implementation of security measures our systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors who may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information or sabotage our systems could be compromised by malware including ransomware cyber attacks and other events ranging from widespread nontargeted global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats given that our hardware and software products solutions and services are used in critical infrastructure these threats could indicate increased risk for our products services solutions manufacturing and it infrastructure past global cyber attacks have also been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widelyused software products increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products in some cases malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections 

our hardware and software products solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft tampering sabotage or cyberattacks careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property while we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products solutions and services we can reduce risk not eliminate it to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed installed protected configured updated and monitored and much of this is typically outside our control in addition both software and hardware supply chains introduce security vulnerabilities into many products across the industry 

our business uses technology resources on a dispersed global basis for a wide variety of functions including development engineering manufacturing sales accounting and human resources our vendors partners employees and customers have access to and share information across multiple locations via various digital technologies in addition we rely on partners and vendors including cloud providers for a wide range of products and outsourced activities as part of our internal it infrastructure and our commercial offerings secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations also our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers employees and others we design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners’ infrastructure for example a cloud platform could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks in addition our thirdparty risk program manages risk posed by our suppliers that have access to our confidential information systems or network but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business and information 

the current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies including those in industrial automation and information like other global companies we have experienced cyber threats and incidents although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition our information security efforts under the leadership of our chief information security officer and chief product security officer with the support of the entire management team include major programs designed to address security governance and risk product security identification and protection of critical assets insider risk thirdparty risk security awareness and cyber defense operations we believe these measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends demand for our products could decline 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales 

in north america a large percentage of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors we depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products solutions and services and deliver value to our customers disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products solutions and services could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights including as a result of counterfeit products and sales made by unauthorized resellers may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

increasing employee benefit costs and funding requirements could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses and funding requirements expenses and funding requirements related to employerfunded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations which could change as well as healthcare cost inflation an inability to control costs and funding requirements related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

strategic transactions and investments risks 

failure to identify manage complete and integrate strategic transactions may adversely affect our business or we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions 

as part of our strategy we pursue strategic transactions including acquisitions joint ventures investments and other business opportunities and purchases of technology from third parties in order to be successful we must identify attractive transaction opportunities effectively complete the transaction and manage postclosing matters such as integration of the acquired business or technology including related personnel and cooperation with our joint venture and other strategic partners we may not be able to identify or complete beneficial transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them completing these transactions requires favorable environments and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions and we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions including 

• difficulties in integrating the purchased or new operations technologies products or services retaining customers and achieving the expected benefits of the transaction such as sales increases access to technologies cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence in the desired time frames 

• loss of key employees or difficulties integrating personnel 

• legal and compliance issues 

• unknown or undisclosed and unmitigated cyber risks to purchased systems products and services 

• difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards financial systems internal and other controls procedures policies and information systems 

• difficulties maintaining relationships with our joint venture and other strategic partners including as a result of such joint venture and other strategic partners having differing business objectives and managing disputes with such joint venture and other strategic partners that may arise in connection with our relationships with them and 

• difficulties in yielding the desired strategic or financial benefit from venture capital investments including as a result of being a minority investor or macroeconomic conditions 

strategic transactions and technology investments could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and impairment and amortization expenses related to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

we own common stock in ptc inc and are exposed to the volatility liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock 

we own common stock of ptc inc ptc a nasdaqlisted company we present this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period the fair value of our shares of ptc common stock ptc shares is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market changes in general economic conditions and the performance of ptc we recognize all changes in the fair value of the ptc shares whether realized or unrealized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations accordingly changes in the fair value of the ptc shares can materially impact the earnings we report which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations in particular significant declines in the fair value of the ptc shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings 

while there is an established trading market for shares of ptc common stock there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the ptc shares should we wish to reduce our investment until september 2023 we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the ptc shares subject to certain exceptions in addition we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the ptc shares under the securities laws if we were forced to sell some or all of the ptc shares in the market there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the ptc shares that we have reported on our consolidated balance sheet and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 

finally our equity position in ptc is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over ptc 

legal tax and regulatory risks 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action including those related to corporate income taxes the environment materials products certification and labeling privacy cybersecurity or climate change may be taken in the jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities or may otherwise increase our costs to do business 

in october 2021 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and g20 finance ministers reached an agreement that among other things ensures that income earned in each jurisdiction that a multinational enterprise operates in is subject to a minimum corporate income tax rate of at least 15 discussions related to the formal implementation of this agreement including within the tax law of each member jurisdiction including the united states are ongoing enactment of this regulation in its current form would increase the amount of global corporate income tax paid by the company 

we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification and labeling laws and regulations including the emerging european union ecodesign for sustainable products regulation our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

compliance with privacy and cybersecurity regulations could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data personal information and it infrastructure failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm 

in addition increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change may result in more requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards such as more prescriptive reporting of environmental social and governance metrics there continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards which creates uncertainty while the company has adopted certain voluntary targets environmental laws regulations or standards may be changed accelerated or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company its products or customers which could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations and financial condition 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business or of our divested businesses including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits 

our operations are subject to various environmental regulations concerning human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and water the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so

attracting developing and retaining highly qualified talent 

at rockwell automation we promise to expand human possibility within our company and throughout the world of industrial production and we work to attract and develop highly engaged people who can and want to do their best work 

our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion starts at the top our 11 board members include three female and two african american directors in fiscal 2021 we hired our first chief diversity officer and made investments to accelerate our efforts to increase diversity equity and inclusion across the company 

a culture of integrity is fundamental to rockwell’s core values including a formal ethics and compliance organization and an ombuds office that investigates ethical and legal concerns brought forth by employees our code of conduct along with our partner code of conduct and supplier code of conduct prohibits corrupt acts bribery and anticompetitive behavior employee training is used to reinforce our values companywide with participation in trainings related to ethics environment health and safety and emergency responses at or near 100 

there are several ways in which we attract develop and retain highly qualified talent including 

• we make the safety and health of our employees a top priority we strive for zero workplace injuries and illnesses and operate in a manner that recognizes safety as fundamental to rockwell automation being a great place to work in fiscal 2022 we achieved 038 recordable cases per 100 employees 

• we capture and act upon employee feedback through our annual employee engagement survey it measures several engagement indicators and drivers and provides an overall employee engagement index eei with external benchmark comparison the latest survey conducted in march 2022 showed an eei of 76 which was equal to a global norm for this index our global inclusion index score was 77 two points higher than the global benchmark of 75 

• we invest in growth and development of our employees as the pace of change increases it is important we provide reskilling and upskilling opportunities for our technical talent along with soft skills and leadership development for all we offer a portfolio of all employee managerial and leader training that spans ondemand virtual and live instructorled formats our programs focus on basic as well as transformational skills we take pride in our culture and in fiscal 2021 created an opportunity for our employees to participate in teambased culture workshops in fiscal 2022 the majority of our employees completed one or more of our training programs representing over 500000 learning hours 

• we offer employee assistance and work life benefits to all global employees our comprehensive benefits include healthcare benefits disability and life insurance benefits paid time off and leave programs rockwell offers plans and resources to help employees meet future savings goals through defined benefit and retirement savings plans we offer flextime remote work and parttime arrangements whenever business conditions permit we believe that face to face interaction is critical for our culture innovation people development and engagement and that flexible virtual work arrangements help employees be more productive and engaged during fiscal 2022 we launched our hybrid workplace program which combines the values of both physical workspaces and virtual work options both of which are important for attracting retaining and developing talent and facilitating innovation engagement and productivity 

we monitor employee retention and attrition rates by demographic factors including by gender ethnicity generation years of service career role region business and function we generally experienced higher attrition rates in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 we believe the increase is consistent with market trends experienced broadly across labor markets in fiscal 2022 we use attrition rate information to identify and address unfavorable trends to mitigate risk to our business see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of risks relating to our inability to attract develop and retain highly qualified talent 

at september 30 2022 our employees including those employed by consolidated subsidiaries by region were approximately 



our employees had the following global gender demographics based on voluntary disclosure 



our us employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics based on voluntary disclosure 



continuous improvement 

productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

us economic trends 

in 2022 sales in the us accounted for over half of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

• the industrial production ip index published by the federal reserve which measures the real output of manufacturing mining and electric and gas utilities the ip index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year currently 2017 historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the ip index and the level of automation investment made by our us customers in their manufacturing base 

• the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index pmi published by the institute for supply management ism which indicates the current and nearterm state of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism a pmi measure above 50 indicates that the us manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting 

the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2020 to 2022 these figures are as of november 8 2022 and are subject to revision by the issuing organizations the ip index rose 05 a slower rate of acceleration in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2022 the us manufacturing sector continued to expand in the fourth quarter with pmi remaining above 50 however this is the lowest rate since the pandemic recovery began reflecting an easing of demand 



during 2022 inflation in the us has had an impact on our input costs and pricing the producer price index ppi published by the bureau of labor statistics measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output ppi for september 30 2022 june 30 2022 march 31 2022 and december 31 2021 increased 85 percent 113 percent 117 percent and 100 percent respectively compared to september 30 2021 june 30 2021 march 31 2021 and december 31 2020 these figures are as of november 8 2022 and are subject to revision by the issuing organization 

nonus economic trends 

in 2022 sales to customers outside the us accounted for less than half of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with a global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the overview section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in key countries gross domestic product gdp ip and pmi as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business industrial output outside the us was mixed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 

global gdp forecasts are mixed with europe middle east and africa and latin america projected to see slowing growth from 2022 to 2023 and asia projected to see flat to slightly higher growth supply chain disruptions labor shortages and global inflation are expected to remain persistent in 2023 along with elevated geopolitical instability 

supply chain 

we have a global supply chain including a network of suppliers and manufacturing and distribution facilities the supply chain is stressed by increased demand along with pandemicrelated and other global events that have put additional pressures on manufacturing output and freight lanes this has resulted in and could continue to result in 

• disruptions in our supply chain 

• difficulty in procuring or inability to procure components and materials necessary for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

• increased costs for commodities components and freight services and 

• delays in delivering or an inability to deliver our hardware and software products solutions and services 

our total order backlog consists of in millions 



see note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the nature of our products and services and revenue recognition 

we are closely managing our endtoend supply chain from sourcing to production to customer delivery with a particular focus on all critical and atrisk suppliers and supplier locations globally we have made largescale investments to increase capacity across our network in support of our orders growth additional actions we are taking include 

• extending order visibility to our supply base to ensure we are appropriately planning for extended component lead times 

• securing longerterm supply agreements with critical partners 

• reengineering of existing products to increase component supply resiliency 

• capacity investments including redundant manufacturing lines and additional electronic assembly equipment and 

• qualification of additional suppliers to diversify our supplier base 

we believe these and other actions we are taking will over time normalize our product lead times and reduce our backlog 

covid19 pandemic 

we continue to monitor the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies uncertainty on the duration and severity of those impacts remains due to the evolving nature of the pandemic government responses to it and regulations across the geographies in which our business operates we are continuously responding to the changing conditions created by the pandemic and evolving regulations and remain focused on our priorities including employee health and safety our customer needs and protecting critical investments to drive longterm differentiation

supplemental segment information 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit credit cost are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment’s operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to rockwell automation change in fair value of investments and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests including their respective tax effects nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost is defined as all components of our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost except for service cost see note 14 in the consolidated financial statements for more information on our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost 

we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for net income attributable to rockwell automation diluted eps and effective tax rate 

the following are reconciliations of net income attributable to rockwell automation diluted eps and effective tax rate to adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate respectively in millions except per share amounts and percentages 



1 primarily relates to the change in fair value of investment in ptc 



1 the year ended september 30 2022 included a loss on investment of 1369 million primarily due to the change in fair value of investment in ptc fiscal 2023 guidance excludes estimates of these adjustments on a forwardlooking basis due to variability complexity and limited visibility of these items 

2 fiscal 2023 guidance based on adjusted income attributable to rockwell which includes an adjustment for slbs noncontrolling interest in sensia 

organic annual recurring revenue 

arr is a key metric that enables measurement of progress in growing our recurring revenue business it represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual typically for a period of 12 months or more and has a high probability of renewal the probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams or managements best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available organic arr growth is calculated as the dollar change in arr adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions divided by arr as of the prior period the effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating organic arr on a constant currency basis when we acquire businesses we exclude the effect of arr in the current period for which there was no comparable arr in the prior period organic arr growth is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation because arr is based on annual contract value it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue contract liabilities or backlog 

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure in millions 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy cash provided by operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations if any operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations if any are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 8231 million for the year ended september 30 2022 compared to 12610 million for the year ended september 30 2021 free cash flow was 6820 million for the year ended september 30 2022 compared to 11407 million for the year ended september 30 2021 the yearoveryear decreases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to increases in working capital including higher receivables and inventory to support business growth and higher incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 supply chain constraints have also negatively impacted our working capital efficiency 

we repurchased approximately 13 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2022 at a total cost of 3011 million and an average cost of 22305 per share in 2021 we repurchased approximately 11 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of 3014 million and an average cost of 26343 per share at september 30 2022 there were 16 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2023 at september 30 2021 there were 18 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2022 our decision to repurchase shares in 2023 will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price on both july 24 2019 and may 2 2022 the board of directors authorized us to expend an additional 10 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock at september 30 2022 we had approximately 12513 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations see item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses and other inorganic investments dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2023 to be approximately 190 million significant longterm uses of cash include the following in millions 



1 the amounts for longterm debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates and include interest but exclude unamortized discount see note 7 in the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our longterm debt 

2 our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and are subject to change amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments to the extent estimable 

3 amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates contributions to our pension plans beyond 2023 will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time amounts subsequent to 2023 are excluded from the summary above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of these amounts the minimum contribution for our us pension plan as required by the employee retirement income security act erisa is currently zero we may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management 

4 under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” the company may elect to pay the transition tax interestfree over eight years with 8 due in each of the first five years 15 in year six 20 in year seven and 25 in year eight 

we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities in addition we have access to unsecured credit facilities with various banks 

at september 30 2022 the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held by nonus subsidiaries as a result of the broad changes to the us international tax system under the tax act we account for taxes on earnings of substantially all of our nonus subsidiaries including both nonus and us taxes we have concluded that earnings of a limited number of our nonus subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested 

our shortterm debt as of september 30 2022 and 2021 includes commercial paper borrowings of 3170 million and 4840 million respectively with weighted average interest rates of 303 percent and 018 percent respectively and weighted average maturity periods of 22 days and 90 days respectively also included in shortterm debt as of september 30 2022 and 2021 are 423 million and 235 million respectively of interestbearing loans from slb to sensia due in december 2022 

in august 2021 we issued 15 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm notes in a registered public offering the offering consisted of 6000 million of 035 notes due in august 2023 4500 million of 175 notes due in august 2031 and 4500 million of 280 notes due in august 2061 all issued at a discount net proceeds to the company from the debt offering were 14856 million we used these net proceeds primarily to fund the acquisition of plex refer to note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition 

in march 2019 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm notes in a registered public offering the offering consisted of 4250 million of 350 notes due in march 2029 and 5750 million of 420 notes due in march 2049 both issued at a discount net proceeds to the company from the debt offering were 9876 million we used these net proceeds primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes 

we entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of the 15 billion aggregate notes in august 2021 and the 10 billion of fixed rate debt in march 2019 these treasury locks were designated as and accounted for as cash flow hedges the effective differentials paid on these treasury locks was initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax effect as a result of the changes in the interest rates on the treasury locks between the time we entered into the treasury locks and the time we priced and issued the notes the company made a net payment of 280 million to the counterparties from the august 2021 issuance and 357 million to the counterparty from the march 2019 issuance the 280 million and 357 million net losses on the settlement of the treasury locks were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax effect and are being amortized over the term of the corresponding notes and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

in april 2020 we entered into a 4000 million senior unsecured 364day term loan credit agreement and were advanced the full loan amount interest on these borrowings was based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings were outstanding we repaid the 4000 million term loan in september 2020 

on june 29 2022 we replaced our former 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new fiveyear 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in june 2027 we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 7500 million subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we did not borrow against this credit facility or the former credit facility during the periods ended september 30 2022 and 2021 borrowings under our new 15 billion credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of this credit facility contain covenants under which we agree to maintain an ebitdatointerest ratio of at least 30 to 10 the ebitdatointerest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period 

libor was the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under our former 125 billion credit facility our new 15 billion credit facility uses the secured overnight funding rate sofr as the primary basis for determining interest payments 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 2141 million at september 30 2022 were available to nonus subsidiaries of which approximately 300 million was committed under letters of credit borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2022 and 2021 were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2022 and 2021 there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under our credit facilities 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of the additional leverage added to fund the plex acquisition standard  poor’s elected to downgrade our outlook from “stable” to “negative” no changes were made to existing ratings by moody’s or fitch the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2022 



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

on december 10 2021 the company entered a 10b51 plan related to our ptc shares pursuant to which a broker will make periodic sales of some of our ptc shares on behalf of the company subject to the terms of the plan starting in june 2022 the company made periodic sales of our ptc shares in the open market outside of the parameters of the existing 10b51 plan all of our sales of ptc are consistent with the transfer restrictions in the securities purchase agreement as amended with ptc as of september 30 2022 the fiscal yeartodate sales of our ptc shares under our 10b51 plan and open market sales resulted in a gross inflow of 2024 million this excludes any tax liability related to the realized gain on investment these proceeds and any proceeds from future sales will support our future uses of cash 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities’ functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends declared to shareowners were 5208 million in 2022 448 per common share 4975 million in 2021 428 per common share and 4728 million in 2020 408 per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2022 is 112 per common share 448 per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we divest a business we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year excluding divestitures we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales by geographic region in millions 





the following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales by operating segment in millions 





critical accounting estimates 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported these estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions but actual results could differ from those estimates refer to note 1 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies 

goodwill  sensia reporting unit 

the quantitative test of goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 we performed our annual quantitative impairment test for our sensia reporting unit as a result of ongoing supply chain constraints and market volatility we identified a triggering event in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 for our sensia reporting unit which required an interim quantitative impairment test we determined the fair value of the reporting unit for both tests under a combination of an income approach derived from discounted cash flows and a market multiples approach using selected comparable public companies 

critical assumptions used in this approach included management’s estimated future revenue growth rates estimated future margins and discount rate estimated future revenue growth and margins are based on management’s best estimate about current and future conditions the revenue growth rate assumption reflects significant growth over the next five years before moderating back to a growth rate approximating longer term average inflationary rates the forecasted nearterm growth rate assumes that revenue will return to prepandemic levels due to the abatement of pandemicrelated disruptions margin assumptions reflect that the cost pressure in the current year related to inflation and supply chain challenges will be compensated through pricing achieved on future orders we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate which are based on a number of factors including historical experience reference to external product available market and industry growth publications analysis of peer group projections and information obtained from reporting unit management including backlog actual results and forecasts of revenue growth and margins for our sensia reporting unit may be impacted by its concentration within the oil  gas industry and with its customer base demand for sensia hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks including those related to commodity prices supply and demand dynamics production costs geological activity and political activities if such factors impact our ability to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates and margins the fair value of the reporting unit could decrease which may result in an impairment we determined the discount rate using our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors including risk associated with our above market revenue growth assumptions historical performance and industryspecific and economic factors 

based on these assumptions and estimates the fair value of the sensia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 20 percent in the second quarter and approximately 15 percent in the fourth quarter therefore we deemed that no impairment existed during the year ended september 30 2022 on 3159 million of goodwill allocated to the sensia reporting unit 

more information regarding goodwill impairment testing is contained in note 1 and note 3 in the consolidated financial statements 

retirement benefits  pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2022 was 744 million compared to 1570 million in 2021 approximately all of our 2022 global pension expense and 76 percent of our global projected benefit obligation relate to our us pension plan the discount rate used to determine our 2022 us pension expense was 386 percent compared to 290 percent for 2021 

for 2023 our us discount rate will increase to 565 percent from 386 percent in 2022 the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

the changes in our discount rate has an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the discount rate for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 14 in the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  customer incentives 

we offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional hardware and software products solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits we record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within customer returns rebates and incentives in our consolidated balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of receivables customer incentives for additional hardware and software products solutions and services to be provided are considered distinct performance obligations as such we allocate revenue to them based on relative standalone selling price until the incentive is redeemed the revenue is recorded as a contract liability 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed our estimate is based primarily on historical experience if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 257 million 

more information regarding our revenue recognition and returns rebates and incentives policies are contained in note 1 and note 2 in the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions  plex intangible assets valuation 

the accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the identifiable assets of the acquired entity any unallocated portion is recognized as goodwill we engaged an independent thirdparty valuation specialist to assist with the fair value allocation of the purchase price paid for the acquisition of plex to intangible assets this required the use of several assumptions and estimates including the customer attrition rate forecasted cash flows attributable to existing customers and the discount rate for the customer relationship intangible asset and the royalty rate forecasted revenue growth rates and the discount rate for the technology intangible asset although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates require judgment and are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from plex management 

the key assumption requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset was the customer attrition rate of 5 percent this rate was selected based on historical experience and information obtained from plex management a change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a change of 63 million in intangible assets the key assumptions requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the technology intangible asset were the royalty rate of 25 percent and the obsolescence factor the royalty rate was based on a detailed analysis considering the importance of the technology to the overall enterprise and market royalty data a change in the royalty rate of 500 basis points would result in a change of 47 million in intangible assets the obsolescence factor was calculated assuming phase out over ten years based on discussions with plex management the nature of the technology its integration into customers’ manufacturing systems and other thirdparty information for similar transactions a twoyear change in this assumption would result in a change of 52 million in intangible assets 

more information regarding this business combination is contained in note 4 in the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions  sensia joint venture intangible assets valuation 

we recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the formation of sensia based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of october 1 2019 the accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the identifiable assets of the acquired entity any unallocated portion is recognized as goodwill we engaged an independent thirdparty valuation specialist to assist with the fair value allocation of the purchase price paid in connection with formation of the sensia joint venture to intangible assets which required the use of several assumptions and estimates although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from sensia management the key assumption requiring the use of judgment was the customer attrition rates ranging from 75 percent to 25 percent a change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a change of 404 million in intangible assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 1201 million and a liability of 322 million at september 30 2022 we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies has an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to current levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 351 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2022 2021 or 2020 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt as of september 30 2022 and 2021 includes commercial paper borrowings of 3170 million and 4840 million respectively with weighted average interest rates of 303 percent and 018 percent respectively and weighted average maturity periods of 22 days and 90 days respectively also included in shortterm debt as of september 30 2022 and 2021 is 423 million and 235 million respectively of interestbearing loans from slb to sensia due in december 2022 we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our shortterm debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm and current portion of longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 34769 million at september 30 2022 and 34714 million at september 30 2021 the fair value of this debt was approximately 30745 million at september 30 2022 and 38816 million at september 30 2021 the potential increase in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management  integrated framework 2017 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic risks 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters including those as a result of climate change pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations the duration and severity of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world natural disasters including but not limited to those as a result of climate change pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts power outages fires explosions equipment failures sabotage political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability disruptions to our it infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures and other events including disruptions at third party it and other service providers could also interfere with or disrupt our operations although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products solutions or services increase our costs or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products solutions or services 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy including in all of the regions in which we our suppliers distributors business partners and customers do business and in which our workforce is located the covid19 pandemic and efforts to manage it including those by governmental authorities have had and could continue to have significant impacts on global markets while the duration and severity of those impacts on our business are highly uncertain they have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in many ways including but not limited to the following 

• the covid19 pandemic and responses to it have significantly limited or prevented the movement of goods and services worldwide which has resulted in and could continue to result in disruptions in our supply chain and our difficulty in procuring or inability to procure components and materials necessary for our hardware and software products solutions and services the impact of the covid19 pandemic and responses to it has increased and could continue to increase the costs of making and distributing our hardware and software products solutions and services or result in delays in delivering or an inability to deliver them to our customers 

• our workforce may be unable or unwilling to work onsite or travel as a result of vaccine requirements event cancellations facility closures shelterinplace travel and other restrictions and changes in industry practice or if they their coworkers or their family members become ill or otherwise require care arrangements regulations for vaccines and covid19 testing have been announced and additional regulations may be announced in the jurisdictions in which our business operates these workforce disruptions and regulations have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our ability to efficiently operate including to develop manufacture generate sales of promote market and deliver our hardware and software products solutions and services and provide customer support implementation of new regulations for vaccines may result in attrition of skilled labor and impact our ability to attract and retain talent necessary for our business operations for additional information see the risk factor on attracting developing and retaining highly qualified personnel 

• our customers are and continue to be subject to significant risks and have had and could continue to have adverse impacts to their business operations and financial condition related to the covid19 pandemic which could lead to a decrease in their liquidity andor industrial spending this has resulted in and could continue to result in a decrease in demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services as well as impact our customers’ ability to pay for such hardware and software products solutions and services 

the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic make the duration and severity of its impacts difficult to predict which could limit our ability to respond to those impacts additionally the impacts described above and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic and responses to it could substantially increase the risk to us from the other risks described in this item 1a risk factors  

adverse changes in macroeconomic or industry conditions may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced canceled or delayed orders payment delays or defaults supply chain disruptions or other adverse events as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns arise companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

oil  gas is a major industry that we serve demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks including those related to commodity prices supply and demand dynamics productions costs geological and political activities and environmental regulations including those intended to reduce the impact of climate change when adverse oil  gas industry events arise companies may reduce their levels of spending which could result in decreased demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in increased costs to maintain our capital structure 

our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

the london interbank offered rate libor is the basis for determining the amount of our interest payments on borrowings under our 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to phase out libor banks currently reporting information used to set us dollar libor are currently expected to stop doing so during 2023 various parties including government agencies are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace libor if libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain agreements that use libor as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected additionally uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance or modification of libor alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially and adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks for additional information see financial condition in item 7 mda  

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation the domain expertise of our employees and partners product performance quality of our hardware and software products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments we seek to maintain competitive pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems in addition we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure if we fail to achieve our objectives to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality hardware and software products solutions and services we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

business and operational risks 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products electronic components and commodities our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

• shortages of components commodities or other materials which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery of our products solutions and services 

• changes in the cost of these purchases due to inflation exchange rate fluctuations taxes tariffs commodity market volatility or other factors that affect our suppliers 

• poor quality or an insecure supply chain which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our hardware and software products solutions and services 

• embargoes sanctions and other trade restrictions that may affect our ability to purchase from various suppliers and 

• intellectual property risks such as challenges to ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliers 

any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability of or delivery delays for singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales 

our business success depends on attracting developing and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees and the effective implementation of processes and technology to increase employee engagement productivity and efficiency the skills experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance difficulty attracting developing and retaining members of our management team and key employees with the necessary expertise including by offering attractive compensation benefits and development opportunities could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition we continuously evaluate modify and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement productivity and efficiency and to mitigate failure risks from older technologies currently in use failure to identify and successfully implement new processes and technologies could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and negatively impact employee engagement productivity and efficiency 

we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 100 countries around the world less than half of our total sales in 2021 were to customers outside the us in addition our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to exports imports tariffs embargoes and other trade restrictions investments taxation product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates the occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more difficult to operate our business and may increase our costs which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

failures or security breaches of our products connected services manufacturing environment supply chain or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it in our hardware and software products solutions and services for customers manufacturing environment and in our enterprise infrastructure despite the implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors who may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information or sabotage our systems could be compromised by malware including ransomware cyber attacks and other events ranging from widespread nontargeted global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats given that our hardware and software products solutions and services are used in critical infrastructure these threats could indicate increased risk for our products services solutions manufacturing and it infrastructure past global cyber attacks have also been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widelyused software products increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products in some cases malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections 

our hardware and software products solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft tampering sabotage or cyberattacks careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property while we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products solutions and services we can reduce risk not eliminate it to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed installed protected configured updated and monitored and much of this is typically outside our control in addition the software supply chain introduces security vulnerabilities into many products across the industry 

our business uses it resources on a dispersed global basis for a wide variety of functions including development engineering manufacturing sales accounting and human resources our vendors partners employees and customers have access to and share information across multiple locations via various digital technologies in addition we rely on partners and vendors including cloud providers for a wide range of products and outsourced activities as part of our internal it infrastructure and our commercial offerings secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations also our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers employees and others we design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners’ infrastructure for example a cloud platform could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks in addition our third party risk program manages risk posed by our suppliers that have access to our confidential information systems or network but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business and information 

the current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies including those in industrial automation and information like other global companies we have experienced cyber threats and incidents although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition our information security efforts under the leadership of our chief information security officer and chief product security officer with the support of the entire management team include major programs designed to address security governance and risk product security identification and protection of critical assets insider risk thirdparty risk security awareness and cyber defense operations we believe these measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends demand for our products could decline 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales 

in north america a large percentage of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors we depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products solutions and services and deliver value to our customers disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products solutions and services could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

increasing employee benefit costs and funding requirements could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses and funding requirements expenses and funding requirements related to employerfunded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations which could change as well as healthcare cost inflation an inability to control costs and funding requirements related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

strategic transactions and investments risks 

failure to identify manage complete and integrate strategic transactions may adversely affect our business or we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions 

as part of our strategy we may pursue strategic transactions including acquisitions joint ventures investments other business opportunities and purchases of technology from third parties in order to be successful we must identify attractive transaction opportunities effectively complete the transaction and manage postclosing matters such as integration of the acquired business or technology including related personnel and cooperation with our joint venture and other strategic partners we may not be able to identify or complete beneficial transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions and we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions including 

• difficulties in integrating the purchased or new operations technologies products or services retaining customers and achieving the expected benefits of the transaction such as sales increases access to technologies cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence in the desired time frames 

• loss of key employees or difficulties integrating personnel 

• legal and compliance issues 

• difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards financial systems internal and other controls procedures policies and information systems 

• difficulties maintaining relationships with our joint venture and other strategic partners including as a result of such joint venture and other strategic partners having differing business objectives and managing disputes with such joint venture and other strategic partners that may arise in connection with our relationships with them and 

• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

future strategic transactions and technology investments could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and impairment and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 

we own common stock in ptc inc and are exposed to the volatility liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock 

we own common stock of ptc inc ptc a nasdaqlisted company that we acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10 billion we present this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period the fair value of our shares of ptc common stock ptc shares is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market changes in general economic conditions and the performance of ptc we recognize all changes in the fair value of the ptc shares whether realized or unrealized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations accordingly changes in the fair value of the ptc shares can materially impact the earnings we report which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations in particular significant declines in the fair value of the ptc shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings 

while there is an established trading market for shares of ptc common stock there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the ptc shares should we wish to reduce our investment until september 2023 we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the ptc shares subject to certain exceptions in addition we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the ptc shares under the securities laws further the reported value of the ptc shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price if we were forced to sell some or all of the ptc shares in the market there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the ptc shares that we have reported on our consolidated balance sheet and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 

finally our equity position in ptc is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over ptc 

legal tax and regulatory risks 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action including those related to corporate income taxes or climate change may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in those countries and other jurisdictions or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification and labeling laws and regulations our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services compliance with state federal and foreign privacy regulations such as the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm 

in addition increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change may result in more requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards such as more prescriptive reporting of environmental social and governance metrics there continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards which creates uncertainty while the company has adopted certain voluntary targets environmental laws regulations or standards may be changed accelerated or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company its products or customers which could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations and financial condition 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits 

our operations are subject to various environmental regulations concerning human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and water the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so

attracting developing and retaining highly qualified talent 

at rockwell automation we promise to expand human possibility within our company and throughout the world of industrial production and we work to attract and develop highly engaged people who can and want to do their best work 

our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion starts at the top our 11 board members 10 of whom are independent include three female and two african american directors in fiscal year 2021 we hired our first chief diversity officer and made investments to accelerate our efforts to increase diversity equity and inclusion across the company 

a culture of integrity is fundamental to rockwell’s core values including a formal ethics and compliance organization and an ombuds office that investigates ethical and legal concerns brought forth by employees in fiscal year 2020 we refreshed our code of conduct that along with our partner code of conduct and supplier code of conduct prohibits corrupt acts bribery and anticompetitive behavior employee training is used to reinforce our values companywide with participation in trainings related to ethics environment health and safety and emergency responses at or near 100 

there are several ways in which we attract develop and retain highly qualified talent including 

• we make the safety and health of our employees a top priority we strive for zero workplace injuries and illnesses and operate in a manner that recognizes safety as fundamental to rockwell automation being a great place to work in fiscal year 2021 we achieved 027 recordable cases per 100 employees 

• we capture and act upon employee feedback through our annual employee engagement survey it measures several engagement indicators and drivers and provides an overall employee engagement index eei with external benchmark comparison the latest survey conducted in february 2021 showed an eei of 74 which was equal to a global norm for this index our global inclusion index score was 76 three points higher than the global benchmark of 73 

• we invest in growth and development of our employees as the pace of change increases it is important we provide reskilling and upskilling opportunities for our technical talent along with soft skills and leadership development for all we offer a portfolio of all employee managerial and leader training that spans ondemand selfpaced and virtual live instructorled formats our programs focus on basic as well as transformational skills we take pride in our culture and in fiscal year 2021 created an opportunity for our employees to participate in teambased culture workshops in fiscal 2021 the majority of our employees completed one or more of our training programs representing over 100000 learning hours 

• we offer employee assistance and work life benefits to all global employees our comprehensive benefits include healthcare benefits disability and life insurance benefits paid time off and leave programs rockwell offers plans and resources to help employees meet future savings goals through defined benefit and retirement savings plans we offer flextime remote work and parttime arrangements whenever business conditions permit 

we monitor employee retention and attrition rates by demographic factors including by gender ethnicity generation years of service career role region business and function we generally experienced higher attrition rates in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 we believe the increase is consistent with market trends experienced broadly across labor markets in fiscal 2021 we use attrition rate information to identify and address unfavorable trends to mitigate risk to our business see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of risks relating to our inability to attract develop and retain highly qualified talent 

at september 30 2021 our employees including those employed by consolidated subsidiaries by region were approximately 



our employees had the following global gender demographics 



our us employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics based on voluntary disclosure 



continuous improvement 

productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2021 sales in the us accounted for over half of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

• the industrial production ip index published by the federal reserve which measures the real output of manufacturing mining and electric and gas utilities the ip index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year currently 2017 historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the ip index and the level of automation investment made by our us customers in their manufacturing base 

• the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index pmi published by the institute for supply management ism which indicates the current and nearterm state of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism a pmi measure above 50 indicates that the us manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting 

the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2019 to 2021 these figures are as of the date of this filing and are subject to revision by the issuing organizations the ip index continued to improve during the quarter reaching the prepandemic level in august before declining below that level again in september in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 pmi continues to be well above 50 the september pmi represents the sixteenth consecutive month of expansion in the overall economy 



nonus economic trends 

in 2021 sales to customers outside the us accounted for less than half of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with a global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “overview” section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in key countries gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

industrial output and pmi outside the us was mixed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 industrial output projections for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 are varied with some regions projected to grow sequentially and others projected to contract 

supply chain 

we have a global supply chain including a network of suppliers and distribution and manufacturing facilities the supply chain is stressed by increased demand along with pandemicrelated and other global events that have put additional pressures on manufacturing output and freight lanes this has resulted in and could continue to result in 

• disruptions in our supply chain 

• difficulty in procuring or inability to procure components and materials necessary for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

• increased costs for commodities components and freight services and 

• delays in delivering or an inability to deliver our hardware and software products solutions and services 

we are closely managing our endtoend supply chain from sourcing to production to customer delivery with a particular focus on all critical and atrisk suppliers and supplier locations globally 

covid19 pandemic 

in fiscal 2020 we experienced a significant disruption to our business as a result of the covid19 pandemic which impacted demand for our hardware and software products services and solutions in response to the pandemic we implemented enhanced policies and procedures for employee safety and we implemented temporary cost reduction actions and other adjustments to our cost structure restrictions on physical access to customer manufacturing and office facilities has created and continues to create inefficiencies and execution delays 

we continue to monitor the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies uncertainty on the duration and severity of those impacts remain as new variants of the virus have emerged and the evolving nature of vaccine rollouts and regulations new regulations for vaccines and covid19 testing and health and safety requirements have been announced and additional regulations may be announced in the jurisdictions in which our business operates we are continuously responding to the changing conditions created by the pandemic and evolving regulations and remain focused on our priorities including employee health and safety our customer needs and protecting critical investments to drive longterm differentiation 

we have seen a recovery in demand for our hardware and software products services and solutions during fiscal 2021 allowing us to reverse our temporary cost reduction actions and we expect this to continue into fiscal 2022 we continue to monitor and to respond to the impacts on our businesses from macroeconomic effects including the ongoing impacts of the pandemic supply chain constraints and materials and labor shortages 

outlook 

the table below provides guidance for sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2022 our guidance reflects strong demand as well as record backlog entering into fiscal year 2022 supply chain challenges remain dynamic and our projections assume gradual improvement over the course of the year

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2021 was 119 percent compared to 99 percent in 2020 the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the effect of tax benefits recognized upon the formation of the sensia joint venture in fiscal 2020 and other discrete items the adjusted effective tax rate in 2021 was 116 percent compared to 124 percent in 2020 the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to higher discrete benefits in the current year

supplemental segment information 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost credit are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment’s operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost credit purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to rockwell automation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and gains and losses on investments including their respective tax effects nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost credit is defined as all components of our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost except for service cost see note 14 in the consolidated financial statements for more information on our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost 

beginning in fiscal 2021 we changed our definition of adjusted income and adjusted eps to exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to rockwell automation including the related tax effects the definition of adjusted effective tax rate also changed to correspond to the purchase accounting items now being excluded from adjusted income we believe these new definitions provide more useful information about our operating performance and allow management and investors to better compare our operating performance period over period compared to our prior definitions of these measures given our increased inorganic investments all previously reported amounts within this filing have been recast to conform to this new definition adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for net income attributable to rockwell automation diluted eps and effective tax rate 

the following are reconciliations of net income attributable to rockwell automation diluted eps and effective tax rate to adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate respectively in millions except per share amounts and percentages

organic annual recurring revenue 

arr is a key metric that enables measurement of progress in growing our recurring revenue business it represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual typically for a period of 12 months or more and has a high probability of renewal the probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams or managements best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available organic arr growth is calculated as the dollar change in arr adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions divided by arr as of the prior period the effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating organic arr on a constant currency basis when we acquire businesses we exclude the effect of arr in the current period for which there was no comparable arr in the prior period organic arr growth is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation because arr is based on annual contract value it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue contract liabilities or backlog 

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure in millions 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses’ operations and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations if any operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations if any are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 12610 million for the year ended september 30 2021 compared to 11205 million for the year ended september 30 2020 free cash flow was 11407 million for the year ended september 30 2021 compared to 10066 million for the year ended september 30 2020 the yearoveryear increase in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to higher pretax income including the 70 million favorable legal settlement in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and a decrease in incentive compensation payments partially offset by higher working capital and income tax payments in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

we repurchased approximately 11 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2021 at a total cost of 3014 million and an average cost of 26343 per share in 2020 we repurchased approximately 14 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of 2547 million and an average cost of 18218 per share at september 30 2021 there were 18 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2022 at september 30 2020 there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable our decision to repurchase shares in 2022 will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price on both september 6 2018 and july 24 2019 the board of directors authorized us to expend 10 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock at september 30 2021 we had approximately 5523 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations see item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses and other inorganic investments dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately 165 million significant longterm uses of cash include the following in millions 



a the amounts for longterm debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates and include interest but exclude unamortized discount see note 7 in the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our longterm debt 

b our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and are subject to change amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments to the extent estimable 

c amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates contributions to our pension plans beyond 2022 will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time amounts subsequent to 2022 are excluded from the summary above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of these amounts the minimum contribution for our us pension plan as required by the employee retirement income security act erisa is currently zero we may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management 

d under the tax act the company may elect to pay the transition tax interestfree over eight years with 8 due in each of the first five years 15 in year six 20 in year seven and 25 in year eight 

we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities in addition we have access to unsecured credit facilities with various banks 

at september 30 2021 the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held by nonus subsidiaries as a result of the broad changes to the us international tax system under the tax act in fiscal year 2018 we began to account for substantially all of our nonus subsidiaries as being immediately subject to tax while still concluding that earnings are indefinitely reinvested for a limited number of subsidiaries 

our shortterm debt as of september 30 2021 includes 4840 million of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 018 percent and weighted average maturity period of 90 days there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2020 also included in shortterm debt as of september 30 2021 and 2020 are 235 million of interestbearing loans from schlumberger to sensia which were originally due september 30 2020 and are now due december 31 2021 the shortterm loans from schlumberger were entered into following formation of sensia in fiscal 2020 

in august 2021 we issued 15 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm notes in a registered public offering the offering consisted of 6000 million of 035 notes due in august 2023 4500 million of 175 notes due in august 2031 and 4500 million of 280 notes due in august 2061 all issued at a discount net proceeds to the company from the debt offering were 14856 million we used these net proceeds primarily to fund the acquisition of plex refer to note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition 

we entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of the 15 billion aggregate notes in august 2021 these treasury locks were designated as and accounted for as cash flow hedges as a result of the changes in the interest rates on the treasury locks between the time we entered into the treasury locks and the time we priced and issued the notes the company made a net payment of 280 million to the counterparties the 280 million net loss on the settlement of the treasury locks was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax effect and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding notes as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

in april 2020 we entered into a 4000 million senior unsecured 364day term loan credit agreement and were advanced the full loan amount interest on these borrowings was based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings were outstanding we repaid the 4000 million term loan in september 2020 

in march 2019 we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm notes in a registered public offering the offering consisted of 4250 million of 350 notes due in march 2029 “2029 notes” and 5750 million of 420 notes due in march 2049 “2049 notes” both issued at a discount net proceeds to the company from the debt offering were 9876 million we used these net proceeds primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes 

we entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of 10 billion of fixed rate debt in march 2019 treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges the effective differentials paid on these treasury locks was initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax effect 

as a result of the changes in the interest rates on the treasury locks between the time we entered into the treasury locks and the time we priced and issued the 2029 notes and 2049 notes the company made a payment of 357 million to the counterparty on march 1 2019 the 357 million loss on the settlement of the treasury locks was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the 2029 notes and 2049 notes and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

on november 13 2018 we replaced our former fiveyear 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new fiveyear 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in november 2023 we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 7500 million subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the former credit facility we did not borrow against the facility during the periods ended september 30 2021 or 2020 borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding this credit facility contains covenants under which we agree to maintain an ebitdatointerest ratio of at least 30 to 10 the ebitdatointerest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period 

libor is the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under our 125 billion credit facility banks currently reporting information used to set us dollar libor are currently expected to stop doing so during 2023 various parties including government agencies are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace libor we are monitoring their efforts and we will likely seek to amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where one is not already provided 

separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 2308 million at september 30 2021 were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2021 and 2020 were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2021 and 2020 there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under our credit facilities 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of the additional leverage added to fund the plex acquisition standard  poor’s elected to downgrade our outlook from “stable” to “negative” no changes were made to existing ratings by moody’s or fitch the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2021 



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions conditions in the commercial paper market have improved since the covid19 pandemic negatively affected this market in march and april 2020 and we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities’ functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends declared to shareowners were 4975 million in 2021 428 per common share 4728 million in 2020 408 per common share and 4598 million in 2019 388 per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2021 is 107 per common share 428 per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we divest a business we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year excluding divestitures we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales in millions 





the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales in millions 





critical accounting estimates 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported these estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions but actual results could differ from those estimates refer to note 1 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies 

goodwill  sensia reporting unit 

the quantitative test of goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units during the second quarter of 2021 we performed a quantitative impairment test for our sensia reporting unit we determined the fair value of the reporting unit under a combination of an income approach derived from discounted cash flows and a market multiples approach using selected comparable public companies 

critical assumptions used in this approach included management’s estimated future revenue growth rates estimated future margins and discount rate estimated future revenue growth and margins are based on management’s best estimate about current and future conditions although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates are based on a number of factors including historical experience and information obtained from reporting unit management actual results and forecasts of revenue growth and margins for our sensia reporting unit may be impacted by its concentration within the oil  gas industry and with its customer base demand for sensia hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks including those related to commodity prices supply and demand dynamics production costs geological activity and political activities we determined the discount rate using our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors specific to the reporting unit with comparison to market and industry data a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the fair value of this reporting unit would not impact our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired 

more information regarding goodwill impairment testing is contained in note 1 and note 3 in the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions  plex intangible assets valuation 

the accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the identifiable assets of the acquired entity any unallocated portion is recognized as goodwill we engaged an independent thirdparty valuation specialist to assist with the fair value allocation of the purchase price paid for the acquisition of plex to intangible assets this required the use of several assumptions and estimates including the customer attrition rate forecasted cash flows attributable to existing customers and the discount rate for the customer relationship intangible asset and the royalty rate forecasted revenue growth rates and the discount rate for the technology intangible asset although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates require judgment and are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from plex management 

the key assumption requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset was the customer attrition rate of 5 percent this rate was selected based on historical experience and information obtained from plex management a change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a change of 63 million in intangible assets the key assumptions requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the technology intangible asset were the royalty rate of 25 percent and the obsolescence factor the royalty rate was based on a detailed analysis considering the importance of the technology to the overall enterprise and market royalty data a change in the royalty rate of 500 basis points would result in a change of 47 million in intangible assets the obsolescence factor was calculated assuming phase out over ten years based on discussions with plex management the nature of the technology its integration into customers’ manufacturing systems and other thirdparty information for similar transactions a twoyear change in this assumption would result in a change of 52 million in intangible assets 

more information regarding this business combination is contained in note 4 in the consolidated financial statements 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2021 was 1570 million compared to 1309 million in 2020 approximately 88 percent of our 2021 global pension expense and 75 percent of our global projected benefit obligation relate to our us pension plan the discount rate used to determine our 2021 us pension expense was 290 percent compared to 330 percent for 2020 

for 2022 our us discount rate will increase to 310 percent from 290 percent in 2021 the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

the changes in our discount rate has an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the discount rate for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 14 in the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition — customer incentives 

we offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional hardware and software products solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits we record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within customer returns rebates and incentives in our consolidated balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of receivables customer incentives for additional hardware and software products solutions and services to be provided are considered distinct performance obligations as such we allocate revenue to them based on relative standalone selling price until the incentive is redeemed the revenue is recorded as a contract liability 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed our estimate is based primarily on historical experience if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 142 million 

more information regarding our revenue recognition and returns rebates and incentives policies are contained in note 1 and note 2 in the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions  sensia joint venture intangible assets valuation 

we recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the formation of sensia based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of october 1 2019 the accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the identifiable assets of the acquired entity any unallocated portion is recognized as goodwill we engaged an independent thirdparty valuation specialist to assist with the fair value allocation of the purchase price paid in connection with formation of the sensia joint venture to intangible assets which required the use of several assumptions and estimates although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from sensia management the key assumption requiring the use of judgment was the customer attrition rates ranging from 75 percent to 25 percent a change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a change of 404 million in intangible assets 

acquisitions  consolidation of sensia joint venture 

on october 1 2019 we completed the formation of a joint venture sensia a fully integrated digital oilfield automation solutions provider rockwell automation owns 53 percent of sensia and schlumberger owns 47 percent of sensia we control sensia and as of october 1 2019 have consolidated sensia in our financial results in determining whether to consolidate sensia us gaap requires that we evaluate our ability to control the significant financial and operating decisions of the joint venture determining the nature and extent of the noncontrolling interest holders rights involves management judgment we have evaluated the noncontrolling interest holders rights and determined that we control and should consolidate sensia in our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 141 million and a liability of 171 million at september 30 2021 we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies has an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to current levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 22 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2021 2020 or 2019 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt as of september 30 2021 includes 4840 million of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 018 percent and weighted average maturity period of 90 days there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2020 also included in shortterm debt as of september 30 2021 and 2020 are 235 million of interestbearing loans from schlumberger to sensia which were originally due september 30 2020 and are now due december 31 2021 we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our shortterm debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 34646 million at september 30 2021 and 19747 million at september 30 2020 the fair value of this debt was approximately 38748 million at september 30 2021 and 24977 million at september 30 2020 the potential increase in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

on august 31 2021 we acquired plex see note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information due to the timing of the acquisition and as permitted by the securities and exchange commission we have excluded internal controls at plex from our assessment of the internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2021 total assets and revenues of plex that were excluded from our assessment constitute 190 percent and 01 percent respectively of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended september 30 2021 we are in the process of integrating the acquired business into our existing operations and evaluating the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2021 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report that is included on the previous page

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management  integrated framework 2017 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry and economic risks 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations the duration and severity of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world natural disasters pandemics including the covid19 pandemic acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts power outages fires explosions equipment failures sabotage political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability disruptions to our it infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures and other events including disruptions at third party it and other service providers could also interfere with or disrupt our operations although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products solutions or services increase our costs or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products solutions or services 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy including in all of the regions in which we our suppliers distributors business partners and customers do business and in which our workforce is located the covid19 pandemic and efforts to manage it including those by governmental authorities have had and could continue to have significant impacts on global markets while the duration and severity of those impacts on our business are highly uncertain they have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in many ways including but not limited to the following 



 the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic make the duration and severity of its impacts increasingly difficult to predict which could limit our ability to respond to those impacts additionally the impacts described above and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic and responses to it could substantially increase the risk to us from the other risks described in this item 1a risk factors  

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced canceled or delayed orders payment delays or defaults supply chain disruptions or other adverse events as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns arise companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products solutions and services 

oil  gas is a major industry that we serve demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks including those related to commodity prices supply and demand dynamics productions costs geological and political activities when adverse oil  gas industry events arise companies may reduce their levels of spending which could result in decreased demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services 

our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

the london interbank offered rate libor is the basis for determining the amount of our interest payments on borrowings under our 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain agreements that use libor as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected additionally uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance or modification of libor alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially and adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks for additional information see financial condition in mda  

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation the domain expertise of our employees and partners product performance quality of our hardware and software products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems in addition we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure if we fail to achieve our objectives to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality hardware and software products solutions and services we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

business and operational risks 

we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 100 countries around the world approximately 46 percent of our sales in 2020 were to customers outside the us in addition our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to exports imports tariffs embargoes and other trade restrictions investments taxation product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates the occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more difficult to operate our business and may increase our costs which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products electronic components and commodities our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability of or delivery delays for singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales 

failures or security breaches of our products connected services manufacturing environment supply chain or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it in our hardware and software products solutions and services for customers manufacturing environment and in our enterprise infrastructure despite the implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors who may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information or sabotage our systems could be compromised by malware including ransomware cyber attacks and other events ranging from widespread nontargeted global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats given that our hardware and software products solutions and services are used in critical infrastructure these threats could indicate increased risk for our products services solutions manufacturing and it infrastructure past global cyber attacks have also been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widelyused software products increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products in some cases malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections 

our hardware and software products solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft tampering or sabotage careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property while we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products solutions and services we can reduce risk not eliminate it to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed installed protected configured updated and monitored and much of this is typically outside our control in addition the software supply chain introduces security vulnerabilities into many products across the industry 

our business uses it resources on a dispersed global basis for a wide variety of functions including development engineering manufacturing sales accounting and human resources our vendors partners employees and customers have access to and share information across multiple locations via various digital technologies in addition we rely on partners and vendors including cloud providers for a wide range of outsourced activities as part of our internal it infrastructure and our commercial offerings secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations also our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers employees and others we design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners’ infrastructure for example a cloud platform could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business 

the current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies including those in industrial automation and information like other global companies we have experienced cyber threats and incidents although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition our information security efforts under the leadership of our chief information security officer and chief product security officer with the support of the entire management team include major programs designed to address security governance and risk product security identification and protection of critical assets insider risk thirdparty risk security awareness and cyber defense operations we believe these measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends demand for our products could decline 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales 

in north america a large percentage of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors we depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products solutions and services and deliver value to our customers disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products solutions and services could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

our business success depends on attracting developing and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees and the effective implementation of processes and technology to increase employee engagement productivity and efficiency the skills experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance difficulty attracting developing and retaining members of our management team and key employees with the necessary expertise including by offering attractive compensation benefits and development opportunities could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition we continuously evaluate modify and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement productivity and efficiency and to mitigate failure risks from older technologies currently in use failure to identify and successfully implement new processes and technologies could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and negatively impact employee engagement productivity and efficiency 

increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations which could change as well as healthcare cost inflation an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

strategic transactions and investments risks 

failure to identify manage complete and integrate strategic transactions may adversely affect our business or we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions 

as part of our strategy we may pursue strategic transactions including acquisitions joint ventures investments other business opportunities and purchases of technology from third parties in order to be successful we must identify attractive transaction opportunities effectively complete the transaction and manage postclosing matters such as integration of the acquired business or technology including related personnel and cooperation with our joint venture and other strategic partners we may not be able to identify or complete beneficial transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions and we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions including 

 

future strategic transactions and technology investments could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and impairment and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 

we own common stock in ptc inc and are exposed to the volatility liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock 

we own common stock of ptc inc ptc a nasdaqlisted company that we acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10 billion we present this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period the fair value of our shares of ptc common stock ptc shares is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market changes in general economic conditions and the performance of ptc we recognize all changes in the fair value of the ptc shares whether realized or unrealized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations accordingly changes in the fair value of the ptc shares can materially impact the earnings we report which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations in particular significant declines in the fair value of the ptc shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings 

while there is an established trading market for shares of ptc common stock there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the ptc shares should we wish to reduce our investment until july 19 2021 we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the ptc shares subject to certain exceptions in addition we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the ptc shares under the securities laws further the reported value of the ptc shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price if we were forced to sell some or all of the ptc shares in the market there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the ptc shares that we have reported on our consolidated balance sheet and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 

finally our equity position in ptc is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over ptc 

legal tax and regulatory risks 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action including those related to corporate income taxes may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in those countries and other jurisdictions or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification and labeling laws and regulations our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services compliance with state federal and foreign privacy regulations such as the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits 

our operations are subject to various environmental regulations concerning human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and water the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so

we help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency environmental and safety goals customers across all industries are investing in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor control and energyefficient solutions and services in addition environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices 

acquisitions and investments 

our acquisition and investment strategy focuses on hardware and software products solutions and services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings 

in april 2020 we acquired asem spa asem a leading provider of digital automation technologies asem’s products will allow us to provide customers with a high degree of configurability for their industrial computing needs allow them to achieve faster time to market lower their cost of ownership improve asset utilization and better manage enterprise risk 

in april 2020 we also acquired kalypso lp kalypso a privatelyheld usbased software delivery and consulting firm specializing in the digital transformation of industrial companies with a strong client base in life sciences consumer products and industrial hightech this acquisition enhances our ability to implement and deploy technology and deliver even greater value to our customers 

in january 2020 we acquired avnet data security ltd avnet an israelbased cybersecurity provider with over 20 years of experience providing cybersecurity services avnet’s combination of service delivery training research and managed services will enable us to service a much larger set of customers globally while also continuing to accelerate our portfolio development in this market 

on october 1 2019 we completed the formation of a joint venture sensia a fully integrated digital oilfield automation solutions provider the joint venture leverages schlumberger’s oil and gas domain knowledge and our automation and information expertise rockwell automation owns 53 of sensia and schlumberger owns 47 of sensia

in 2018 we made several investments including in shares of ptc common stock the “ptc shares” ptc is the leader in the industrial internet of things and augmented reality our investment in and alliance with ptc is accelerating growth for both companies and enabling us to be the partner of choice for customers around the world who want to transform their physical operations with digital technology in order to achieve increased productivity heightened plant efficiency reduced operational risk and better system interoperability 

we believe these acquisitions and investments will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers 

attracting developing and retaining highly qualified talent 

successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team the skills experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance we continuously evaluate modify and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement productivity and efficiency 

at september 30 2020 our employees including those employed by consolidated subsidiaries by region were approximately 



at september 30 2020 we had the following global gender demographics 



at september 30 2020 our us employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics 



there are several ways in which we attract develop and retain highly qualified talent including 

 continuous improvement 

productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2020  sales in the us accounted for over half of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2018 to 2020  these figures are as of november 10 2020 and are subject to revision by the issuing organizations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 pmi and the ip index improved compared to the prior quarter however industrial output in the us at the end of the fourth quarter was still below its prepandemic level sequential growth is projected for the ip index in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus economic trends 

in 2020  sales to customers outside the us accounted for less than half of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with a global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “overview” section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in key countries gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

after a significant decline in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 industrial output outside the us saw sequential growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 similar to the us industrial output remains below prepandemic levels in most regions however sequential growth is projected for all regions in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

covid19 pandemic 

we are actively monitoring the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies while the duration and severity of those impacts are highly uncertain they have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our company is an essential business to support critical infrastructure because our customers cannot build their products at scale without automation 

we have a global supply chain including a network of suppliers and distribution and manufacturing facilities our supply chain team is closely managing our endtoend supply chain from sourcing to production to customer delivery and with a particular focus on all critical and atrisk suppliers and supplier locations globally 

we have implemented safety and hygiene processes at our manufacturing and distribution locations to keep our employees safe including separation of shifts and workstations temperature monitoring and other recommended practices we have also taken actions to help keep our nonmanufacturing employees safe including directing employees to work from home wherever possible limiting and screening visitors to our facilities implementing travel restrictions canceling events that involve large groups of people encouraging social distancing best practices and enhancing cleaning in our facilities and major locations some of the changes implemented have resulted in and could continue to result in operational inefficiencies 

our solutions and services businesses include engineers and other employees who design and implement solutions through a combination of domain expertise and our technology physical access to customer facilities is often important as we deliver those solutions as a result of covid19 access to customer facilities in some instances has been difficult this has led to some project delays as well as inefficiencies due to lower labor utilization 

on april 8 2020 we announced several actions to address the thencurrent and anticipated economic conditions as a result of the global covid19 pandemic and we have taken additional cost actions there was no payout earned under our incentive plans for fiscal 2020 and we have adjusted our cost structure to help balance our financial strength and flexibility with protecting our most important investments to drive longterm differentiation these actions included elimination of all discretionary spending delays of noncritical investments further adjustment of levels of contract labor and deferral of any nonessential capital expenditures we implemented the following temporary cost actions effective may 2020 through november 2020 salary reductions for all nonmanufacturing employees globally and temporary suspension of the 401k match for all us employees we also reduced cash fees for the board of directors effective through december 2020 

while we have taken several cost reduction actions we have maintained and in some cases have selectively increased investments in some of our highest priority areas in order to increase differentiation and create longterm value for customers and shareowners 

oil  gas industry 

th e covid19 pandemic had a cascading effect on the oil  gas industry business closures and restrictions on people’s mobility decreased demand for oil and gas during the year global production levels exceeded lower demand which resulted in global oversupply and volatility in oil prices these factors have had and could continue to have a negative impact on our oil  gas customers’ business operations and financial condition resulting in reductions in their industrial spending 

outlook 

beginning in fiscal 2021 we are changing our definition of adjusted income and adjusted eps to exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense attributable to rockwell automation including the related tax effects the definition of adjusted effective tax rate is also changing to correspond to the purchase accounting items now being excluded from adjusted income we believe these new definitions provide more useful information about our operating performance and allow management and investors to better compare our operating performance period over period compared to our prior definitions of these measures given our increased inorganic investments see adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation for more information on these nongaap measures adjusted eps guidance in the table below is presented using the new definition 

the covid19 pandemic and global efforts to respond to it continue to evolve our projections assume that a gradual recovery continues with no increase in pandemicrelated facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain based on the information available to us at the time of this release the following table provides guidance as it relates to sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2021

general corporate  net expenses were 989 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 1088 million in fiscal 2019  

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes increased 26 percent from 9010 million in 2019 to 11361 million in 2020  primarily due to fairvalue adjustments recognized in 2019 and 2020 in connection with our investment in ptc the “ptc adjustments” partially offset by lower sales total segment operating earnings decreased 15 percent year over year from 14736 million in 2019 to 12579 million in 2020  primarily due to lower sales partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2020 was 99 percent compared to 228 percent in 2019  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the ptc adjustments tax benefits recognizable upon the formation of the sensia joint venture and other discrete items the adjusted effective tax rate in 2020 was 120 percent compared to 179 percent in 2019  the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to our benefit from nonus tax rates tax benefits recognizable upon the formation of the sensia joint venture and other discrete items

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes decreased 32 percent from 13308 million in 2018 to 9010 million in 2019  primarily due to gains and losses on investments and valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares total segment operating earnings increased 2 percent year over year from 14418 million in 2018 to 14736 million in 2019  

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2019 was 228 percent compared to 598 percent in 2018  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior year impact of tax expense related to the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 3958 million or 298 percent withholding taxes on previously taxed foreign earnings 381 million or 28 percent the revaluation of net deferred tax assets resulting from the tax act 1044 million or 79 percent and the impact of the lower us statutory tax rate under the tax act 

the adjusted effective tax rate in 2019 was 179 percent compared to 193 percent in 2018  the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower us statutory tax rate under the tax act

supplemental segment information 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost credit are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment’s operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost credit net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests gains and losses on investments valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares in fiscal 2019 and 2018 and costs related to the unsolicited emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 including their respective tax effects and the adjustments related to the tax act in fiscal 2018 nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost credit is defined as all components of our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost except for service cost see note 14 in the consolidated financial statements for more information on our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost 

we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for net income attributable to rockwell automation diluted eps and effective tax rate 

the following are reconciliations of net income attributable to rockwell automation diluted eps and effective tax rate to adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate respectively in millions except per share amounts and percentages 



1 includes gain loss on investments and valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares 

beginning in fiscal 2021 we are changing our definition of adjusted income and adjusted eps to also exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense attributable to rockwell automation and the related tax effects of such exclusion the definition of adjusted effective tax rate is also changing to correspond to the purchase accounting items now being excluded from adjusted income 

under this new definition adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense attributable to rockwell automation nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost credit gains and losses on investments valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares in fiscal 2019 and 2018 and costs related to the unsolicited emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 including their respective tax effects and the adjustments related to the tax act in fiscal 2018 

adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate guidance and comparable prior periods in the table below are presented using the new definitions and these nongaap measures are reconciled to the corresponding gaap measures 



1 the year ended september 30 2020 included a gain on investment of 1539 million due to the change in value of our investment in ptc fiscal 2021 guidance excludes estimates of these adjustments on a forwardlooking basis due to variability complexity and limited visibility of these items

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure in millions 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses’ operations and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations if any operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations if any are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 11205 million for the year ended september 30 2020  compared to 11820 million for the year ended september 30 2019  free cash flow was 10066 million for the year ended september 30 2020  compared to 10492 million for the year ended september 30 2019  the yearoveryear decreases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to lower pretax income excluding noncash adjustments and a voluntary 500 million contribution to our us qualified pension plan in fiscal 2020 partially offset by lower income tax and incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

we repurchased approximately 14 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2020 at a total cost of 2547 million and an average cost of 18218 per share in 2019  we repurchased approximately 61 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of 10 billion and an average cost of 16468 per share at september 30 2020  there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2019  there were 93 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2020  our decision to repurchase shares in 2021 will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price on both september 6 2018 and july 24 2019 the board of directors authorized us to expend 10 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock at september 30 2020  we had approximately 8537 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses and other inorganic investments dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2021 to be about 150 million  we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

at september 30 2020  the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held by nonus subsidiaries as a result of the broad changes to the us international tax system under the tax act in fiscal year 2018 we began to account for substantially all of our nonus subsidiaries as being immediately subject to tax while still concluding that earnings are indefinitely reinvested for a limited number of subsidiaries 

during fiscal 2020  we repatriated approximately 5136 million to the us from our foreign subsidiaries the source of these funds was cash and cash equivalents and from the liquidation of short and longterm investments 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 

our shortterm debt as of september 30 2020  primarily consisted of 235 million of interestbearing loans from schlumberger to sensia which were originally due september 30 2020 and are now due september 30 2021 the shortterm loans from schlumberger were entered into following formation of sensia see note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on sensia there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2020 and 2019  

in april 2020 we entered into a 4000 million senior unsecured 364day term loan credit agreement and were advanced the full loan amount this agreement was in addition to our existing 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in november 2023 which remains available and undrawn interest on these borrowings was based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings were outstanding we repaid the 4000 million term loan in september 2020 

in march 2019 we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm notes in a registered public offering the offering consisted of 4250 million of 3500 notes due in march 2029 “2029 notes” and 5750 million of 4200 notes due in march 2049 “2049 notes” both issued at a discount net proceeds to the company from the debt offering were 9876 million we used these net proceeds primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes 

on november 13 2018 we replaced our former fiveyear 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new fiveyear 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in november 2023 we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 7500 million subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the former credit facility we did not borrow against either facility during the periods ended september 30 2020 or 2019  borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding this credit facility contains covenants under which we agree to maintain an ebitdatointerest ratio of at least 30 to 10 the ebitdatointerest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period 

libor is the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under our 125 billion credit facility banks currently reporting information used to set libor will stop doing so after 2021 various parties including government agencies are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace libor we are monitoring their efforts and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided 

separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 2296 million at september 30 2020  were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2020 and 2019  were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2020 and 2019  there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under our credit facilities 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2020  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions conditions in the commercial paper market have improved since the covid19 pandemic negatively affected this market in march and april 2020 although we have had no commercial paper outstanding since midapril 2020 we do not believe we would have difficulty issuing commercial paper if the need arose currently if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities’ functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 4728 million in 2020  408 per common share 4598 million in 2019  388 per common share and 4408 million in 2018  351 per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2020 is 102 per common share  408 per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2020 is as follows in millions 





 

 

 

 

 



supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we divest a business we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year excluding divestitures we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales in millions 



1 includes incremental sales resulting from the formation of the sensia joint venture and sales from other acquired businesses in fiscal year 2020

critical accounting estimates 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported these estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions but actual results could differ from those estimates refer to note 1 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2020 was 1309 million compared to 720 million in 2019  approximately 83 percent of our 2020 global pension expense and 76 percent of our global projected benefit obligation relate to our us pension plan the discount rate used to determine our 2020 us pension expense was 330 percent  compared to 435 percent for 2019  

for 2021  our us discount rate will decrease to 290 percent from 330 percent in 2020  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

the changes in our discount rate has an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the discount rate for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 14 in the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition — customer incentives 

we offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional hardware and software products solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits we record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within customer returns rebates and incentives in our consolidated balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of receivables customer incentives for additional hardware and software products solutions and services to be provided are considered distinct performance obligations as such we allocate revenue to them based on relative standalone selling price until the incentive is redeemed the revenue is recorded as a contract liability 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed our estimate is based primarily on historical experience if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 118 million  

more information regarding our revenue recognition and returns rebates and incentives policies are contained in note 1 and note 2 in the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions  consolidation of sensia joint venture 

in determining whether to consolidate sensia us gaap requires that we evaluate our ability to control the significant financial and operating decisions of the joint venture determining the nature and extent of the noncontrolling interest holders rights involves management judgment we have evaluated the noncontrolling interest holders rights and determined that we control and should consolidate sensia in our financial results 

acquisitions  sensia joint venture intangibles valuation 

the accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the identifiable assets of the acquired entity any unallocated portion is recognized as goodwill we engaged an independent thirdparty valuation specialist for the fair value allocation of the purchase price paid in connection with formation of the sensia joint venture to intangible assets which required the use of several assumptions and estimates although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from sensia management the key assumption requiring the use of judgment was the customer attrition rates ranging from 75 to 25  a change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a change of 404 million in intangible assets 

more information regarding this business combination is contained in note 4 in the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  sensia reporting unit 

the quantitative test of goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units during the second quarter of 2020 we performed a quantitative impairment test for our sensia reporting unit we determined the fair value of the reporting unit under a combination of an income approach derived from discounted cash flows and a market multiples approach using selected comparable public companies 

critical assumptions used in this approach included management’s estimated future revenue growth rates estimated future margins and discount rate estimated future revenue growth and margins are based on management’s best estimate about current and future conditions although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates are based on a number of factors including historical experience and information obtained from reporting unit management actual results could differ from these estimates especially given the uncertainty over the duration and severity of impacts related to the covid19 pandemic and the impact on our oil  gas customers which have been and could continue to be impacted by the recent volatility in oil prices we determined the discount rate using our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors specific to the reporting unit with comparison to market and industry data a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the fair value of this reporting unit would not impact our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired 

more information regarding goodwill is contained in note 3 in the consolidated financial statements

see note 1 in the consolidated financial statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 140 million and a liability of 275 million at september 30 2020  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2020 and 2019  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to 2020 levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 101 million  

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2020  2019 or 2018 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt as of september 30 2020  primarily consisted of 235 million of interestbearing loans from schlumberger to sensia due september 30 2021 the potential increase in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2020 and 2019 we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm and current portion of longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 19747 million at september 30 2020 and 22569 million at september 30 2019  the fair value of this debt was approximately 24977 million at september 30 2020 and 26809 million at september 30 2019  the potential increase in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management  integrated framework 2017 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced canceled or delayed orders payment delays or defaults supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our hardware and software products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns arise companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

the london interbank offered rate libor is the basis for determining the amount of our interest payments on borrowings under our 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in addition we have outstanding interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain agreements that use libor as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected additionally uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance or modification of libor alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks for additional information see financial condition in mda  

we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 100 countries around the world approximately 46 percent of our sales in 2019 were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to exports imports tariffs embargoes and other trade restrictions investments taxation product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates the occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more 

difficult to operate our business and increase our costs which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products electronic components and commodities our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability of or delivery delays for singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales 

failures or security breaches of our products connected services manufacturing environment supply chain or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it in our hardware and software products solutions and services for customers manufacturing environment and in our enterprise infrastructure despite the implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors who may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information or sabotage our systems could be compromised by malware including ransomware cyber attacks and other events ranging from widespread nontargeted global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats given that our hardware and software products and services are used in critical infrastructure these threats could indicate increased risk for our products services manufacturing and it infrastructure recent global cyber attacks have been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widelyused software products increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products in some cases malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections 

our hardware and software products solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft tampering or sabotage careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property while we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products solutions and services we can reduce risk not eliminate it to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed installed protected configured updated and monitored much of which are typically outside our control 

our business uses it resources on a dispersed global basis for a wide variety of functions including development engineering manufacturing sales accounting and human resources our vendors partners employees and customers have access to and share information across multiple locations via various digital technologies in addition we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities including cloud providers as part of our internal it infrastructure and our commercial offerings secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations also our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers employees and others we design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners’ infrastructure for example a cloud platform could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business 

the current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies including those in industrial automation and information like other global companies we have experienced cyber threats and incidents although none have been material or 

had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition our information security efforts under the leadership of our chief information security officer and chief product security officer with the support of the entire management team include major programs designed to address security governance product security identification and protection of critical assets insider risk thirdparty risk and cyber defense operations we believe these measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of an information security incident any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends demand for our products could decline 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect our results of operations 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification and labeling laws and regulations our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services compliance with state federal and foreign privacy regulations such as the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation the domain expertise of our employees and partners product performance quality of our hardware and software products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems in addition we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure if we fail to achieve our objectives to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality hardware and software products solutions and services we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales 

in north america a large percentage of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors we depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products and services and deliver value to our customers disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products and services could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

failure to identify manage complete and integrate strategic transactions may adversely affect our business or we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions 

as part of our strategy we may pursue strategic transactions including acquisitions joint ventures investments other business opportunities and purchases of technology from third parties in order to be successful we must identify attractive transaction opportunities effectively complete the transaction and manage postclosing matters such as integration of the acquired business or technology including related personnel and cooperation with our joint venture and other strategic partners we may not be able to identify or complete beneficial transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions and we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions including 

 

future strategic transactions and technology investments could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and impairment and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters pandemics acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world natural disasters pandemics acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts power outages fires explosions equipment failures sabotage political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability disruptions to our it infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures and other events including disruptions at third party it and other service providers could also interfere with or disrupt our operations although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products solutions or services increase our costs or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products solutions or services 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business success depends on attracting developing and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees and the effective implementation of processes and technology to increase employee engagement productivity and efficiency the skills experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance difficulty attracting developing and retaining members of our management team and key employees with the necessary expertise including by offering attractive compensation benefits and development opportunities could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition we continuously evaluate modify and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement productivity and efficiency and to mitigate failure risks from older technologies currently in use failure to identify and successfully implement new processes and technologies could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and negatively impact employee engagement productivity and efficiency 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits 

our operations are subject to various environmental regulations concerning human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and water the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

we own common stock in ptc inc and are exposed to the volatility liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock 

we own common stock of ptc inc ptc a nasdaqlisted company that we acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10 billion we present this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period less a valuation adjustment for periods ending prior to the registration of our shares of ptc common stock shares under the securities act of 1933 as amended on november 28 2018 per a registration rights agreement entered into with ptc the fair value of the shares is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market changes in general economic conditions and the performance of ptc we will recognize all changes in the fair value of the shares whether realized or unrealized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations accordingly changes in the fair value of the shares can materially impact the earnings we report which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations in particular significant declines in the fair value of the shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings 

while there is an established trading market for shares of ptc common stock there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the shares should we wish to reduce our investment until july 19 2021 we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the shares subject to certain exceptions in addition we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the shares under the securities laws further the reported value of the shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price if we were forced to sell some or all of the shares in the market there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the shares that we have reported on our consolidated balance sheet and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 

finally our equity position in ptc is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over ptc 

increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations which could change as well as healthcare cost inflation an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition

in november 2017 we acquired odos imaging limited a scottish technology company that provides threedimensional timeofflight sensing systems for industrial imaging applications this acquisition enables us to expand our existing capabilities by bringing 3d timeofflight sensor technology to industrial applications 

we believe these acquisitions and investments will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers 

continuous improvement 

productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2019  sales in the us accounted for approximately 54 percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2017 to 2019  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 the ip index improved slightly compared to the prior quarter and the same quarter in the prior year pmi is now below 50 and decreased compared to the prior quarter and the same quarter in the prior year 



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus economic trends 

in 2019  sales outside the us accounted for approximately 46 percent of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “overview” section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in the respective countries’ gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

macroeconomic indicators have slowed during 2019 and are projected to slow further in 2020 particularly in ip and gross domestic product growth rates the economic outlook for europe and china has softened further amid slowing global growth trade tension with the us and continued brexit uncertainty overall latin america ip is expected to increase 

summary of results of operations 

in 2019  sales were 66948 million  an increase of 04 percent year over year organic sales increased 28 percent  currency translation decreased sales by 24 percentage points  organic sales growth was broadbased across regions and was led by strength in process end markets 

the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives 



the following table reflects our sales and operating results in millions except per share amounts 





 purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit credit cost are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment’s operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit credit cost costs related to the unsolicited emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 gains and losses on investments and valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares including their respective tax effects and the adjustments related to the tax act in fiscal 2018 

we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations diluted eps and effective tax rate 

we have adopted asu 201707 which defines operating and nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost under this new standard only the service cost component of pension and postretirement benefit cost is an operating cost all other components of pension and postretirement benefit cost are considered to be nonoperating costs these components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are the result of market performance we consider these and other excluded costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business 

the following are the components of operating and nonoperating pension and postretirement benefit cost in millions

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted the tax act significantly changed us tax law by among other things lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from us tax “transition tax” as a fiscal year taxpayer certain provisions of the tax act impacted us in fiscal year 2018 including the change in the federal statutory rate and the transition tax while other provisions were effective in fiscal year 2019 including the tax on global intangible lowtax income “gilti” of foreign subsidiaries the deduction of foreign derived intangible income “fdii” and the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction 

the effective tax rate in 2018 was 598 percent compared to 204 percent in 2017  the increase in the effective tax rate was due to provisional expense related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 3958 million or 298 percent withholding taxes on previously taxed foreign earnings 381 million or 28 percent and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets 1044 million or 79 percent 

the adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 was 193 percent compared to 215 percent in 2017  the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower us statutory tax rate under the tax act partially offset by lower discrete tax items in 2018

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure in millions 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses’ operations and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations if any operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations if any are presented separately in our statement of cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 11820 million for the year ended september 30 2019  compared to 13000 million for the year ended september 30 2018  free cash flow was 10492 million for the year ended september 30 2019  compared to 11745 million for the year ended september 30 2018  the yearoveryear decreases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to an increase in working capital a payment due to settlement of treasury locks and higher tax payments including a payment for taxes under the tax act related to deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 

we repurchased approximately 61 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2019 at a total cost of 10 billion  in 2018  we repurchased approximately 83 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of 15 billion  at september 30 2019  there were 93 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2020  at september 30 2018  there were 183 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2019  our decision to repurchase shares in 2020 will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price on both september 6 2018 and july 24 2019 the board of directors authorized us to expend an additional 10 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock at september 30 2019  we had approximately 11084 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses and other inorganic investments dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be about 160 million  we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

at september 30 2019  approximately half of our cash and cash equivalents were held by nonus subsidiaries as a result of the broad changes to the us international tax system under the tax act in fiscal year 2018 the company began to account for substantially all of its nonus subsidiaries as being immediately subject to tax while still concluding that earnings are indefinitely reinvested for a limited number of subsidiaries 

during fiscal 2019  we repatriated approximately 7673 million to the us from our foreign subsidiaries the source of these funds was cash and cash equivalents and from the liquidation of short and longterm investments 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 

in march 2019 we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm notes in a registered public offering the offering consisted of 4250 million of 3500 notes due in march 2029 “2029 notes” and 5750 million of 4200 notes due in march 2049 “2049 notes” both issued at a discount net proceeds to the company from the debt offering were 9876 million we used these net proceeds primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes 

our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2019  commercial paper borrowings were 5500 million at september 30 2018  the weighted average interest rate of the commercial paper outstanding was 227 percent at september 30 2018  

on november 13 2018 we replaced our former fiveyear 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new fiveyear 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in november 2023 we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 7500 million subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the former credit facility we did not borrow against either facility during the periods ended september 30 2019 or 2018  borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding this credit facility contains covenants under which we agree to maintain an ebitdatointerest ratio of at least 30 to 10 the ebitdatointerest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period 

libor is the basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under our 125 billion credit facility in addition we have outstanding interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor banks currently reporting information used to set libor will stop doing so after 2021 various parties including government agencies are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace libor we are monitoring their efforts and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided 

separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 2171 million at september 30 2019 were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2019 and 2018 were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2019 and 2018  there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under our credit facilities 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2019  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities in february 2017 we began investing in investmentgrade fixed income securities including corporate debt and government obligations to provide further diversification refer to note 9 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these investments our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities’ functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 4598 million in 2019  388 per common share 4408 million in 2018  351 per common share and 3907 million in 2017  304 per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2019 is 097 per common share  388 per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2019 is as follows in millions 



 

 

 

 

 

 



supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period when we divest a business we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year excluding divestitures we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales in millions 





the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales in millions 





critical accounting estimates 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported these estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions but actual results could differ from those estimates refer to note 1 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2019 was 720 million compared to 1141 million in 2018  approximately 76 percent of our 2019 global pension expense and global projected benefit obligation relates to our us pension plan the discount rate used to determine our 2019 us pension expense was 435 percent  compared to 390 percent for 2018  

for 2020  our us discount rate will decrease to 330 percent from 435 percent in 2019  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

the changes in our discount rate has an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the discount rate for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 13 in the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition — customer incentives 

we offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional hardware and software products solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits customer incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional hardware and software products solutions and services to be provided we record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within customer returns rebates and incentives in our consolidated balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of receivables 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed our estimate is based primarily on historical experience if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 120 million  

more information regarding our revenue recognition and returns rebates and incentives policies are contained in note 1 in the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 281 million and a liability of 56 million at september 30 2019  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2019  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations in 2018  the relative weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to 2019 levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 23 million  

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2019  2018 or 2017 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2019  commercial paper borrowings were 5500 million at september 30 2018  with a weighted average interest rate of 227 percent and weighted average maturity period of 26 days we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm and current portion of longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 22569 million at september 30 2019 and 12252 million at september 30 2018  the fair value of this debt was approximately 26809 million at september 30 2019 and 13913 million at september 30 2018  the potential increase in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity 

in february 2015 we entered into interest rate swap contracts which we designated as fair value hedges these interest rate swaps effectively converted the 6000 million aggregate principal amount of our 2050 percent notes payable in march 2020 “2020 notes” and 2875 percent notes payable in march 2025 “2025 notes” to floating rate debt each at a rate based on threemonth libor plus a fixed spread the effective floating interest rates were 2576 percent for the 2020 notes and 2986 percent for the 2025 notes at september 30 2019  the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at september 30 2019 was a net unrealized gain of 70 million  a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our interest rate swaps would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

 adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced canceled or delayed orders payment delays or defaults supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our hardware and software products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns arise companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 80  countries around the world approximately 45 percent  of our sales in 2018  were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to exports imports tariffs embargoes and other trade restrictions investments taxation product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates the occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more difficult to operate our business and increase our costs which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends demand for our products could decline 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products electronic components and commodities our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability of or delivery delays for singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales 

failures or security breaches of our products connected services manufacturing environment supply chain or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it in our hardware and software products solutions and services for customers manufacturing environment and in our enterprise it infrastructure despite the implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors who may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information or sabotage these systems could be compromised by malware including ransomware cyber attacks and other events ranging from widespread nontargeted global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats given that our hardware and software products and services are used in critical infrastructure these threats could indicate increased risk for our products services manufacturing and it infrastructure recent global cyber attacks have been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widelyused software products increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products in some cases malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections 

our hardware and software products solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft tampering or sabotage careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property while we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products solutions and services we can reduce risk not eliminate it to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed installed protected configured updated and monitored much of which are typically outside our control 

our business uses it resources on a dispersed global basis for a wide variety of functions including development engineering manufacturing sales accounting and human resources our vendors partners employees and customers have access to and share information across multiple locations via various digital technologies in addition we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities including cloud providers are part of our internal it infrastructure and our commercial offerings secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations also our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers employees and others we design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners’ infrastructure for example a cloud platform could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business 

the current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies including those in industrial automation and information like other global companies we have experienced cyber threats and incidents although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition our information security efforts under the leadership of our chief information security officer and chief product security officer with the support of the entire management team include major programs designed to address security governance product security identification and protection of critical assets insider risk thirdparty risk and cyber defense operations we believe these measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of an information 

security incident any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect   our results of operations 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification and labeling laws and regulations our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products solutions and services compliance with increasing privacy regulation such as the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation the domain expertise of our employees and partners product performance quality of our hardware and software products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems in addition we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure if we fail to achieve our objectives to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality hardware and software products solutions and services we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales 

in the united states and canada a large percentage of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors we depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products and services and deliver value to our customers disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products and services could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters pandemics acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world natural disasters pandemics acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts power outages fires explosions equipment failures sabotage political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability disruptions to our it infrastructure from system failures shutdowns power outages telecommunication or utility failures and other events including disruptions at third party it and other service providers could also interfere with or disrupt our operations although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products solutions or services increase our costs or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products solutions or services 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business success depends on attracting developing and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance difficulty attracting developing and retaining members of our management team and key employees including employees with the necessary technological expertise could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to various environmental regulations that are concerned with human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and water the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

failure to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions and technology investments may adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy we may pursue acquisitions of or investment opportunities in businesses as well as the purchase of technology from third parties in order to be successful with these transactions we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transaction and manage postclosing matters such as integration of the acquired business or technology we may not be able to identify or complete beneficial acquisition or transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions including 

 future acquisitions and technology investments could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and impairment and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 

  we own common stock in ptc inc and are exposed to the volatility liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock 

we own common stock of ptc inc ptc a nasdaqlisted company that we acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10 billion we present this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period less a valuation adjustment pending registration of our shares of ptc common stock shares under the securities act of 1933 as amended which per a registration rights agreement entered into with ptc must occur no later than july 19 2019 the fair value of the shares is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market changes in general economic conditions and the performance of ptc we will recognize all changes in the fair value of the shares whether realized or unrealized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations accordingly changes in the fair value of the shares can materially impact the earnings we report which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations in particular significant declines in the fair value of the shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings 

while there is an established trading market for shares of ptc common stock there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the shares should we wish to reduce our investment until approximately july 19 2021 we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the shares subject to certain exceptions in addition we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the shares under the securities laws further the reported value of our shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price if we were forced to sell some or all the shares in the market there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the shares that we have reported on our consolidated balance sheet and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 

finally our equity position in ptc is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over ptc 

increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations which could change as well as healthcare cost inflation an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2018  sales in the us accounted for approximately 55  percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2016  to 2018  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 all indicators except pmi improved compared to the prior quarter and the same quarter in the prior year pmi decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter and the same quarter in the prior year but continues to be significantly above 50 



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus economic trends 

in 2018  sales outside the us accounted for approximately 45 percent  of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “overview” section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in the respective countries gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

macroeconomic indicators remain favorable in most geographies although ip and gross domestic product growth rates are projected to slow in 2019 in china the impact of trade tensions is expected to be partially offset by government stimulus and solid domestic and foreign demand in india is expected to help support continued manufacturing growth in europe the economy is affected by slowing export growth driven by a strong euro against emerging market currencies and increasing oil prices latin america is expected to continue to benefit from a strong us economy growth rates in canada are expected to be lower in 2019 

summary of results of operations 

in 2018  sales were 66660 million  an increase of 56 percent  year over year organic sales increased 55 percent  currency translation increased sales by 14 percentage points  and the prior year divestiture reduced sales growth by 13 percentage points  growth was broadbased across industries led by food and beverage mining life sciences and semiconductor 

the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives 



the following table reflects our sales and operating results in millions except per share amounts 





purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segments operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



the decreases in nonoperating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2018 were primarily due to a 200 million voluntary contribution in fiscal 2017 and other actuarial adjustments the increases in nonoperating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the decrease in our us discount rate from 455 percent for fiscal 2016 to 375 percent for fiscal 2017 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension costs costs related to the unsolicited emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 gains and losses on investments and valuation adjustments pending registration of ptc shares including their respective tax effects and the provisional effects of the tax act 

we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations diluted eps and effective tax rate 

nonoperating pension costs include defined benefit plan interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements these components of net periodic pension cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance we consider these and other excluded costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business 

  

the following are the components of operating and nonoperating pension costs in millions 

the following are reconciliations of income from continuing operations diluted eps from continuing operations and effective tax rate to adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate respectively in millions except per share amounts and percentages

income before income taxes increased   28 percent  from 10374 million  in 2017  to 13308 million  in 2018  primarily due to ptc adjustments higher sales and lower restructuring charges partially offset by the absence of the gain on the 2017 divestiture total segment operating earnings increased   17 percent  year over year from 12331 million  in 2017  to 14426 million  in 2018  primarily due to higher sales 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted the tax act significantly changes us tax law by among other things lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from us tax transition tax as a fiscal year taxpayer certain provisions of the tax act impact us in fiscal year 2018 including the change in the federal statutory rate and the transition tax while other provisions will be effective in fiscal year 2019 including the tax on global intangible lowtax income gilti of foreign subsidiaries the deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii and the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction 

the effective tax rate in 2018  was 598 percent  compared to 204 percent  in 2017  the increase in the effective tax rate was due to provisional expense related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 3958 million or 298 percent withholding taxes on previously taxed foreign earnings 381 million or 28 percent and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets 1044 million or 79 percent 

the adjusted effective tax rate in 2018  was 193 percent  compared to 215 percent  in 2017  the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower us statutory tax rate under the tax act partially offset by lower discrete tax items in the current year

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure in millions 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses operations and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations if any operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations if any are presented separately in our statement of cash flows in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we adopted a new sharebased compensation accounting standard that requires the excess income tax benefit from sharebased compensation to be classified as an operating rather than as a financing cash flow in previous periods we added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 no adjustment is necessary as this benefit is already included in operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 13000 million  for the year ended september 30 2018  compared to 10340 million  for the year ended september 30 2017  free cash flow was 11745 million  for the year ended september 30 2018  compared to 8923 million  for the year ended september 30 2017  the yearoveryear increases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to a voluntary contribution of 2000 million to our us qualified pension plan in 2017 

we repurchased approximately 83 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2018  at a total cost of 15 billion  in 2017  we repurchased approximately 23 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of 3366 million  at september 30 2018  there were 183 million  of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2019  at september 30 2017  there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2018  our decision to repurchase shares in 2019  will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price on both january 15 2018 and september 6 2018 the board of directors authorized us to expend an additional 10 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock at september 30 2018  we had approximately 11084 million  remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

during fiscal 2018 we repatriated approximately 23 billion to the us from our foreign subsidiaries the repatriated funds were primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock and fund the investment in ptc the source of these funds was cash and cash equivalents and from the liquidation of short and longterm investments 

at september 30 2018 substantially all of our cash cash equivalents and investments funds were held by nonus subsidiaries due to the enactment of the tax act in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 our previously undistributed foreign earnings were subject to a transition tax of approximately 3894 million accordingly these funds will not be subject to further us tax if repatriated refer to note 14 in the financial statements for further information regarding the effect of the enactment of the tax act on our financial condition and results of operations 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2019  to be about 150 million  we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 5500 million  at september 30 2018  with a weighted average interest rate of 227 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 26  days commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 3500 million  at september 30 2017  with a weighted average interest rate of 126 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 10  days 

at september 30 2018  and 2017  our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2020 was 10 billion  we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 3500 million  subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended september 30 2018  or 2017  in december 2016 we amended the financial covenant under this credit facility the previous financial covenant which limited our debttototalcapital ratio to 60 percent was replaced with a minimum ebitdatointerest ratio of 30 to 10 the ebitdatointerest ratio is defined in the amendment as the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the amendment for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period we believe the new covenant provides us greater financial flexibility separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1560 million  at september 30 2018  were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2018  and september 30 2017  were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2018  and september 30 2017  additional information related to our credit facilities is included in note 5 in the financial statements 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2018  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 4408 million  in 2018   351  per common share 3907 million  in 2017   304  per common share and 3782 million  in 2016   290  per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2018  is 092  per common share  368  per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2018  is as follows in millions 



 

 

 

 

 

 



supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period when we divest a business we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year excluding divestitures we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales in millions 





the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales in millions 





critical accounting estimates 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported these estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions but actual results could differ from those estimates refer to note 1 in the financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2018  was 1141 million  compared to 1759 million  in 2017  approximately 79 percent  of our 2018  global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2018  us pension expense included the following discount rate of 390 percent  compared to 375 percent  for 2017  and expected rate of return on plan assets of 750 percent  consistent with 2017  

for 2019  our us discount rate will increase to 435 percent  from 390 percent  in 2018  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

for 2019 our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain 750 percent  in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the financial markets produced positive returns in 2018  the plan’s debt securities return was positive the plan’s equity securities return was above the expected return range in 2018  as us and international equity returns were positive for the year the actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 788 percent  annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2018  and was approximately 746 percent  annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2018  

the target allocations and ranges of longterm expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 



the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation 

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 



1  change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition — customer incentives 

we offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional hardware and software products solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits customer incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional hardware and software products solutions and services to be provided we record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within customer returns rebates and incentives in our consolidated balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of receivables 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed our estimate is based primarily on historical experience if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 120 million  

more information regarding our revenue recognition and returns rebates and incentives policies are contained in note 1 in the financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 in the financial statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 220 million  and a liability of 72 million  at september 30 2018  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2018  the relative weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our sales and results of operations in 2017  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to 2018  levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 210 million  

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2018  or 2017  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 5500 million  at september 30 2018  with a weighted average interest rate of 227 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 26  days commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 3500 million  at september 30 2017  with a weighted average interest rate of 126 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 10  days we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our shortterm debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 12252 million  at september 30 2018  and 12434 million  at september 30 2017  the fair value of this debt was 13913 million  at september 30 2018  and 14526 million  at september 30 2017  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity 

in february 2015 we entered into interest rate swap contracts which we designated as fair value hedges these interest rate swaps effectively converted the 6000 million  aggregate principal amount of our 2050 percent  notes payable in march 2020 2020 notes and 2875 percent  notes payable in march 2025 2025 notes to floating rate debt each at a rate based on threemonth libor plus a fixed spread the effective floating interest rates were 2759 percent  for the 2020 notes and 3169 percent  for the 2025 notes at september 30 2018  the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at september 30 2018  was a net unrealized loss  of 240 million  a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our interest rate swaps would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays or defaults supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns arise companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 80  countries around the world approximately 45 percent  of our sales in 2017  were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline 

failures or security breaches of our products manufacturing environment or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it in our products solutions and services for customers manufacturing environment and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives despite the implementation of security measures it systems including our corporate enterprise systems manufacturing systems and industrial control systems such as those we sell and service are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors who may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage these systems are also vulnerable to malware including ransomware cyber attack and other events ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats recent global cyber attacks have been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widelyused software products increasing the risk of this potential threat in some cases these malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections 

our products solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft tampering or sabotage among other industries our products solutions and services are often employed in the control of critical infrastructure careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property while we continue to improve the security attributes of our products solutions and services we can reduce risk not eliminate it to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed installed protected configured updated and monitored much of which are typically outside our control 

our business uses it resources on a dispersed global basis for a wide variety of functions including development engineering manufacturing sales accounting and human resources our vendors partners employees and customers have access to and share information across multiple locations via various digital technologies in addition we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations also our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers employees and others 

our information security efforts under the leadership of our chief information security officer and chief product security officer with the support of the entire management team include major programs designed to address security governance product security identification and protection of critical assets insider risk thirdparty risk and cyber defense operations we believe these measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of an information security incident 

any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect   our results of operations 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification and labeling laws and regulations our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions changes in these requirements could impact demand for our products solutions and services 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation the domain expertise of our employees and partners product performance quality of our products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems in addition we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure if we fail to achieve our objectives to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products solutions and services we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters pandemics acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world natural disasters pandemics acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our business success depends on attracting developing and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance difficulty attracting developing and retaining members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit pension plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and health care trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits depend on laws and regulations which could change as well as health care cost inflation an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

we rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales 

in the united states and canada a large percentage of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors we depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our products and services and deliver value to our customers disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our products and services could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to various environmental regulations that are concerned with human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and water the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

failure to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions and technology investments may adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy we may pursue acquisitions of or investment opportunities in businesses as well as the purchase of technology from third parties in order to be successful with these transactions we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transaction and manage postclosing matters such as integration of the acquired business or technology we may not be able to identify or complete beneficial acquisition or transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions including 

 future acquisitions and technology investments could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products electronic components and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of sales

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2017  sales in the us accounted for 55 percent  of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2015  to 2017  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 all four indicators improved compared to the same quarter in the prior year with pmi and industrial equipment spending also improving sequentially 



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus economic trends 

in 2017  sales outside the us accounted for 45 percent  of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “overview” section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in the respective countries gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

having seen a return to industrial production growth in all regions in fiscal year 2017 further growth is forecast for fiscal year 2018 in europe business sentiment remains at high levels while in asia the macroeconomic environment is stable in latin america business confidence and investment levels in brazil are improving although growth is expected to slow in mexico industrial production and gdp growth in canada is expected to continue in fiscal year 2018 

summary of results of operations 

in 2017  sales were 63113 million  an increase of 73 percent  year over year organic sales increased 61 percent  currency translation reduced sales by 03 percentage points  and acquisitions contributed 15 percentage points  to sales growth growth was broadbased across regions and was led by strength in the automotive semiconductor and food and beverage industries 

the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives 



the following table reflects our sales and operating results for the years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions except per share amounts 





purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segments operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



the increases in nonoperating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2017  were primarily due to the decrease in our us discount rate from 455 percent for fiscal 2016 to 375 percent for fiscal 2017  

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension costs and their related income tax effects nonoperating pension costs include defined benefit plan interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements these components of net periodic pension cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations diluted eps and effective tax rate

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions which is a nongaap financial measure 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses operations and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations if any operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations if any are presented separately in our statement of cash flows in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we adopted a new sharebased compensation accounting standard that requires the excess income tax benefit from sharebased compensation to be classified as an operating rather than as a financing cash flow in previous periods we added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 no adjustment is necessary as this benefit is already included in operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 10340 million  for the year ended september 30 2017  compared to 9473 million  for the year ended september 30 2016  free cash flow was 8923 million  for the year ended september 30 2017  compared to 8337 million  for the year ended september 30 2016  the yearoveryear increases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to lower incentive compensation and income tax payments partially offset by a voluntary contribution of 2000 million to our us qualified pension plan in 2017  

we repurchased approximately 23 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2017  at a total cost of 3366 million  in 2016  we repurchased approximately 46 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of 5002 million  at september 30 2017  there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2016  there were 53 million  of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2017  our decision to repurchase shares in 2018  will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price on april 6 2016 the board of directors authorized us to expend an additional 10 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock at september 30 2017  we had approximately 6084 million  remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt including the current portion of longterm debt we expect capital expenditures in 2018  to be about 160 million  we expect to fund the 2500 million  current portion of long term debt due december 2017 with the issuance of commercial paper we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

given our extensive international operations significant amounts of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds are held by nonus subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested generally these funds would be subject to us tax if repatriated as of september 30 2017  substantially all of our funds were held by these nonus subsidiaries the percentage of these funds held by nonus subsidiaries can vary from quarter to quarter although substantially all of our funds were held by these nonus subsidiaries on average over the past eight quarters we have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 3500 million  at september 30 2017  with a weighted average interest rate of 126 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 10 days  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 4486 million  at september 30 2016  with a weighted average interest rate of 057 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 35 days  

at september 30 2017  and 2016  our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2020 was 10 billion  we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 3500 million  subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended september 30 2017  or 2016  in december 2016 we amended the financial covenant under this credit facility the previous financial covenant which limited our debttototalcapital ratio to 60 percent was replaced with a minimum ebitdatointerest ratio of 30 to 10 the ebitdatointerest ratio is defined in the amendment as the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the amendment for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period we believe the new covenant provides us greater financial flexibility separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1284 million  at september 30 2017  were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2017  and september 30 2016  were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2017  and september 30 2016  additional information related to our credit facilities is included in note 5 in the financial statements 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2017  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 3907 million  in 2017   304  per common share 3782 million  in 2016   290  per common share and 3501 million  in 2015   260  per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2017  is 076  per common share  304  per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2017  is as follows in millions 



 

 

 

 

 



supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period when we divest a business we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year excluding divestitures we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales in millions 





the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales in millions 





critical accounting estimates 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported these estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions but actual results could differ from those estimates refer to note 1 in the financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2017  was 1759 million  compared to 1613 million  in 2016  approximately 77 percent of our 2017  global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2017  us pension expense included the following discount rate of 375 percent  compared to 455 percent  for 2016  and expected rate of return on plan assets of 750 percent  compared to 750 percent  for 2016  

for 2018  our us discount rate will increase to 390 percent  from 375 percent  in 2017  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

for 2018  our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain 750 percent  in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the financial markets produced positive returns in 2017  the plan’s debt securities return was positive the plan’s equity securities return was above the expected return range in 2017  as us and international equity returns were positive for the year the actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 895 percent  annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2017  and was approximately 745 percent  annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2017  

the target allocations and ranges of longterm expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 



the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation 

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition — customer incentives 

we offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits customer incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products solutions and services to be provided we record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within customer returns rebates and incentives in our consolidated balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of receivables 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed our estimate is based primarily on historical experience if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 97 million  

more information regarding our revenue recognition and returns rebates and incentives policies are contained in note 1 in the financial statements 

income taxes —  undistributed earnings 

our annual tax rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us indefinite reinvestment is determined by managements judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company we have not provided us deferred taxes for 35260 million  of undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries since these earnings have been determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us and thus are not subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that may be payable upon distribution of these earnings 

more information regarding income taxes is contained in note 14 in the financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 135 million  and a liability of 364 million  at september 30 2017  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2017  and 2016  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to 2017  levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 214 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2017  or 2016  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 3500 million  at september 30 2017  with a weighted average interest rate of 126 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 10 days  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 4486 million  at september 30 2016  with a weighted average interest rate of 057 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 35 days  we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our shortterm debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 12434 million  at september 30 2017  and 15163 million  at september 30 2016  the fair value of this debt was 14526 million  at september 30 2017  and 17805 million  at september 30 2016  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of our longterm debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity 

in february 2015 we entered into interest rate swap contracts which we designated as fair value hedges these interest rate swaps effectively converted the 6000 million  aggregate principal amount of our 2050 percent  notes payable in march 2020 2020 notes and 2875 percent  notes payable in march 2025 2025 notes to floating rate debt each at a rate based on threemonth libor plus a fixed spread the effective floating interest rates were 1755 percent  for the 2020 notes and 2165 percent  for the 2025 notes at september 30 2017  the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at september 30 2017  was a net unrealized loss  of 46 million  a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our interest rate swaps would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based upon that evaluation management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2017  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2017  has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting in connection with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we expect to implement additional functionality within our enterprisewide information technology system which could result in enhancements and modifications to related internal controls over financial reporting during fiscal 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect us 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays or defaults supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns linger companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 80  countries around the world approximately 45 percent  of our sales in 2016  were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification and labeling laws and regulations our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions changes in these requirements could impact demand for our products solutions and services 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline 

failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise it systems these actors may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage 

our products solutions and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft tampering or sabotage among other industries our products solutions and services are often employed in the control of critical infrastructure careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property while we continue to improve the security attributes of our products solutions and services we can reduce risk not eliminate it to a significant extent the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are protected configured updated and monitored all of which are typically outside our control 

our business uses development engineering manufacturing sales accounting support and it resources on a dispersed global basis our vendors partners employees and customers have access to and share information across multiple locations via various digital technologies in addition we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations also our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers employees and others 

our information security efforts under the leadership of our chief information security officer with the support of the entire management team include major programs designed to address security governance identification of critical assets protection of critical assets the human elementinsider risk thirdparty relationships and cyber defense operations we believe these measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of an information security incident 

any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect   our results of operations 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation the domain expertise of our employees and partners product performance quality of our products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems in addition we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure if we fail to achieve our objectives to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products solutions and services we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters pandemics acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world natural disasters pandemics acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance difficulty attracting and retaining members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit pension plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and health care trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits depend on health care cost inflation an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to various environmental regulations that are concerned with human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our sales 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent  of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products electronic components and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of sales 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2016  sales in the us accounted for 55 percent  of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2014  to 2016  all macroeconomic indicators improved in the most recent quarter except for pmi indicating a recovery in the industrial economy although pmi declined in september the reading of 515 indicates that the manufacturing sector is continuing to expand 



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus economic trends 

in 2016  sales outside the us accounted for 45 percent  of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the overview section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in the respective countries gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

economic projections call for a higher rate of industrial production growth in all regions in 2017 except for europe the middle east and africa emea current economic projections indicate stable conditions in europe as we proceed into 2017 but with some uncertainty associated with the ultimate resolution of the united kingdom’s decision to exit the european union in asia pacific china’s economic growth continues to be impacted by elevated debt levels although industrial output and new orders growth have shown recent improvement the indian economy remains one of the fastest growing globally in latin america brazil remains in recession but with an improved outlook and mexico’s economy continues to be stable canada’s outlook has also improved as investment in resourcebased industries may have reached a bottom 

summary of results of operations 

in 2016  sales were 58795 million  a decrease of 68 percent  year over year organic sales decreased 39 percent  and currency translation reduced sales by 30 percentage points  growth in consumer and automotive industries was more than offset by declines in heavy industries particularly oil and gas and mining 

the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives 

 during 2016  we were able to hold pretax margin above 16 percent and segment operating margin above 20 percent despite difficult market conditions and lower reported sales 

the following table reflects our sales and operating results for the years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions except per share amounts 





purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segments operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



the increases in nonoperating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2016  were primarily due to our adoption of the new mortality table rp2014 and mortality improvement scale mp2014 used to measure net periodic pension cost for our us pension plans 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension costs and their related income tax effects nonoperating pension costs include defined benefit plan interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements these components of net periodic pension cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations diluted eps and effective tax rate

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions which is a nongaap financial measure 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap require the excess income tax benefit from sharebased compensation to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 9473 million  for the year ended september 30 2016  compared to 11877 million  for the year ended september 30 2015  free cash flow was 8337 million  for the year ended september 30 2016  compared to 10772 million  for the year ended september 30 2015  the yearoveryear decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow was primarily due to lower pretax income and less favorable working capital performance in 2016  compared to 2015  

we repurchased approximately 46 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2016  at a total cost of 5002 million  in 2015  we repurchased approximately 54 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of 6062 million  at september 30 2016  and 2015  there were 53 million  and 125 million  respectively of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until the next fiscal year our decision to repurchase shares in 2017  will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price on april 6 2016 the board of directors authorized us to expend an additional 10 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock at september 30 2016  we had approximately 9450 million  remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2017  to be about 150 million  we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

given our extensive international operations significant amounts of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds are held by nonus subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested generally these funds would be subject to us tax if repatriated as of september 30 2016  approximately 95 percent of our funds were held by these nonus subsidiaries the percentage of these funds held by nonus subsidiaries can vary from quarter to quarter with an average of approximately 90 percent over the past eight quarters we have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 4486 million  at september 30 2016  with a weighted average interest rate of 057 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 35 days  there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2015  our debttototalcapital ratio was 497 percent  at september 30 2016  and 399 percent  at september 30 2015  

at september 30 2016  and 2015  our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2020 was 10 billion  we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 3500 million  subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended september 30 2016  or 2015  separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1212 million  at september 30 2016  were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2016  and september 30 2015  were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2016  and september 30 2015  additional information related to our credit facilities is included in note 5 in the financial statements 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2016  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

from 1975 to 1989 rockwell international corporation ric operated the rocky flats facility in colorado for the us department of energy doe in 1990 a class of landowners near rocky flats sued ric and dow chemical another former operator of the facility in may 2016 the parties agreed to settle this case and the doe authorized the settlement under the settlement agreement which is subject to court approval we and dow chemical will pay 3750 million  in the aggregate to resolve the claims   we expect to be fully reimbursed by the doe for our obligation of 24375 million   under the settlement either before or after we pay the amounts due we expect to pay up to 2425 million  within the next 12 months we will promptly pursue reimbursement from the doe however it is uncertain whether the government indemnification and reimbursement process will be completed by the time payment is due  given our cash and credit resources we do not believe that the matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition refer to note 17 in the financial statements for further discussion of the rocky flats settlement 

cash dividends to shareowners were 3782 million  in 2016   290  per common share 3501 million  in 2015   260  per common share and 3205 million  in 2014   232  per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2016  is 0725  per common share  290  per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2016  is as follows in millions 



 

 



 

 

   



supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales in millions 





the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales in millions 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2016  was 1613 million  compared to 1457 million  in 2015  approximately 77  percent of our 2016  global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2016  us pension expense included the following discount rate of 455 percent  compared to 450 percent  for 2015  expected rate of return on plan assets of 750 percent  compared to 750 percent  for 2015  and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 375 percent  compared to 375 percent  for 2015  

in 2016  2015  and 2014  we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans 

the table below presents our estimate of net periodic benefit cost in 2017  compared to net periodic benefit cost in 2016  in millions 



for 2017  our us discount rate will decrease to 375 percent  from 455 percent  in 2016  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans for 2017  our us longterm compensation increase rate will decrease to 350 percent  from 375 percent  in 2016  we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings 

for 2017  our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain 750 percent  in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the financial markets produced positive returns in 2016  the plan’s debt securities return was positive and above the expected return range in 2016  as lower market interest rates resulted in a strong performance from bonds the plan’s equity securities return was above the expected return range in 2016  as us and international equity returns were positive for the year the actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 760 percent  annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2016  and was approximately 830 percent  annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2016  

the target allocations and ranges of longterm expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 



the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation 

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 11 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and products have been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others more information regarding our revenue recognition policies is contained in note 1 in the financial statements 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 79 million  

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products solutions and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1844 million  at september 30 2016  and 1814 million  at september 30 2015  of which 79 million  at september 30 2016  and 92 million  at september 30 2015  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate its value we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include expenses for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists we record the liability net of the estimated recovery if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing andor amount of future cash payments environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that the required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our accrual for environmental matters including environmental indemnification liabilities was 687 million  net of 222 million  of related receivables and 611 million  net of 329 million  of related receivables at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

one of our principal selfinsurance programs covers product liability where we selfinsure up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims including asbestos costs was 201 million  net of 111 million  of related receivables and 178 million  net of 104 million  of related receivables as of september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in note 14 in the financial statements within the section entitled other matters  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see note 14 in the financial statements for further discussion 

we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 07 million  and 04 million  in other current liabilities at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively and 199 million  and 198 million  in other liabilities at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

more information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 14 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

significant judgment is required in the determination of our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

deferred income taxes have been recorded for the temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider by jurisdiction all available positive and negative evidence including our recent historical operating results expected future taxable income scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and taxplanning strategies our assumptions about taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates of the underlying businesses we record a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

we conduct business globally and are routinely audited by the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction as well as inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments of taxes we record unrecognized tax liabilities when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 

we have not provided us deferred taxes for 32740 million  of undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries since these earnings have been determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us and thus are not subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that may be payable upon distribution of these earnings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 102 million  and a liability of 174 million  at september 30 2016  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2016  and 2015  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar further strengthens relative to 2016  levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 209 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2016  or 2015  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 4486 million  at september 30 2016  with a weighted average interest rate of 057 percent  and weighted average maturity period of 35 days  there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2015  we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our shortterm debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 15163 million  at september 30 2016  and 15009 million  at september 30 2015  the fair value of this debt was 17805 million  at september 30 2016  and 16826 million  at september 30 2015  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of our longterm debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity 

in february 2015 we entered into interest rate swap contracts which we designated as fair value hedges these interest rate swaps effectively converted the 6000 million  aggregate principal amount of our 2050 percent  notes payable in march 2020 2020 notes and 2875 percent  notes payable in march 2025 2025 notes to floating rate debt each at a rate based on threemonth libor plus a fixed spread the effective floating interest rates were 1281 percent  for the 2020 notes and 1691 percent  for the 2025 notes at september 30 2016  the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at september 30 2016  was a net unrealized gain of 195 million  a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our interest rate swaps would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect us 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns linger companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

a substantial portion of our sales are to customers outside the us and we are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 80  countries around the world approximately 45 percent  of our sales in 2015  were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification labeling and customer requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements changes in these requirements could impact demand for our products solutions and services 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline 

failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise it systems these actors may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage 

our portfolio of hardware and software products solutions and services and our enterprise it systems may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks pose a risk to the security of the products systems and networks of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through controls due diligence training surveillance and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of software hardware or a system that we sold or serviced could result in the disruption of our customers’ business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our enterprise it system could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products solutions and services that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect   our results of operations 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation product performance quality of our products solutions and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products solutions and services we may experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters pandemics acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters pandemics acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance competition for highly qualified management and technical personnel is particularly intense in emerging markets the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit pension plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and health care trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits depend on health care cost inflation an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our sales 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent  of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products which may include electronic components and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of sales 

we rely on strategic partners to expand our capabilities and to provide more complete automation solutions for our customers which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

we have relationships with industryleading strategic partners that provide complementary technology expertise and thought leadership to enable us to enhance automation solutions for our customers if we fail to maintain or manage relationships with these thirdparty partner companies effectively or these partners are unable or unwilling to perform as expected our ability to execute our business strategy could be negatively affected 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products solutions and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products solutions and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue to invest in initiatives to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2015  sales to us customers accounted for 55 percent  of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2013  to 2015  changes in these indicators from the most recent quarter are mixed while there was yearoveryear growth in ip in the fourth quarter ip growth decelerated throughout the quarter and is forecasted to be negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 industrial equipment spending grew year over year but was down sequentially in the fourth quarter capacity utilization was flat with the prior quarter and prior year pmi declined sharply and ended september only slightly above 50 



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus regional trends 

in 2015  sales to nonus customers accounted for 45 percent  of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the overview section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in the respective countries gross domestic product gdp and industrial production as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

overall economic projections call for a higher rate of industrial production growth in regions outside the us in 2016 compared to 2015 in europe the middle east and africa emea economic forecasts call for moderate growth in both western europe and emerging countries in asia pacific china’s economic growth is impacted by slowing investment declining exports and industrial overcapacity whereas the economy in india is slowly improving in latin america much of the region including brazil remains in recession but mexicos economy continues to be strong canada will continue to experience a low level of economic growth due to its exposure to resourcebased industries despite a mixed outlook for emerging markets in 2016 we continue to expect that these will be the fastest growing automation markets over the long term 

summary of results of operations 

in 2015  sales were 63079 million  a decrease of 48 percent  year over year organic sales increased 11 percent  and currency translation reduced sales by 60 percent  the modest organic growth was led by the consumer and automotive industries offset by significant headwinds from heavy industries particularly the oil and gas industry 

the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives 

 during 2015  we were able to expand segment operating margin by over one percentage point the favorable impact of strong productivity and organic growth was partially offset by higher spending and unfavorable currency effects 

the following tables reflect our sales and operating results for the years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions except per share amounts 



 20 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segments operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



the increases in nonoperating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2015  were primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure net periodic pension cost for our us pension plans the rate decreased from 505 percent  in 2014  to 450 percent  in 2015  

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension costs and their related income tax effects we define nonoperating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements these components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations diluted eps and effective tax rate 

  

the following are the components of operating and nonoperating pension costs for the years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions which is a nongaap financial measure 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap require the excess income tax benefit to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 11877 million  for the year ended september 30 2015  compared to 10333 million  for the year ended september 30 2014  free cash flow was 10772 million  for the year ended september 30 2015  compared to 9222 million  for the year ended september 30 2014  the increase in the cash flow provided by operating activities and the increase in free cash flow are primarily due to strong working capital performance 

we repurchased approximately 54 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2015  the total cost of these shares was 6062 million  of which 125 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2015  related to 124400  shares that did not settle until october 2015  in 2014  we repurchased approximately 41 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program the total cost of these shares was 4838 million  of which 45 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2014  related to 40757  shares that did not settle until october 2014  our decision to repurchase stock in 2016  will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price at september 30 2015  we had approximately 4452 million  remaining for stock repurchases under the 10 billion share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors in 2014 see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2016  to be about 150 million  we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

given our extensive operations outside the us a significant amount of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds are held in nonus subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested generally these funds would be subject to us tax if repatriated as of september 30 2015  approximately 90 percent of our funds were held in these nonus subsidiaries the percentage of these nonus funds can vary from quarter to quarter with an average of approximately 90 percent over the past eight quarters we have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 

in february 2015 we issued 6000 million  of aggregate principal amount of longterm notes in a public offering this debt offering yielded 5943 million  in net proceeds we used the net proceeds from the offering primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes upon issuance of these notes we entered into fixedtofloating interest rate swap contracts with multiple banks that effectively converted the notes to floating rate debt each series at a rate based on threemonth libor plus a fixed spread additional information related to our longterm debt and interest rate swap contracts is included in note 5 and note 8 of the financial statements respectively 

our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2015  at september 30 2014  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 3250 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  and weighted average maturity period of seven days  our debttototalcapital ratio was 399 percent  at september 30 2015  and 316 percent  at september 30 2014  the increase in the debttototalcapital ratio is primarily due to an increase in debt and a decrease in equity the decrease in equity is primarily due to pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments and currency translation adjustments during the year 

on march 24 2015 we replaced our former fiveyear 7500 million  unsecured revolving credit facility with a new fiveyear 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2020 we have not borrowed against either credit facility during the periods ended september 30 2015  or september 30 2014  separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1212 million  at september 30 2015  were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities at september 30 2015  and september 30 2014  were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30 2015  and september 30 2014  additional information related to our credit facilities is included in note 5 of the financial statements 

among other uses we can draw on our 10 billion  credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2015  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain nonus subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the us dollar in addition we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 3501 million  in 2015   260  per common share 3205 million  in 2014   232  per common share and 2763 million  in 2013   198  per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2015  is 065  per common share  260  per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2015  are in millions

supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales in millions 





the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales in millions 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2015  was 1457 million  compared to 1317 million  in 2014  approximately 69  percent of our 2015  global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2015  us pension expense included the following discount rate of 450 percent  compared to 505 percent  for 2014  expected rate of return on plan assets of 750 percent  compared to 750 percent  for 2014  and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 375 percent  compared to 375 percent  for 2014  

in 2015  2014  and 2013  we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans 

the table below presents our estimate of net periodic benefit cost in 2016  compared to net periodic benefit cost in 2015  in millions 



for 2016  our us discount rate will increase to 455 percent  from 450 percent  in 2015  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans for 2016  our us longterm compensation increase rate will remain 375 percent  we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings 

for 2016  our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain 750 percent  in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the financial markets produced mixed results in 2015  the plan’s debt securities return was positive but below the expected return range in 2015  as lower market interest rates resulted in low single digit bond returns the plan’s equity securities return was below the expected return range in 2015  as us and international equity returns were negative for the year the actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 590 percent  annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2015  and was approximately 840 percent  annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2015  

the target allocations and ranges of longterm expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 



the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation 

the following chart illustrates the estimated approximate change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 11 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and products have been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered within this category we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products andor the performance of services such as installation and commissioning the timing of delivery though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component is generally shortterm in nature for these arrangements revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that elements relative selling price provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendorspecific objective evidence which is based on our separate selling price for that or a similar item or from thirdparty evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items if such evidence is not available we use our best estimate of the selling price which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of a sales agreement we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 112 million  

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1814 million  at september 30 2015  and 1956 million  at september 30 2014  of which 92 million  at september 30 2015  and 116 million  at september 30 2014  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate its value we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include expenses for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists we record the liability net of the estimated recovery if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing andor amount of future cash payments environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that the required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our accrual for environmental matters including certain environmental indemnification liabilities that are substantially indemnified by exxonmobil corporation was 545 million  net of 329 million  of related receivables and 482 million  net of 397 million  of related receivables at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

one of our principal selfinsurance programs covers product liability where we selfinsure up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims including asbestos costs was 178 million  net of 104 million  of related receivables and 148 million  net of 75 million  of related receivables as of september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in note 14 of the financial statements within the section entitled other matters  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see note 14 of the financial statements for further discussion 

we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 04 million  and 03 million  in other current liabilities at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively and 198 million  and 219 million  in other liabilities at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 66 million  of which 10 million  and 08 million  has been accrued in other current liabilities at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively and 56 million  and 70 million  has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates 

more information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 14 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and nonus taxing authorities additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the ambiguity of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge crossjurisdictional transactions crossjurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax reserves the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 439 million  and 389 million  at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively of which the entire amount would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were 51 million  and 81 million  at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized the net impact on our income tax provision including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets would be 265 million  as of september 30 2015  we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced  by up to 310 million  in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized the net reduction to our income tax provision including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets could be up to 145 million  

we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss tax credit and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 222 million  at september 30 2015  and 278 million  at september 30 2014  based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected conversely our income would decrease if we determine we are unable to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 

our consolidated financial statements provide for tax liability on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries that will be repatriated to the us as of september 30 2015  we have not provided us deferred taxes for 30590 million  of such earnings since these earnings have been and under current plans will continue to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 546 million  and a liability of 185 million  at september 30 2015  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2015  and 2014  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar further strengthens relative to 2015  levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 136 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately there was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2015  or 2014  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations are primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2015  at september 30 2014  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 3250 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  and weighted average maturity period of seven days  we have issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations as needed changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our shortterm debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 15009 million  at september 30 2015  and 9004 million  at september 30 2014  the fair value of this debt was 16826 million  at september 30 2015  and 11194 million  at september 30 2014  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of our longterm debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity 

in february 2015 we entered into interest rate swap contracts which we designated as fair value hedges these interest rate swaps effectively converted the 6000 million  aggregate principal amount of our 2050  notes payable in march 2020 2020 notes and 2875  notes payable in march 2025 2025 notes to floating rate debt each at a rate based on threemonth libor plus a fixed spread the effective floating interest rates were 0763 percent  for the 2020 notes and 1173 percent  for the 2025 notes at september 30 2015  the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts at september 30 2015  was a net unrealized gain of 54 million  a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our interest rate swaps would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns linger companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

a substantial portion of our sales are to customers outside the us and we are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 80 countries around the world approximately 48 percent  of our sales in 2014  were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification labeling and customer requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements changes in these requirements could impact demand for our products solutions and services 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline 

failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise it systems these actors may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage 

our portfolio of hardware and software products solutions and services and our enterprise it systems may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks pose a risk to the security of the products systems and networks of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through controls due diligence training surveillance and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of software hardware or a system that we sold or serviced could result in the disruption of our customers’ business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our enterprise it system could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products services and solutions that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices 

we have nearly completed the process of developing and directing the implementation of a common global enterprise resource planning erp system that has resulted in redesigned processes organization structures and a common information system all with the objective of improving internal control and our ability to manage and monitor our global operations the implementations which were initiated by rockwell automation inc the us parent company of our consolidated group occurred in many locations from 2007 to 2014  as the parent company completes this integration the system and processes may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect   our results of operations 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation product performance quality of our products and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters pandemics acts of war terrorism international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters pandemics acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance competition for highly qualified management and technical personnel is particularly intense in emerging markets the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit pension plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates the value of plan assets mortality assumptions and health care trend rates significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits depend on health care cost inflation an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our sales 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent  of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

we rely on suppliers to provide equipment components and services which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products which may include electronic components and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of sales 

we rely on strategic partners to expand our capabilities and to provide more complete automation solutions for our customers which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

 we have relationships with industryleading strategic partners that provide complementary technology expertise and thought leadership to enable us to enhance automation solutions for our customers if we fail to maintain or manage relationships with these thirdparty partner companies effectively or these partners are unable or unwilling to perform as expected our ability to execute our business strategy could be negatively affected 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue to invest in initiatives to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we operate manufacturing facilities in the united states and multiple other countries manufacturing space occupied approximately 34 million square feet of which 35 percent was in the united states and canada our global headquarters are located in milwaukee wisconsin in a facility that we own we lease the remaining facilities noted below most of our facilities are shared by operations in both segments and may be used for multiple purposes such as administrative manufacturing warehousing and  or distribution 

the following table sets forth information regarding our headquarter locations as of september 30 2014  



there are no major encumbrances other than financing arrangements which in the aggregate are not significant on any of our plants or equipment in our opinion our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 




 

item 3 legal proceedings 

asbestos  we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against ric’s divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company nationwide and kemper insurance kemper the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims we believe this arrangement will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

other  various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

global expansion 

as the manufacturing world continues to expand we must be able to meet our customers’ needs around the world we continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets we currently have approximately 60 percent  of our employees outside the us and 48 percent  of our sales outside the us 

as we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions we have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing product development and customer facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world growth in the emerging markets of asia pacific including china and india latin america central and eastern europe and africa is projected to exceed global gross domestic product gdp growth rates due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middleclass population we believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future 

enhanced market access 

over the past decade our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to over 90 billion our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity logix is the technology foundation that enabled us to become an industry leader for batch process applications and to compete effectively with traditional distributed control systems dcs providers for continuous process applications we complement that with a growing global network of engineers and partners to provide solutions to process customers

broad range of industries served 

we apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products resourcebased and transportation 

our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage home and personal care and life sciences industries these customers’ needs include new capacity incremental capacity from existing facilities flexible manufacturing and regulatory compliance these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors 

we serve customers in resourcebased industries including oil and gas mining aggregates cement metals energy pulp and paper and waterwastewater companies in these industries typically invest in capacity expansion when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is increasing in addition there is ongoing investment in upgrades of aging automation systems and productivity 

in the transportation industry factors such as geographic expansion investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers’ automation investment decisions our sales in transportation are primarily to automotive and tire manufacturers 

outsourcing and sustainability trends 

demand for our products solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally 

we help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency environmental and safety goals higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to invest in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor control and energy efficient solutions and services in addition environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices 

acquisitions 

our acquisition strategy focuses on products solutions or services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings in january 2014 we acquired jacobs automation a leader in intelligent track motion control technology this technology improves performance across a wide range of packaging material handling and other applications for the global machine builder market 

in november 2013 we acquired vmonitor llc and its affiliates a global technology leader for wireless solutions in the oil and gas industry this acquisition is expected to strengthen our ability to deliver endtoend projects for the oil and gas sector and accelerate our development of similar process solutions and remote monitoring services for water  wastewater mining and other industries globally 

in october 2012 we acquired certain assets of the medium voltage drives business of harbin jiuzhou electric co ltd a leading manufacturer of medium voltage drives direct current power supplies switch gear and wind inverters headquartered in harbin china the acquisition strengthened our presence in the asiapacific motor control market by adding significant capabilities in design engineering and manufacturing of medium voltage drive products 

in march 2012 we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of softswitching technologies corporation an industrial power quality detection and protection systems provider in the united states 

we believe the acquired companies will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers 

continuous improvement 

productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity we are in the process of developing and implementing common global processes and an enterprisewide business system these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2014  sales to us customers accounted for 52 percent  of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2012  to 2014  the pmi increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 indicates expansion in the us manufacturing sector industrial equipment spending and the industrial production index have been improving while capacity utilization remained flat strength in the recently reported macroeconomic indicators supports our expectation that market conditions in the us will remain healthy next year though ip growth is expected to be somewhat lower we expect the us growth in fiscal 2015  to be slightly lower than in fiscal 2014  



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus regional trends 

in 2014  sales to nonus customers accounted for 48 percent  of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the overview section international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets we use changes in the respective countries gross domestic product gdp and industrial production as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business 

overall economic projections call for higher rates of industrial production growth in regions outside the us in 2015 compared to 2014 however market conditions are expected to be mixed across and within regions in europe economic forecasts call for little to no growth in western europe and moderate growth in emerging countries in asia pacific china’s economic picture is mixed overcapacity and lack of liquidity are threats but exports and production are expected to improve in latin america brazil is in a recession but mexicos economy remains strong canada is expected to have continued low levels of economic growth as weak commodity prices weigh on investment in resourcebased industries despite these current headwinds and inherently greater volatility of their economic conditions we continue to expect that emerging markets will be the fastest growing automation markets over the long term 

summary of results of operations 

in 2014  we achieved record sales of 66235 million  with sales growth of 43 percent  year over year organic sales increased 51 percent  all regions except for canada experienced organic sales growth year over year led by the united states with organic sales growth of 68 percent  the end market with the strongest sales growth for the year was oil and gas 

the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives 

 for the second year in a row we expanded segment operating margin by almost a point while continuing to invest for growth 

the following tables reflect our sales and operating results for the years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions except per share amounts 



 22 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segments operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



the decreases in nonoperating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2014  were primarily due to the increase in the discount rate used to measure net periodic pension cost for our us pension plans the rate increased from 415 percent  in 2013  to 505 percent  in 2014  

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension costs and their related income tax effects we define nonoperating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements these components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations diluted eps and effective tax rate 

  

the following are the components of operating and nonoperating pension costs for the years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions which is a nongaap financial measure 



our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap require the excess income tax benefit to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 10333 million  for the year ended september 30 2014  compared to 10148 million  for the year ended september 30 2013  free cash flow was a source of 9222 million  for the year ended september 30 2014  compared to a source of 9005 million  for the year ended september 30 2013  the increase in the cash flow provided by operating activities and the increase in free cash flow are primarily due to higher earnings largely offset by higher tax payments 

we repurchased approximately 41 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2014  the total cost of these shares was 4838 million  of which 45 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2014  related to 40757  shares that did not settle until october 2014  in 2013  we repurchased approximately 47 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program the total cost of these shares was 4015 million  of which 64 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2013  related to 60000  shares that did not settle until october 2013  our decision to repurchase stock in 2015  will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price at september 30 2014  we had approximately 10514 million  remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorizations see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2015  to be about 150 million we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

given our extensive operations outside the us a significant amount of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds are held in nonus subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested generally these funds would be subject to us tax if repatriated the percentage of such nonus funds can vary from quarter to quarter with an average of approximately 90 percent over the past eight quarters as of september 30 2014  approximately 90 percent of our funds were held in such nonus subsidiaries we have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2014  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 3250 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  and weighted average maturity period of seven days  at september 30 2013  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 1790 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  and weighted average maturity period of five days  our debttototalcapital ratio was 316 percent  at september 30 2014  and 295 percent  at september 30 2013  the increase in the debttototalcapital ratio is primarily due to higher commercial paper balances 

at september 30 2014  and 2013  our total borrowing capacity under our fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in may 2018  was 7500 million  we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 2500 million  subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we have not borrowed against this credit facility during the years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period borrowings are outstanding the terms of this credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent  separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1266 million  at september 30 2014  were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities during fiscal 2014  and 2013  were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities during the years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  there were no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2014  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years we also enter into these contracts to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities functional currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 3205 million  in 2014   232  per common share 2763 million  in 2013   198  per common share and 2474 million  in 2012   1745  per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2014  is 058  per common share  232  per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2014  are in millions

supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to organic sales in millions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2014  was 1317 million  compared to 1681 million  in 2013  approximately 72  percent of our 2014  global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2014  us pension expense included the following discount rate of 505 percent  compared to 415 percent  for 2013  expected rate of return on plan assets of 750 percent  compared to 800 percent  for 2013  and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 375 percent  compared to 400 percent  for 2013  

in 2014  2013  and 2012  we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary contributions of 3000 million  to our us pension plans in 2012  

the table below presents our estimate of net periodic benefit cost in 2015  compared to net periodic benefit cost in 2014  in millions 



 for 2015  our us discount rate will decrease to 450 percent  from 505 percent  in 2014  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans for 2015  our us longterm compensation increase rate will remain 375 percent  we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings 

for 2015  our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain 750 percent  in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plans’ invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the financial markets produced strong results in 2014  the plan’s debt securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2014  as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values the plan’s equity securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2014  largely due to higher us equity returns the actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 720 percent  annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2014  and was approximately 950 percent  annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2014  

the target allocations and ranges of longterm expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 



the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation 

the following chart illustrates the estimated approximate change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 



1 change includes both operating and nonoperating pension costs 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 11 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered within this category we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products andor the performance of services such as installation and commissioning the timing of delivery though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component is generally shortterm in nature for these arrangements revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that elements relative selling price provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendorspecific objective evidence which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from thirdparty evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items if such evidence is not available we use our best estimate of the selling price which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of a sales agreement we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 108 million  

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1956 million  at september 30 2014  and 1840 million  at september 30 2013  of which 116 million  at september 30 2014  and 89 million  at september 30 2013  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate its value we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include expenses for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists we record the liability net of the estimated recovery if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing andor amount of future cash payments environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that the required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our accrual for environmental matters was 482 million  net of 397 million  of related receivables and 475 million  net of 351 million  of related receivables at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 223 million  and 210 million  as of september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion 

we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 03 million  and 23 million  in other current liabilities at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively and 219 million  and 220 million  in other liabilities at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 92 million  of which 08 million  and 03 million  has been accrued in other current liabilities at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively and 70 million  and 92 million  has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates 

more information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 14 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and nonus taxing authorities additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the ambiguity of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge crossjurisdictional transactions crossjurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax reserves the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 389 million  and 408 million  at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively of which the entire amount would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were 81 million  and 124 million  at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized the net impact on our income tax provision including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets would be 229 million  as of september 30 2014  we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced  by up to 238 million  in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized the net reduction to our income tax provision including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets could be up to 91 million  

we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss tax credit and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 278 million  at september 30 2014  and 283 million  at september 30 2013  based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected conversely our income would decrease if we determine we are unable to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 

our consolidated financial statements provide for tax liability on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries that will be repatriated to the us as of september 30 2014  we have not provided us deferred taxes for 27810 million  of such earnings since these earnings have been and under current plans will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the us 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 216 million  and a liability of 62 million  at september 30 2014  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2014  and 2013  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar further strengthens relative to 2014  levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 297 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2014  and 2013  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2014  were 3250 million  with remaining maturities of seven days  at a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  commercial paper borrowings at september 30 2013  were 1790 million  with remaining maturities of five days  at a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2014  and 2013  a 100 basis point increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by 28 million and 21 million respectively 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 9056 million  at september 30 2014  and 9051 million  at september 30 2013  the fair value of this debt was 11194 million  at september 30 2014  and 10722 million  at september 30 2013  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns linger companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

a substantial portion of our sales are to customers outside the us and we are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

we do business in more than 80 countries around the world approximately 50 percent  of our sales in 2013  were to customers outside the us in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in nonus markets our global operations are subject to numerous financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability prevalence of corruption in certain countries enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls product content and performance employment and repatriation of earnings in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification labeling and customer requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline 

failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise it systems these threat actors may engage in fraud theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage 

our portfolio of hardware and software products solutions and services and our enterprise it systems may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks have sometimes been successful 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of software hardware or a system that we sold or serviced could result in the disruption of our customers’ business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our enterprise it system could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

we are in the process of developing and directing the implementation of a common global enterprise resource planning erp system that is resulting in redesigned processes organization structures and a common information system all with the objective of improving internal control and our ability to manage and monitor our global operations the implementations which were initiated by rockwell automation inc the us parent company of our consolidated group occurred in many locations in 2007 to 2013  and are scheduled to continue into 2015 as the parent company continues to drive this implementation the system and processes may not perform as expected or may require more time to implement this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification including defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks we could incur cost overruns liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect   our results of operations 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation product performance quality of our products and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion lower sales and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims by taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel while appropriately managing costs related to employee benefits 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits 

the amount of expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans depends on factors such as changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets significant decreases in market interest rates or the value of plan assets would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits continue to increase as well 

increasing employee benefit costs or the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products solutions and services we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our sales 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent  of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our sales a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

we rely on vendors to supply equipment components and services which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our business requires that we buy equipment components and services including finished products which may include computer chips and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of sales 

we rely on strategic partners to expand our capabilities and to provide more complete automation solutions for our customers which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

 we have relationships with industryleading strategic partners that provide complementary technology expertise and thought leadership to enable us to enhance automation solutions for our customers if we fail to maintain or manage relationships with these thirdparty partner companies effectively or these partners are unable or unwilling to perform as expected our ability to execute our business strategy could be negatively affected 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue to invest in initiatives to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we operate manufacturing facilities in the united states and multiple other countries manufacturing space occupied approximately 34 million square feet of which 36 percent was in the united states and canada our global headquarters are located in milwaukee wisconsin in a facility that we own we lease the remaining facilities noted below most of our facilities are shared by operations in both segments and may be used for multiple purposes such as administrative manufacturing warehousing and  or distribution 

the following table sets forth information regarding our headquarter locations as of september 30 2013  



there are no major encumbrances other than financing arrangements which in the aggregate are not significant on any of our plants or equipment in our opinion our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 




 

item 3 legal proceedings 

asbestos  we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against ric’s divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company nationwide and kemper insurance kemper the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims we believe this arrangement will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

other  various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

despite sluggish market conditions in 2013  we achieved record sales of 63519 million  with sales growth of 15 percent  year over year all regions except for asia pacific experienced sales growth year over year led by latin america with organic sales growth of 12 percent the end market with the strongest sales growth for the year was oil and gas 

results for our key initiatives were mixed 

 in a low growth environment we were able to expand segment operating margin by almost a point while continuing to invest for growth 

the effective tax rate in 2013  was 229 percent  compared to 237 percent  in 2012  the adjusted effective tax rate in 2013  was 239 percent  compared to 241 percent  in 2012  we recognized net discrete tax benefits of 227 million  in 2013  primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the retroactive extension of the us federal research and development tax credit we recognized net discrete tax benefits of 21 million  in 2012  primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions 

the following tables reflect our sales and operating results for the years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions except per share amounts

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and nonoperating pension costs are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segments operating performance for internal purposes if we were to allocate these costs we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows in millions 



the increases in nonoperating pension costs in both segments in fiscal 2013  were primarily due to the decrease in our us discount rate from 520 percent in 2012  to 415 percent in 2013  

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation 

adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are nongaap earnings measures that exclude nonoperating pension costs and their related income tax effects we define nonoperating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements these components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business we believe that adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period our measures of adjusted income adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations diluted eps and effective tax rate

general corporate  net expenses were 972 million  in fiscal 2013  compared to 829 million  in fiscal 2012  the largest contributor to the yearoveryear increase was higher legacy environmental charges 

income from continuing operations before income taxes 

income from continuing operations before income taxes increased   2 percent  from 9659 million  in 2012  to 9809 million  in 2013  the increase was primarily due to an increase in segment operating earnings partially offset by higher nonoperating pension costs total segment operating earnings increased   6 percent  year over year primarily due to higher sales and strong productivity

the effective tax rate for 2013  was 229 percent  compared to 237 percent  in 2012  the 2013  and 2012  effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent  because our sales outside of the us benefited from lower tax rates the adjusted effective tax rate in 2013  was 239 percent  compared to 241 percent  in 2012  we recognized net discrete tax benefits of 227 million  in 2013  primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the retroactive extension of the us federal research and development tax credit we recognized net discrete tax benefits of 21 million  in 2012  primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions

the effective tax rate for 2012 was 237 percent compared to 197 percent in 2011 the 2012 and 2011 effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent because our sales outside of the us benefited from lower tax rates

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thus does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows our accounting for sharebased compensation requires us to report the related excess income tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

cash provided by operating activities was 10148 million  for the year ended september 30 2013  compared to 7187 million  for the year ended september 30 2012  free cash flow was a source of 9005 million  for the year ended september 30 2013  compared to a source of 5976 million  for the year ended september 30 2012  the increase in the cash flow provided by operating activities and the increase in free cash flow are primarily due to a 300 million discretionary pretax contribution to our us qualified pension trust partially offset by a related tax benefit made in 2012  and lower incentive compensation payments in 2013  

we repurchased approximately 47 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2013  the total cost of these shares was 4015 million  of which 64 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2013  related to 60000  shares that did not settle until october 2013  in 2012  we repurchased approximately 37 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program the total cost of these shares was 2653 million  of which 76 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2012  related to 110000  shares that did not settle until october 2012  our decision to repurchase stock in 2014  will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price at september 30 2013  we had approximately 5351 million  remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2014  to be about 170 million we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

given our extensive operations outside the us a significant amount of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds are held in nonus subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested generally these funds would be subject to us tax if repatriated the percentage of such nonus funds can vary from quarter to quarter with an average of approximately 90 percent over the past eight quarters as of september 30 2013  approximately 90 percent of our funds were held in such nonus subsidiaries we have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2013  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 1790 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  at september 30 2012  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 1570 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 027 percent  our debttototalcapital ratio was 295 percent  at september 30 2013  and 364 percent  at september 30 2012  the decrease in the debttototalcapital ratio is primarily due to higher shareowners equity resulting from yearend pension adjustments for actuarial gains due to increase in the discount rate 

on may 22 2013  we replaced our former fouryear 7500 million  unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2015  with a new fiveyear 7500 million  unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in may 2018  we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to 2500 million subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility we did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the former credit facility we have not borrowed against these credit facilities during the years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent  separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1216 million  at september 30 2013  were available to nonus subsidiaries borrowings under our nonus credit facilities during fiscal 2013  and 2012  were not significant we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities during the years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  there were no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2013  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

we enter into contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 2763 million  in 2013   198  per common share 2474 million  in 2012   1745  per common share and 2110 million  in 2011   1475  per common share our quarterly dividend rate as of september 30 2013  is 052  per common share  208  per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2013  are in millions

supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year when we acquire businesses we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to organic sales in millions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2013  was 1681 million  compared to 1047 million  in 2012  approximately 77  percent of our 2013  global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2013  us pension expense included the following discount rate of 415 percent  compared to 520 percent  for 2012  expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent  compared to 800 percent  for 2012  and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 400 percent  compared to 400 percent  for 2012  

in 2013  2012  and 2011  we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary contributions of 3000 million  and 1500 million  to our us pension plans in 2012  and 2011  respectively 

the table below presents our estimate of net periodic benefit cost in 2014  compared to net periodic benefit cost in 2013  in millions 



 for 2014  our us discount rate will increase to 505 percent  from 415 percent  in 2013  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans our us longterm compensation increase rate will decrease to 375 percent  for 2014  from 400 percent  in 2013  we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings 

for 2014 our expected rate of return on us plan assets will decrease to 750 percent  from 800 percent  in 2013  reflecting lower future expected market returns in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plans’ invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the financial markets produced strong results in 2013  the plan’s debt securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2013  as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values the plan’s equity securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2013  largely due to higher us equity returns the actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 730 percent  annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2013  and was approximately 890 percent  annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2013  

the target allocations and ranges of longterm expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 



the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation 

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 



more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered within this category we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products andor the performance of services such as installation and commissioning the timing of delivery though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component is generally shortterm in nature for these arrangements revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that elements relative selling price provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from thirdparty evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items if such evidence is not available we use our best estimate of the selling price which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 108 million  

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1840 million  at september 30 2013  and 1766 million  at september 30 2012  of which 89 million  at september 30 2013  and 79 million  at september 30 2012  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate its value we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include expenses for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists we record the liability net of the estimated recovery if we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing andor amount of future cash payments environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that the required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our accrual for environmental matters was 475 million  net of 351 million  of related receivables and 452 million  net of 321 million  of related receivables at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 210 million  and 223 million  as of september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion 

we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 23 million  and 34 million  in other current liabilities at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively and 220 million  and 224 million  in other liabilities at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 114 million  of which 03 million  and 16 million  has been accrued in other current liabilities at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively and 92 million  and 88 million  has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates 

more information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 16 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and nonus taxing authorities additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 408 million  and 703 million  at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively of which the entire amount would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were 124 million  and 201 million  at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized the net impact on our income tax provision including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets would be 271 million  as of september 30 2013  we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced  by up to 164 million  in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations 

we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss tax credit and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 283 million  at september 30 2013  and 318 million  at september 30 2012  based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected conversely our income would decrease if we determine we are unable to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 

our consolidated financial statements provide for tax liability on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries that will be repatriated to the us as of september 30 2013  we have not provided us deferred taxes for 24270 million  of such earnings since these earnings have been and under current plans will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the us 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 106 million  and a liability of 117 million  at september 30 2013  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2013  and 2012  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar further strengthens relative to 2013  levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 15 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2013  and 2012  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2013  were 1790 million  with remaining maturities of five days  at a weighted average interest rate of 017 percent  commercial paper borrowings at september 30 2012  were 1570 million  with remaining maturities of six days  at a weighted average interest rate of 027 percent  as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2013  and 2012  a 100 basis point increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by 21 million and 27 million respectively 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 9051 million  at september 30 2013  and 9050 million  at september 30 2012  the fair value of this debt was 10722 million  at september 30 2013  and 11879 million  at september 30 2012  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2013  has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

as previously disclosed we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprisewide information technology system additional implementations will occur at the remaining locations of our company throughout fiscal 20142015

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our revenues and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns linger companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

approximately 51 percent  of our revenues in 2012  were made outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on growth in our international sales numerous risks and uncertainties affect our international operations these risks and uncertainties include increased financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls employment regulations repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification labeling and customer requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline 

failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals and other attacks targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and service and corporate enterprise it systems 

our portfolio of hardware and software products solutions and services and our enterprise it systems may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks have sometimes been successful 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of software hardware or a system that we sold or serviced could result in the disruption of our customers’ business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our enterprise it system could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on revenue harm our reputation cause us to incur legal liability and cause us to incur increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

we are implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that is resulting in redesigned processes organization structures and a common information system significant rollouts of the system occurred at our us locations and certain nonus locations in 2007 to 2012  and are scheduled to continue at additional locations in 2013  and beyond as we continue to implement new systems they may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are inherent risks in our solutions businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the quality of our subcontractors and suppliers if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation product performance quality of our products and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion lower revenues and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims by taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel while appropriately managing costs related to employee benefits 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits 

the amount of expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans depends on factors such as changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets significant decreases in market interest rates or the value of plan assets would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits continue to increase as well 

increasing employee benefit costs or the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to the safety and security of the products services and solutions we sell employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our revenues 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent  of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our revenues a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

we rely on vendors to supply equipment and components which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our business requires that we buy equipment and components including finished products which may include computer chips and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers of these items involves certain risks including 

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue to invest in initiatives to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets

 item 2 properties 

we operate manufacturing facilities in the united states and multiple foreign countries manufacturing space occupied approximately 33 million  square feet of which 37 percent  was in the united states and canada our global headquarters are located in milwaukee wisconsin in a facility that we own we lease the remaining facilities noted below most of our facilities are shared by operations in both segments and may be used for multiple purposes such as administrative manufacturing warehousing and  or distribution 

the following table sets forth information regarding our headquarter locations as of september 30 2012  



there are no major encumbrances other than financing arrangements which in the aggregate are not significant on any of our plants or equipment in our opinion our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

mcgregor texas nwirp facility environmental claim  ric operated the naval weapons industrial reserve plant nwirp in mcgregor texas from 1958 through 1978 for the united states navy incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the nwirp to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on december 3 2007 the united states department of justice doj notified ric that the united states navy was seeking to recover environmental cleanup costs incurred at the nwirp the doj asserted that it has incurred more than 50 million excluding interest attorneys’ fees and other indirect costs in environmental cleanup costs at the nwirp and it believes that it may have a potential cause of action against ric and other former contractors at the nwirp for recovery of those costs in june 2011 ric and one other former contractor at the nwirp reached a settlement with the doj and the united states navy to resolve all claims in exchange for payment of 14 million ric will be responsible for half of the settlement amount the parties negotiated the terms of a consent decree that was reviewed and approved by the doj the consent decree was submitted to the district court for approval and was approved on september 30 2012 thereby completely resolving this claim 

asbestos  we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against ric’s divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company nationwide and kemper insurance kemper the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims we believe this arrangement will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

other  various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

our customers face the challenge of remaining globally cost competitive and automation can help them achieve their productivity and sustainability objectives our value proposition is to help our customers reduce time to market lower total cost of ownership improve asset utilization and manage enterprise risks 

differentiation through technology and domain expertise 

we seek a technology leadership position in industrial automation we believe that our three platforms  integrated architecture intelligent motor control and solutions and services  provide the foundation for longterm sustainable growth 

our integrated control and information architecture with logix at its core is an important differentiator we are the only automation provider that can support discrete process batch safety motion and motor control on the same hardware platform with the same software programming environment our integrated architecture is scalable with standard open communications protocols making it easier for customers to implement more cost effectively 

intelligent motor control is one of our core competencies and an important aspect of an automation system these products and solutions enhance the availability efficiency and safe operation of our customers critical and most energyintensive plant assets our intelligent motor control offering can be integrated seamlessly with the logix architecture 

domain expertise refers to solutions and services that we provide to support customers through the entire life cycle of their automation investment the combination of industryspecific domain expertise of our people with our innovative technologies enables us to help our customers solve their manufacturing and business challenges 

global expansion 

as the manufacturing world continues to expand we must be able to meet our customers’ needs in emerging markets we continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets we currently have approximately 60 percent  of our employees outside the us and 51 percent  of our revenues outside of the us 

as we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions we have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing product development and customer facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world growth in the emerging markets of asiapacific including china and india latin america central and eastern europe and africa is projected to exceed global gross domestic product gdp growth rates due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middleclass population we believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future 

enhanced market access 

over the past decade our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to approximately 80 billion our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity logix is the technology foundation that enabled us to become an industry leader for batch process applications and to compete effectively with traditional distributed control systems dcs providers for continuous process applications we complement that with a growing global network of engineers and partners to provide solutions to process customers 

oems represent another area of addressed market expansion and a strong growth opportunity to remain competitive oems need to find the optimal balance of machine cost and performance while reducing their time to market our scalable integrated architecture and intelligent motor control offerings along with design productivity tools and our motion and safety products can assist oems in addressing these business needs 

we have developed a powerful network of channel partners technology partners and commercial partners that act as amplifiers to our internal capabilities and enable us to serve our customers’ needs around the world 

broad range of industries served 

we apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products resourcebased and transportation 

our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage home and personal care and life sciences industries these customers’ needs include new capacity incremental capacity from existing facilities an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors 

we serve customers in resourcebased industries including oil and gas mining aggregates cement metals energy pulp and paper and waterwastewater companies in these industries typically invest when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is increasing 

in the transportation industry factors such as geographic expansion investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers’ automation investment decisions our sales in transportation are primarily to automotive and tire manufacturers 

outsourcing and sustainability trends 

demand for our products solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally 

we help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency environmental and safety goals higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to invest in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor control and energy efficient solutions and services in addition environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices 

acquisitions 

our acquisition strategy focuses on products solutions or services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings in october 2012 we acquired certain assets of the medium voltage drives business of harbin jiuzhou electric co ltd a leading manufacturer of medium voltage drives direct current power supplies switch gear and wind inverters headquartered in harbin china the acquisition strengthened our presence in the asiapacific motor control market by adding significant capabilities in design engineering and manufacturing of medium voltage drive products in march 2012 we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of softswitching technologies corporation an industrial power quality detection and protection systems provider in the united states in may 2011 we purchased a majority stake in the equity of lektronix limited and its affiliate an independent industrial automation repair and service provider primarily in europe and asia in april 2011 we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of hiprom pty ltd and its affiliates a process control and automation systems integrator for the mining and mineral processing industry in south africa 

we believe the acquired companies will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers 

continuous improvement 

productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity we are in the process of developing and implementing common global processes and an enterprisewide business system these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2012  sales to us customers accounted for 49 percent  of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets include 

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2010  to 2012  which point to moderating growth in manufacturing activity during fiscal 2012 these indicators are among the factors that lead us to anticipate a period of slower industrial growth we continue to believe this is a pause in the recovery and not an inflection point we expect to see improved market conditions in fiscal 2013 but not until the latter part of the year 



note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus regional trends 

in 2012  sales to nonus customers accounted for 51 percent  of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets 

we use changes in gross domestic product gdp as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business in 2012 worldwide gdp growth has slowed and in some regions gdp has declined indicating a global economic slowdown in europe sovereign debt concerns have put downward pressure on industrial growth western europe continues to operate in a recessionary environment with potential for an improved outlook in some economies later next year the emerging markets in europe the middle east and africa emea experienced strong growth that is expected to continue next year in asia china experienced its slowest gdp growth since early 2009 but the economy shows some signs of improvement india was flat in 2012 compared to 2011 and there is no indication of any near term improvement in latin america mexico was the strongest performing country with projected continued growth brazil experienced an economic slowdown in 2012 but the outlook is for some improvement in 2013 we still expect that emerging markets will be the fastest growing automation markets over the long term 

summary of results of operations 

despite a difficult economic environment in 2012  we delivered sales growth of 4 percent  or 6 percent  organically and ended the year with record sales of 62594 million  all regions experienced organic sales growth year over year led by canada with organic sales growth of 20 percent emea had strong organic growth of 6 percent in the face of a recession in western europe the end markets with the strongest sales growth for the year were transportation and oil and gas

introduction of new nongaap measures and changes to definition of segment operating earnings for fiscal 2013 

in order to provide transparency into the operational results of our business beginning in fiscal 2013 we will provide nongaap earnings measures adjusted income and adjusted eps that exclude nonoperating pension costs and their related tax effects from income from continuing operations we define nonoperating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements these components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operational performance of our business in addition we will redefine segment operating earnings to exclude nonoperating pension costs service cost and amortization of prior service cost will continue to be included in our segment operating earnings as these components of net periodic benefit cost represent the operating cost of providing pension benefits to our employees 

adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share eps 

adjusted eps and adjusted income are nongaap measures that exclude the effects of the nonoperating pension costs and their related tax effects we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period our measures of adjusted income and adjusted eps may be different from measures used by other companies these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations and diluted eps 



operating and nonoperating pension costs 



segment operating earnings nongaap 

the table below reflects our operating results for years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 with nonoperating pension costs reclassified to their own line item for all periods presented these costs were previously included in the operating earnings of each segment and in general corporatenet fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 nonoperating pension costs excluded from architecture  software segment operating earnings were 116 million 113 million and 34 million respectively fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 nonoperating pension costs excluded from control products  solutions segment operating earnings were 209 million 99 million and 62 million respectively fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 nonoperating pension costs excluded from general corporatenet were 27 million 23 million and 05 million respectively 



1 total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are nongaap financial measures we believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance we use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies 

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 



our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thus does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows our accounting for sharebased compensation requires us to report the related excess income tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

free cash flow was a source of 5976 million  for the year ended september 30 2012  compared to a source of 5617 million  for the year ended september 30 2011  free cash flow for 2012 and 2011 include discretionary pretax contributions to our us qualified pension trust of 300 million and 150 million respectively the increase in free cash flow is primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and a smaller increase in working capital partially offset by a higher discretionary pretax contribution to our us qualified pension trust in 2012 

we purchased 4875 million  of shortterm investments in the year ended september 30 2012  of which 1375 million  matured during the same period 

we repurchased approximately 37 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2012  the total cost of these shares was 2653 million  of which 76 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2012  related to 110000  shares that did not settle until october 2012  in 2011  we repurchased approximately 40 million  shares of our common stock the total cost of these shares was 2992 million  of which 17 million  was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2011  related to 30000  shares that did not settle until october 2011  our decision to repurchase stock in 2013  will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price at september 30 2012  we had approximately 9367 million  remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our retirement plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2013  to be about 150 million we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm investments cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

given our extensive international operations a significant amount of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds are held in nonus subsidiaries where our undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested generally these funds would be subject to us tax if repatriated the percentage of such nonus funds can vary from quarter to quarter with a range of approximately 70 percent to 90 percent over the past eight quarters as of september 30 2012  approximately 90 percent of our funds were held in such nonus subsidiaries we have not encountered and do not expect to encounter any difficulty meeting the liquidity requirements of our domestic and international operations 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2012  commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 1570 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 027 percent  we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended september 30 2011  our debttototalcapital ratio was 364 percent  at september 30 2012  and 341 percent  at september 30 2011  

at september 30 2012  and 2011  our total current borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in march 2015 was 7500 million we have not borrowed against this credit facility at september 30 2012  or 2011  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of this credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent we were in compliance with all covenants under this credit facility at september 30 2012  and 2011  separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1206 million  at september 30 2012  were available to nonus subsidiaries 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the shortterm credit ratings set forth in the table below under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2012  



our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

we enter into contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 2474 million  in 2012   1745  per common share 2110 million  in 2011   1475  per common share and 1736 million  in 2010   122  per common share our current quarterly dividend rate is 047  per common share  188  per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to organic sales in millions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2012  was 1047 million  compared to 914 million  in 2011  approximately 72 percent of our 2012  global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2012  us pension expense included the following discount rate of 520 percent  compared to 560 percent  for 2011  expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent  compared to 800 percent  for 2011  and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 400 percent  compared to 400 percent  for 2011  

in 2012  2011  and 2010  we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our us pension plans however we made voluntary contributions of 3000 million  1500 million  and 1500 million  to our us pension plans in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately  1688 million  in 2013  an increase  of approximately 641 million  from 2012  of which 206 million and 435 million relate to operating and nonoperating pension costs respectively further information on operating and nonoperating pension costs is provided in introduction of new nongaap measures and changes to definition of segment operating earnings for fiscal 2013 section in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis 

 for 2013  our us discount rate will decrease to 415 percent  the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans we have assumed a us longterm compensation increase rate of 400 percent  in 2013  we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain at 800 percent  in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plans’ invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the target allocations and ranges of expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 



the financial markets produced strong results in 2012  the plan’s debt securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2012  as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values the plan’s equity securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2012  largely due to higher us equity returns while the financial markets continue to experience volatility we have not changed our expectation for longterm returns for the asset categories in which our plan assets are invested actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets was approximately 660 percent  annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2012  and was approximately 900 percent  annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2012  

the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation 

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and annual net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 



more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 80 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered within this category we will at times enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products andor the performance of services such as installation and commissioning the timing of delivery though varied based upon the nature of the undelivered component is generally shortterm in nature for these arrangements revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on that elements relative selling price provided the delivered element has value to customers on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from thirdparty evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items if such evidence is not available we use our best estimate of the selling price which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 107 million  

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of offset exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1766 million  at september 30 2012  and 1620 million  at september 30 2011  of which 79 million  at september 30 2012  and 80 million  at september 30 2011  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our accrual for environmental matters was 452 million  net of related receivables of 321 million  at september 30 2012  and 411 million  net of related receivables of 325 million  at september 30 2011  our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 223 million  at september 30 2012  and 201 million  at september 30 2011  

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion 

we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 34 million  in other current liabilities and 224 million  in other liabilities at september 30 2012  and 47 million  in other current liabilities and 239 million  in other liabilities at september 30 2011  

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 135 million  of which 16 million  has been accrued in other current liabilities at september 30 2012 and 2011 and 88 million  and 101 million  has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2012  and 2011  respectively a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and nonus jurisdictions additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 703 million  at september 30 2012  and 751 million  at september 30 2011  the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was 233 million  at september 30 2012  and 302 million  at september 30 2011  we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense total accrued interest and penalties were 201 million  at september 30 2012  and 169 million  at september 30 2011  we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced  by up to 12 million  during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations 

we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss tax credit and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 318 million  at september 30 2012  and 328 million  at september 30 2011  based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected 

our consolidated financial statements provide for tax liability on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries that will be repatriated to the us as of september 30 2012 we have not provided us deferred taxes for 20810 million of such earnings since these earnings have been and under current plans will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the us 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 124 million  and a liability of 230 million  at september 30 2012  we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in 2012  the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while in 2011  the relative weakening of the us dollar had a favorable impact while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar further strengthens relative to 2012  levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 10 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2012  and 2011  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2012  were 1570 million  with remaining maturities of 6 days  at a weighted average interest rate of 027 percent  we had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings at september 30 2011 as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2012 a 100 basis point increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by 27 million due to the low level of variablerate borrowings in 2011 interest rate changes would not have had a material impact on interest expense 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with a carrying value of 9050 million  at september 30 2012  and 2011  the fair value of this debt was 11879 million  at september 30 2012  and 11254 million  at september 30 2011  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

 item 1a   risk factors 

tableend 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our revenues and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows credit markets tighten or sovereign debt concerns linger companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

approximately 51 percent of our revenues in 2011 were outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on growth in our international sales numerous risks and uncertainties affect our international operations these risks and uncertainties include increased financial legal and operating risks such as political and economic instability compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification labeling and customer requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions 

  7 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline 

failures or security breaches of our products or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products solutions and services for customers and in our enterprise it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals and other attacks targeting every type of it system including industrial control systems such as those we sell and serve and corporate enterprise it systems 

our portfolio of hardware and software products solutions and services and our enterprise it systems may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs that access them these attacks have sometimes been successful 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of software hardware or a system that we sold or serviced could result in the disruption of our customers’ business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our enterprise it system could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on revenue harm our reputation cause us to incur legal liability and cause us to incur increased costs to address such events and related security concerns 

we are implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that is resulting in redesigned processes organization structures and a common information system significant rollouts of the system occurred at our us locations and certain nonus locations in 2007 to 2011 and are scheduled to continue at additional locations in 2012 and beyond as we continue to implement new systems they may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are inherent risks in our solutions businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the quality of our subcontractors if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation product performance quality of our products and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion lower revenues and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims by taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel while appropriately managing costs related to employee benefits 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and heath care benefits 

the amount of expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans depends on factors such as changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets significant decreases in market interest rates or the value of plan assets would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits continue to increase as well 

increasing employee benefit costs or the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability safety and health employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our revenues 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our revenues a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

we rely on vendors to supply equipment and components which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our business requires that we buy equipment and components including finished products which may include computer chips and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers of these items involves certain risks including 

 

 

 

 

any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue to invest in initiatives to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets

mcgregor texas nwirp facility environmental claim ric operated the naval weapons industrial reserve plant nwirp in mcgregor texas from 1958 through 1978 for the united states navy incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the nwirp to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on december 3 2007 the united states department of justice doj notified ric that the united states navy was seeking to recover environmental cleanup costs incurred at the nwirp the doj asserted that it has incurred more than 50 million excluding interest attorneys’ fees and other indirect costs in environmental cleanup costs at the nwirp and it believes that it may have a potential cause of action against ric and other former contractors at the nwirp for recovery of those costs in june 2011 ric and one other former contractor at the nwirp reached a settlement with the doj and the united states navy to resolve all claims in exchange for payment of 14 million ric will be responsible for half of the settlement amount the parties negotiated the terms of a consent decree that was reviewed and approved by the doj the consent decree was submitted to the district court and once approved will completely resolve this claim 

asbestos we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against ric’s divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company nationwide and kemper insurance kemper the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims we believe this arrangement will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

our customers face the challenge of remaining globally cost competitive and automation can help them achieve their productivity and sustainability objectives in addition increasingly complex and volatile customer demand patterns drive the need for flexible manufacturing our value proposition is to help our customers reduce time to market lower total cost of ownership increase asset utilization and reduce business risks 

differentiation through technology and domain expertise 

we seek a technology leadership position in all facets of industrial automation we believe our core technologies are the foundation for longterm sustainable growth 

our integrated control and information architecture with logix at its core is capable of safely and efficiently controlling industrial processes while connecting the plant floor to the enterprise systems and the external supply chain this architecture is an important differentiator and the anchor of our comprehensive automation offering we complement the scalable logix platform with additional control solutions suited for less complex machine applications investments in these technologies have expanded our served market beyond discrete control into process safety and plantwide information 

we believe that process automation is the largest growth opportunity for our company our logix architecture enables us to compete effectively with traditional distributed control systems dcs providers for many process applications 

we have one of the most comprehensive safety offerings in the industry including both machine and process safety products and solutions we see significant potential in the growing safety market we successfully integrated safety into the logix platform with our launch of guardlogix ® safety controllers our safety products are designed to bring a dual benefit to our customers a safe environment for their employees and productivity in their operations 

through internal investment and acquisitions we have expanded our software and communication capabilities both of which are critical components of our integrated architecture and key to optimizing processes and assets while integrating the plant floor the enterprise business system and the supply chain 

our broad power and motor control offering is one of our core competencies many of our motor control products are intelligent and configurable and can be integrated seamlessly with the logix architecture these products enhance the availability efficiency and safe operation of our customers’ critical and most energyintensive plant assets 

we augment our product portfolio with solutions and service offerings we have expanded our portfolio of repeatable solutions which enables us to gain efficiency drive innovation and improve the global deployment of our solutions to our customers the combination of our leading technologies with the industryspecific domain expertise of our people enables us to solve many of our customers’ manufacturing challenges 

global expansion 

as the manufacturing world continues to expand we must be able to meet our customers’ needs in emerging markets we expect to continue to add solutions and services personnel and expand our sales force in emerging markets over the long term we currently have approximately 60 percent of our employees outside the us and 51 percent of our revenues outside of the us 

as we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of products solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions we have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing product development and customer facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world growth in the emerging markets of asiapacific including china and india latin america central and eastern europe and africa is projected to exceed global gross domestic product gdp growth rates due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing impact of consumer spending in these markets we believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future 

enhanced market access 

oems represent another growth opportunity the oem market is large and we have an opportunity to increase market share particularly outside of north america to remain competitive oems need to continually improve their costs and machine performance and reduce their time to market our modular and scalable logix offering particularly when combined with motion and safety can assist oems in addressing these business needs we also continue to expand our portfolio for less complex oem machines which helps to expand our addressed market especially in emerging economies

broad range of industries served 

we apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products resourcebased and transportation 

our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage home and personal care and life sciences industries these customers’ needs include new capacity incremental capacity from existing facilities an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors 

we serve customers in resourcebased industries including oil and gas mining aggregates cement metals pulp and paper and waterwastewater companies in these industries typically invest when commodity prices are relatively high and global demand for basic materials is increasing 

in the transportation industry factors such as geographic expansion investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies influence customers’ automation investment decisions our sales in transportation are primarily to automotive and tire manufacturers 

outsourcing and sustainability trends 

demand for our products solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally 

we help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency environmental and safety goals higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to invest in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor control and energy efficient solutions and services in addition environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices 

acquisitions 

our acquisition strategy focuses on products solutions or services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings in may 2011 we purchased a majority stake in the equity of lektronix limited and its affiliate lektronix an independent industrial automation repairs and service provider in europe and asia in april 2011 we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of hiprom pty ltd and its affiliates hiprom a process control and automation systems integrator for the mining and mineral processing industry in south africa in march 2009 we bought a majority of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the automation business of rutter hinz inc which expanded our business in canada and in the oil and gas and other resourcebased industries in january 2009 we bought the assets and assumed certain liabilities of xi’an hengsheng science  technology limited this acquisition advanced our globalization strategy and strengthened our ability to deliver project management and engineering solutions primarily to our customers in china 

we believe the acquired companies will help us expand our market share and deliver value to our customers 

continuous improvement 

productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity we are in the process of developing and implementing common global processes and an enterprisewide information system these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investment in growth and technology and to offset inflation our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

  18 

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2011 sales to us customers accounted for 49 percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets include 

 

 

 

 

the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2009 to 2011 industrial production and capacity utilization have continued to increase the pmi was lower than the preceding quarter but continued to indicate expansion of manufacturing activity these indicators are among the factors that lead us to be cautiously optimistic about a continued recovery with slower and potentially more uneven growth 

 

note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

  19 

nonus regional trends 

in 2011 sales to nonus customers accounted for 51 percent of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets 

we use changes in gdp as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business growth in emerging markets continues to exceed global gdp growth rates but has moderated during fiscal 2011 in europe sovereign debt concerns have put downward pressure on industrial growth while these trends indicate slower growth than recently experienced overall macroeconomic trends and forecasts make us cautiously optimistic that the global recovery will continue into fiscal 2012

summary of results of operations 

sales in fiscal 2011 increased 24 percent compared to 2010 we continued to execute our key initiatives well which contributed to our positive performance 

 

 

 

 

the improvement in operating margin was primarily due to volume leverage partially offset by sales mix and increased spending to support growth 

general corporate expenses were net of a 38 million gain in 2011 resulting from the sale of an investment

income from continuing operations before income taxes 

income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 58 percent from 4404 million in 2010 to 6971 million in 2011 the increase was predominantly due to increased volume partially offset by increased spending to support growth selling general and administrative expenses increased by 1379 million from 13233 to 14612 but decreased as a percentage of sales by 28 points to 244 percent as volume increases outpaced spending increases 

general corporate expenses were net of a 38 million gain in 2011 resulting from the sale of an investment 

 

   23 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2011 was 197 percent compared to 191 percent in 2010 the 2011 and 2010 effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent because our sales outside of the us benefited from lower tax rates 

during 2011 we recognized net discrete tax benefits of 250 million related to the favorable resolution of worldwide tax matters and the retroactive extension of the us federal research credit during 2010 we recognized discrete tax benefits of 272 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters partially offset by discrete tax expenses of 96 million primarily related to the impact of a change in mexican tax law and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2011 and 2010 affecting the respective tax rates 

discontinued operations

operating margin 

architecture  software segment operating earnings were 6591 million in 2011 up 39 percent from 4754 million in 2010 operating margin increased 29 points to 254 percent in 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase in operating margin was predominantly due to volume increases as a result of higher worldwide levels of industrial production and capital spending by our customers partially offset by sales mix and increased spending to support growth 

control products  solutions 

 

sales 

control products  solutions sales increased 24 percent to 34061 million in 2011 compared to 27420 million in 2010 organic sales increased 20 percent and the effects of currency translation and acquisitions contributed 3 percentage points and 1 percentage point respectively to the total increase the segment’s organic sales increase resulted from growth in both products and solutions and services businesses which grew at rates similar to the segment average latin america asiapacific and emea reported yearoveryear growth above the segment average while yearoveryear sales increases in the united states and canada were less than the segment average growth rate pricing had an immaterial effect on revenue during the period 

operating margin 

control products  solutions segment operating earnings were 3685 million in 2011 up 52 percent from 2418 million in the same period of 2010 operating margin increased 20 points to 108 percent in 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase was predominantly due to volume increases partially offset by sales mix and increased spending to support growth

2010 compared to 2009 

 

sales 

our sales increased 5245 million or 12 percent from 43325 million in 2009 to 48570 million in 2010 an organic sales increase of 10 percent was enhanced by benefits from currency translation of 2 percentage points we had positive performance in our product businesses across all regions resulting from the recovery in worldwide macroeconomic conditions and industrial production during 2010 pricing contributed less than 1 percentage point to growth during the period 

organic sales to customers in the asiapacific region increased 17 percent led by strength in the emerging markets including china and india organic sales increased 11 and 7 percent in the united states and canada respectively organic sales increased in latin america by 11 percent as recent growth offset declines earlier in the fiscal year organic sales increased 2 percent in emea as declines in our solutions and services businesses that have been slower to recover offset growth in our product businesses 

sales growth in our solutions and services business lagged the recovery in product sales in the first half of 2010 solutions and services sales declined year over year as a consequence of declining order rates in the second half of fiscal 2009 order rates began to improve in the first half of fiscal 2010 resulting in yearoveryear growth in solutions and services sales in the second half of 2010 for the full year sales in our solutions and services business declined 4 percent 

during 2010 sales in all of our end markets improved as the year progressed for fullyear 2010 the largest sales increases were to customers in the transportation industry 

income from continuing operations before income taxes 

income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 102 percent from 2179 million in 2009 to 4404 million in 2010 our strong performance reflects a continuing economic recovery gross profit margin increased by 37 points to 399 percent in 2010 increased volume restructuring savings and favorable mix contributed to the significant yearoveryear margin improvement partially offset by cost increases related to employee compensation pension and postretirement expense and incremental spending to support growth 

we saved approximately 120 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 related to benefits realized from restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2009 which was in line with our expectations we recorded 60 million less of restructuring charges during 2010 compared to 2009 which also contributed to the yearoveryear income improvement these benefits were offset by increases of approximately 200 million for employee compensation a 41 million increase in pension and postretirement expense and 50 million incremental spending to support growth in 2010 compared to 2009 

our architecture  software segment contributed 44 percent of our total sales in 2010 compared to 40 percent in 2009 during 2010 the architecture  software segment’s operating margin was 225 percent the increase in percentage of sales by our highermargin architecture  software segment caused a positive mix effect on operating margin 

general corporate expenses were 936 million in 2010 compared to 803 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher employee costs resulting from wage and salary increases as well as performancebased compensation selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 09 points to 272 percent as volume increases outpaced spending increases

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2010 was 191 percent compared to 204 percent in 2009 the 2010 and 2009 effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower nonus tax rates 

the 2010 rate was lower than 2009 because we benefited from a higher proportionate share of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions as compared to 2009 we also recognized discrete tax benefits of 272 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters partially offset by discrete tax expenses of 96 million primarily related to the impact of a change in mexican tax law and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2010 during 2009 we also recognized discrete tax benefits of 205 million related to the retroactive extension of the us federal research tax credit the resolution of a contractual tax obligation and various state tax matters partially offset by discrete tax expenses of 42 million related to a nonus subsidiary 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2010 and 2009 affecting the respective tax rates 

discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations increased 211 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 213 million tax benefit resulting from the resolution of a domestic tax matter relating to the january 2007 sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and repair services businesses

architecture  software 

 

sales 

architecture  software sales increased 23 percent to 21150 million in 2010 compared to 17235 million in 2009 organic sales increased 20 percent and the effects of currency translation contributed 3 percentage points to the total increase substantially all of the organic sales increase was the result of an increase in volume due to improving macroeconomic conditions in most regions and industries pricing had only a minor impact on revenue during the period canada and latin america yearoveryear sales increases were greater than the segment average rate of increase while yearoveryear sales increases to customers in the united states and asiapacific were consistent with the segment average rate of increase yearoveryear sales increases to customers in emea were slightly below the segment average rate of increase logix sales increased 25 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 

operating margin 

architecture  software segment operating earnings were 4754 million in 2010 up 113 percent from 2230 million in 2009 operating margin increased 96 points to 225 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase was predominantly due to volume increases as a result of higher worldwide levels of industrial production and capital spending by our customers approximately half of the restructuring cost savings additional employee compensation additional pension and postretirement expenses and incremental spending to support growth described above applied to the architecture  software segment 

control products  solutions 

 

sales 

control products  solutions sales increased 5 percent to 27420 million in 2010 compared to 26090 million in 2009 organic sales increased 2 percent and the effects of currency translation and acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points and 1 percentage point respectively the segment’s modest organic sales growth was primarily attributable to robust growth in the products businesses in 2010 offset by declines in solutions and services sales reflecting the decline in order rates that we experienced in the second half of 2009 while the decline in order rates led to significant sales declines in the first half of 2010 order rates recovered and after the normal lag associated with our solution and services sales we began to see revenue increases in these businesses in the second half of 2010 asiapacific and canada both reported doubledigit yearoveryear overall segment growth benefiting 27 million and 122 million respectively from recent acquisitions emea reported yearoveryear overall segment sales declines during 2010 while sales in the united states and latin america increased consistent with the segment average the impact of pricing on the segment’s sales increase was insignificant 

operating margin 

control products  solutions segment operating earnings were 2418 million in 2010 up 17 percent from 2067 million in the same period of 2009 operating margin increased 09 points to 88 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009 approximately half of the restructuring cost savings additional employee compensation additional pension and postretirement expenses and incremental spending to support growth described above applied to the control products  solutions segment positive mix attributable to the shift toward product sales from solutions and services sales contributed to the margin improvement

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 

 

our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thus does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows our accounting for sharebased compensation requires us to report the related excess income tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

free cash flow was a source of 5617 million for the year ended september 30 2011 compared to a source of 4107 million for the year ended september 30 2010 free cash flow for both 2011 and 2010 include discretionary pretax contributions of 150 million to the company’s us pension trust the increase in free cash flow is primarily due to improvements in current year earnings partially offset by higher compensation payments in 2011 compared to 2010 incentive compensation payments were lower than normal in 2010 as difficult economic conditions resulted in reduced or zero earned incentives for 2009 in most of our employee incentive compensation plans incentive compensation payments generally occur in the first quarter of the year following the year in which the incentive is earned we paid substantially all of the incentive compensation earned for 2010 performance in the first quarter of 2011 and will pay substantially all of the incentive compensation earned for 2011 in the first quarter of 2012 

commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2011 and 2010 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and had no borrowings outstanding during either year 

on october 11 2011 we contributed 300 million to our us qualified pension trust the contribution was funded with a combination of cash on hand and 275 million of commercial paper borrowings 

  29 

we repurchased approximately 40 million shares of our common stock in 2011 the total cost of these shares was 2992 million of which 17 million was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2011 related to 30000 shares that did not settle until october 2011 in 2010 we repurchased approximately 22 million shares of our common stock the total cost of these shares was 1200 million of which 12 million was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2010 related to 19700 shares that did not settle until october 2010 our decision to repurchase stock in 2012 will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price at september 30 2011 we had approximately 2020 million remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our pension plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be about 140 million we expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototalcapital ratio was 341 percent at september 30 2011 and 383 percent at september 30 2010 this decrease is primarily due to the net increase in shareowners’ equity 

on march 14 2011 we replaced our former threeyear 2675 million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2012 and our former 364day 3000 million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march 2011 with a new fouryear 7500 million unsecured revolving credit facility we did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of our former credit facilities we have not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at september 30 2011 or 2010 borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent we were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at september 30 2011 and 2010 separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1278 million at september 30 2011 were available to nonus subsidiaries 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2011 

 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the commercial paper ratings set forth in the table above under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings are affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

  30 

we enter into contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 2110 million in 2011 1475 per common share cash dividends to shareowners were 1736 million in 2010 122 per common share cash dividends to shareowners were 1645 million in 2009 116 per common share our current quarterly dividend rate is 0425 per common share 170 per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2011 are in millions 

 

 

supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits — pension 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2011 was 914 million compared to 750 million in 2010 approximately 77 percent of our 2011 global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2011 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 560 percent compared to 620 percent for 2010 expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent compared to 800 percent for 2010 and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 400 percent compared to 430 percent for 2010 

we changed our measurement date in 2009 from june 30 to september 30 as required by us gaap we recorded a reduction in retained earnings of 82 million 53 million net of tax in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change 

the pension protection act of 2006 was signed into law in august 2006 the internal revenue service irs issued final guidance with respect to certain aspects of this law and our 2011 pension plan valuation has been completed based on the final guidance based on this valuation no minimum contributions were required in 2011 

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately 1039 million in 2012 an increase of approximately 125 million from 2011 for 2012 our us discount rate will decrease to 520 percent the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans we have assumed a us longterm compensation increase rate of 400 percent in 2012 we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain at 800 percent in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plans’ invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the target allocations and ranges of expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 

 

the financial markets were mixed in 2011 the plan’s debt securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2011 as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values the plan’s equity securities return trailed the expected return range in 2011 largely due to lower us equity returns and negative international equity returns while the financial markets continue to experience volatility we have not changed our expectation for longterm returns for the asset categories in which our plan assets are invested actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets has approximated 750 percent annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2011 and has exceeded 850 percent annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2011 

  33 

the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and annual net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 

 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements

revenue recognition 

for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered although the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions our control product  solutions business also sells certain products solutions and services that require separate delivery we divide these arrangements into separate deliverables and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the relative selling price of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 85 million 

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of offset exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1620 million at september 30 2011 and 1359 million at september 30 2010 of which 80 million at september 30 2011 and 164 million at september 30 2010 was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

  35 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our reserve for environmental matters was 411 million net of related receivables of 325 million at september 30 2011 and 371 million net of related receivables of 250 million at september 30 2010 our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 201 million at september 30 2011 and 176 million at september 30 2010 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion 

we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 47 million in other current liabilities and 239 million in other liabilities at september 30 2011 and 79 million in other current liabilities and 227 million in other liabilities at september 30 2010 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 162 million of which 16 million and 64 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and 101 million and 111 million has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and foreign jurisdictions additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 751 million at september 30 2011 and 663 million at september 30 2010 the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was 302 million at september 30 2011 and 95 million at september 30 2010 we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense total accrued interest and penalties were 169 million at september 30 2011 and 266 million at september 30 2010 we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to 54 million during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations 

we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss tax credit and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 328 million at september 30 2011 and 267 million at september 30 2010 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 296 million and a liability of 77 million at september 30 2011 we enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to us dollars in 2011 and 2010 the relative weakening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to 2011 levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 15 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2011 and 2010 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

  38 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings we had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings at september 30 2011 and 2010 in october 2011 we borrowed 275 million in commercial paper in order to partially fund a 300 million discretionary contribution to our us qualified pension trust due to the low level of variablerate borrowings in 2011 and 2010 interest rate changes would not have had a material impact on interest expense 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 9050 million at september 30 2011 and 9049 million at september 30 2011 the fair value of this debt was 11254 million at september 30 2011 and 10738 million at september 30 2010 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2011 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as previously disclosed we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprisewide information technology system in the fourth quarter of 2011 we deployed new business processes and functionality of the system related to our engineering manufacturing order management and finance functions to certain locations in doing so we modified and enhanced our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f as a result of and in connection with the implementation of the new system and processes additional implementations will occur to most locations of our company over a multiyear period with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 20122014 

there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended september 30 2011 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process uses the integrated risk framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso to assess manage and monitor risks we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoiding risks we can mitigate these risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

approximately 49 percent of our revenues in 2010 were outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on growth in our international sales numerous risks and uncertainties affect our international operations as international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks these risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability compliance with existing and future laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates while these factors and their impacts are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business for example we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material product certification labeling and customer requirements these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to ship our products into certain jurisdictions we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our business and operating results would be adversely affected 

  7 

adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our revenues and profitability 

we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur we may experience reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows or credit markets tighten companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

information technology infrastructure failures could disrupt our business 

we depend heavily on our information technology it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives if we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure a problem with the functioning of an important it application a breach of security or an intentional disruption of our it systems the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 

we are implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that is resulting in redesigned new processes organization structures and a common information system significant rollouts of the system occurred at our us locations and certain locations in mexico and europe in 2007 to 2010 and are scheduled to continue at additional locations in 2011 and beyond as we continue to implement new systems they may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are inherent risks in our solutions businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the quality of our subcontractors if we are unable to control manage and mitigate these risks our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on breadth and scope of our product portfolio and solution and service offerings technology differentiation product performance quality of our products and services knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing delivery and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion lower revenues and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our revenues 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent of our sales are through distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to our existing distribution channel could adversely affect our revenues a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

  8 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims and environmental remediation could reduce our profitability 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability safety and health employment contract matters and environmental remediation 

we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities which could result in product liability claims being brought against us the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

our operations are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costly 

in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

we rely on vendors to supply equipment and components which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our manufacturing processes require that we buy equipment and components which may include computer chips and commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers of these items involves certain risks including 

 

 

 

 

any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where substitute sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 

  9 

we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims by taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue to invest in initiatives to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts and the actions taken by governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create political or economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel while appropriately managing costs related to employee benefits 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and heath care benefits 

the amount of expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans depends on factors such as changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets significant decreases in market interest rates or the value of plan assets would increase our expenses expenses related to employerfunded health care benefits continue to increase as well 

increasing employee benefit costs or the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets

 item 2 properties 

at september 30 2010 we operated 52 plants manufacturing space occupied approximately 43 million square feet of which 48 percent was in the united states and canada our architecture  software segment occupied approximately 12 million square feet our control products  solutions segment occupied approximately 14 million square feet and the remaining approximately 17 million square feet of manufacturing space was shared by our operating segments we also had 250 sales and administrative offices and a total of 27 warehouses service centers and other facilities the aggregate floor space of our facilities was approximately 103 million square feet of this floor space we owned approximately 21 percent and leased approximately 79 percent at september 30 2010 approximately 10 million square feet of floor space was not in use mostly in owned facilities 

there are no major encumbrances other than financing arrangements which in the aggregate are not significant on any of our plants or equipment in our opinion our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

rocky flats plant  ric operated the rocky flats plant the plant golden colorado from 1975 through december 1989 for the department of energy doe incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the plant to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on may 4 2005 ric filed a claim with the doe seeking recovery of 113 million in unreimbursed costs incurred in defense of a qui tam suit against ric related to rocky flats on september 30 2005 the doe contracting officer denied that claim and demanded repayment of 4 million in previously reimbursed defense costs on november 10 2005 ric appealed both aspects of the contracting officer’s decision regarding defense costs to the civilian board of contract appeals board on july 9 2007 the board ruled that ric was not entitled to be reimbursed for costs incurred by it in defense of the qui tam action and that the doe was entitled to be repaid the previously reimbursed costs as a result of further proceedings on december 17 2008 the board held allowable those costs incurred by ric in defense of claims other than the claims on which it was found liable in the qui tam case appeals from that ruling were dismissed and the matter is once again before the board for further proceedings the actual amounts that ric may be required to repay to the doe and that the doe must reimburse ric will be determined in further proceedings this matter has been resolved except for a dispute between ric and the doe related to reimbursement and indemnification of attorney’s fees and costs which if disposed of unfavorably to us would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

mcgregor texas nwirp facility environmental claim ric operated the naval weapons industrial reserve plant nwirp in mcgregor texas from 1958 through 1978 for the united states navy incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the nwirp to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on december 3 2007 the united states department of justice doj notified ric that the united states navy was seeking to recover environmental cleanup costs incurred at the nwirp the doj now asserts that it has incurred more than 50 million excluding interest attorneys fees and other indirect costs in environmental cleanup costs at the nwirp and it believes that it may have a potential cause of action against ric and other former contractors at the nwirp for recovery of those costs along with the initial notification the doj also proposed a tolling agreement so that the parties could discuss settlement ric and several other former contractors have entered into the tolling agreement with the doj to date no lawsuit has been filed moreover we believe that ric has several meritorious defenses to the doj’s claim at this time ric has indicated that it cannot estimate its potential exposure in this matter if any but it intends to continue discussion with the doj 

  11 

asbestos we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against ric’s divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company and kemper insurance the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide administers the kemper buyout funds and has entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims once the kemper buyout funds are depleted we believe that these arrangements will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

foreign corrupt practices act  as a result of an internal review we determined during the fourth quarter of 2006 that actions by a small number of employees at certain of our operations in one jurisdiction may have violated the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or other applicable laws we and some of our distributors do business in this jurisdiction with government owned enterprises or government owned enterprises that are evolving to commercial businesses these actions involved payments for nonbusiness travel expenses and certain other business arrangements involving potentially improper payment mechanisms for legitimate business expenses special outside counsel was engaged to investigate the actions and report to the audit committee 

we voluntarily disclosed these actions to the doj and the sec beginning in september 2006 we have implemented thorough remedial measures during 2010 the doj declined to pursue charges against us however we remain in negotiations with the sec over possible civil claims against us 

if violations of the fcpa occurred we may be subject to consequences that could include disgorgement civil penalties other costs and businessrelated impacts we could also face similar consequences from local authorities we do not believe the consequences of this investigation the remediation or any related penalties or business related impacts will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2010 sales to us customers accounted for 51 percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets include 

 

 

 

 

the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2008 to 2010 the early part of the industrial recovery has been stronger than we expected however high unemployment and relatively low levels of capacity utilization continue to create uncertainty as to the pace of the recovery 

 

note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

  19 

nonus regional trends 

in 2010 sales to nonus customers accounted for 49 percent of our total sales these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence in addition to the global factors previously mentioned international demand particularly in emerging markets has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets 

we use changes in gdp as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business gdp either declined or grew slowly in all regions during fiscal 2009 contributing to reduced customer demand signs indicating economic growth in most regions began to appear in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 and continued into fiscal 2010 gdp growth in asiapacific particularly the emerging countries including china and india continued to exceed the global average while growth in the european region continues to be below average gdp growth in latin america accelerated during 2010 continued improvement in the global economy seems to indicate that the recovery is taking hold

summary of results of operations 

sales in 2010 increased 12 percent compared to 2009 as an organic sales increase of 10 percent was enhanced by benefits from currency translation of 2 percentage points product sales grew 22 percent year over year reflecting improved maintenance repair  operations mro smaller capital projects and oem demand sales growth in our solutions and services business lagged the recovery in product sales in the first half of 2010 solutions and services sales declined year over year as a consequence of declining order rates in the second half of fiscal 2009 order rates began to improve in the first half of fiscal 2010 resulting in yearoveryear growth in solutions and services sales in the second half of 2010 for the full year sales in our solutions and services business declined 4 percent 

asiapacific was our best performing region as organic sales increased 17 percent compared to 2009 latin america and the united states also performed well as organic sales increased 11 percent in both regions year over year total sales in emerging markets increased 18 percent with an organic sales increase of 14 percent plus 4 percentage points from currency translation and acquisitions emerging markets now represent over 20 percent of total company sales 

as a consequence of the rapid and large declines in sales in fiscal 2009 due to the severe global recession we took aggressive actions to adjust our cost structure including restructuring actions that were implemented throughout 2009 temporary employee pay and benefit reductions and general reductions in discretionary spending during 2010 these actions contributed approximately 120 million of benefit to our current year results consistent with our expectations 

our favorable results and improved outlook for the full year caused us to reverse our temporary employee pay cuts and restore the 401k company match effective january 1 2010 we also implemented wage and salary increases for employees as a result employee costs which also include performancebased compensation and sales incentives increased by approximately 200 million and pension and postretirement expense increased by 41 million in 2010 compared to 2009 in addition we spent approximately 50 million more related to customerfacing resources particularly in emerging markets and innovation in our products services and solutions offerings in 2010

2010 compared to 2009 

 

sales 

our sales increased 5245 million or 12 percent from 43325 million in 2009 to 48570 million in 2010 an organic sales increase of 10 percent was enhanced by benefits from currency translation of 2 percentage points we had positive performance in our product businesses across all regions resulting from the recovery in worldwide macroeconomic conditions and industrial production during 2010 pricing contributed less than 1 percentage point to growth during the period 

organic sales to customers in the asiapacific region increased 17 percent led by strength in the emerging markets including china and india organic sales increased 11 and 7 percent in the united states and canada respectively organic sales increased in latin america by 11 percent as recent growth offset declines earlier in the fiscal year organic sales increased 2 percent in emea as declines in our solutions and services businesses that have been slower to recover offset growth in our product businesses 

sales growth in our solutions and services business lagged the recovery in product sales in the first half of 2010 solutions and services sales declined year over year as a consequence of declining order rates in the second half of fiscal 2009 order rates began to improve in the first half of fiscal 2010 resulting in yearoveryear growth in solutions and services sales in the second half of 2010 for the full year sales in our solutions and services business declined 4 percent 

during 2010 sales in all of our end markets improved as the year progressed for fullyear 2010 the largest sales increases were to customers in the transportation industry 

income from continuing operations before income taxes 

income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 102 percent from 2179 million in 2009 to 4404 million in 2010 our strong performance reflects a continuing economic recovery gross profit margin increased by 37 points to 399 percent in 2010 increased volume restructuring savings and favorable mix contributed to the significant yearoveryear margin improvement partially offset by cost increases related to employee compensation pension and postretirement expense and incremental spending to support growth 

we saved approximately 120 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 related to benefits realized from restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2009 which was in line with our expectations we recorded 60 million less of restructuring charges during 2010 compared to 2009 which also contributed to the yearoveryear income improvement these benefits were offset by increases of approximately 200 million for employee compensation a 41 million increase in pension and postretirement expense and 50 million incremental spending to support growth in 2010 compared to 2009 

our architecture  software segment contributed 44 percent of our total sales in 2010 compared to 40 percent in 2009 during 2010 the architecture  software segment’s operating margin was 225 percent the increase in percentage of sales by our highermargin architecture  software segment caused a positive mix effect on operating margin 

general corporate expenses were 936 million in 2010 compared to 803 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher employee costs resulting from wage and salary increases as well as performancebased compensation selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 09 points to 272 percent as volume increases outpaced spending increases 

  23 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2010 was 191 percent compared to 204 percent in 2009 the 2010 and 2009 effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower nonus tax rates 

the 2010 rate was lower than 2009 because we benefited from a higher proportionate share of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions as compared to 2009 we also recognized discrete tax benefits of 272 million primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax matters partially offset by discrete tax expenses of 96 million primarily related to the impact of a change in mexican tax law and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2010 during 2009 we also recognized discrete tax benefits of 205 million related to the retroactive extension of the us federal research tax credit the resolution of a contractual tax obligation and various state tax matters partially offset by discrete tax expenses of 42 million related to a nonus subsidiary 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2010 and 2009 affecting the respective tax rates 

discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations increased 211 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 213 million tax benefit resulting from the resolution of a domestic tax matter relating to the january 2007 sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and repair services businesses

architecture  software 

 

sales 

architecture  software sales increased 23 percent to 21150 million in 2010 compared to 17235 million in 2009 organic sales increased 20 percent and the effects of currency translation contributed 3 percentage points to the total increase substantially all of the organic sales increase was the result of an increase in volume due to improving macroeconomic conditions in most regions and industries pricing had only a minor impact on revenue during the period canada and latin america yearoveryear sales increases were greater than the segment average rate of increase while yearoveryear sales increases to customers in the united states and asiapacific were consistent with the segment average rate of increase yearoveryear sales increases to customers in emea were slightly below the segment average rate of increase logix sales increased 25 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 

operating margin 

architecture  software segment operating earnings were 4754 million in 2010 up 113 percent from 2230 million in 2009 operating margin increased 96 points to 225 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase was predominantly due to volume increases as a result of higher worldwide levels of industrial production and capital spending by our customers approximately half of the restructuring cost savings additional employee compensation additional pension and postretirement expenses and incremental spending to support growth described above applied to the architecture  software segment 

control products  solutions 

 

sales 

control products  solutions sales increased 5 percent to 27420 million in 2010 compared to 26090 million in 2009 organic sales increased 2 percent and the effects of currency translation and acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points and 1 percentage point respectively the segment’s modest organic sales growth was primarily attributable to robust growth in the products businesses in 2010 offset by declines in solutions and services sales reflecting the decline in order rates that we experienced in the second half of 2009 while the decline in order rates led to significant sales declines in the first half of 2010 order rates recovered and after the normal lag associated with our solution and services sales we began to see revenue increases in these businesses in the second half of 2010 asiapacific and canada both reported doubledigit yearoveryear overall segment growth benefiting 27 million and 122 million respectively from recent acquisitions emea reported yearoveryear overall segment sales declines during 2010 while sales in the united states and latin america increased consistent with the segment average the impact of pricing on the segment’s sales increase was insignificant 

operating margin 

control products  solutions segment operating earnings were 2418 million in 2010 up 17 percent from 2067 million in the same period of 2009 operating margin increased 09 points to 88 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009 approximately half of the restructuring cost savings additional employee compensation additional pension and postretirement expenses and incremental spending to support growth described above applied to the control products  solutions segment positive mix attributable to the shift toward product sales from solutions and services sales contributed to the margin improvement 

  25 

2009 compared to 2008 

 

sales 

sales decreased 24 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the effects of currency translation contributed 5 percentage points to the decrease we experienced a significant decline in customer demand during 2009 due to deteriorating economic financial and credit market conditions in most regions and industries sales to customers in the united states declined 22 percent organically as compared to 2008 as plant shutdowns occurred and production slowed across many industries the canadian organic sales decline of 28 percent compared to 2008 was driven by weakness in all industrial sectors including transportation and general manufacturing sales to customers in emea declined 19 percent organically compared to 2008 emea weakness occurred in all industries as well as in sales to oems due to a large number of plant shutdowns and production cutbacks organic sales in asiapacific declined by 11 percent compared to 2008 korea and japan contributed most to the decline in the region organic sales in latin america declined by 6 percent as compared to 2008 the latin america region benefited from demand in resourcebased industries during the first two quarters of the year but experienced yearoveryear organic sales declines in the second half of the year 

in 2009 we experienced significant yearoveryear declines in all of our end markets including transportation metals and to a lesser extent consumer products industries however the decline in process sales was lower than our average rate of decline 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was 186 million in 2009 compared to 242 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to completed amortization of certain intangible assets and currency translation 

general corporate — net 

general corporate expenses were 803 million in 2009 compared to 772 million in 2008 the increase was primarily due to increased charitable contributions and a gain recognized in the first nine months of 2008 in connection with the divestiture of power systems partially offset by cost reductions 

interest expense 

interest expense was 609 million in 2009 compared to 682 million in 2008 the decrease was due to lower interest rates and lower shortterm debt balances 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2009 was 204 percent compared to 286 percent in 2008 the 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower tax rates on income outside the united states and in 2008 we benefited from the use of foreign tax credits 

the 2009 rate was lower than 2008 because we benefited from a lower proportionate share of income in higher tax rate jurisdictions as compared to 2008 during 2009 we also recognized discrete tax benefits of 205 million related to the retroactive extension of the us federal research tax credit the resolution of a contractual tax obligation and various state tax matters partially offset by discrete tax expenses of 42 million related to a nonus subsidiary 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2009 and 2008 affecting the respective tax rates 

  26 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations decreased 62 percent in 2009 to 2179 million compared to 2008 the decrease is primarily due to our significant decline in sales volume inflation the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease these items were partially offset by cost reductions lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate 

during 2009 we recorded restructuring charges of 604 million 418 million after tax or 029 per diluted share related to actions designed to better align our cost structure with current economic conditions we recorded 352 million of the restructuring charges as a reduction of architecture  software operating earnings and 252 million as a reduction of control products  solutions operating earnings special items of 40 million in 2009 include the reversal of a portion of restructuring accruals established in prior years 

during 2008 we recorded restructuring charges of 507 million 340 million after tax or 023 per diluted share related to actions designed to better align resources with growth opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions this charge was partially offset by the reversal of 40 million 36 million net of tax or 002 per diluted share of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions as employee attrition differed from our original estimates we recorded these net charges in special items in 2008 

see note 14 in the financial statements for more information on restructuring charges and special items 

architecture  software 

 

sales 

architecture  software sales decreased 29 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 as plant shutdowns occurred and production slowed across many industries organic sales decreased 24 percent as the effects of currency translation contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the decline we experienced yearoveryear declines in sales of this segment as a result of the global recession and the shortcycle nature of this segment’s sales activities logix sales declined 17 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 while the decline in sales of our legacy processor products was greater than the segment’s average rate of decline 

operating margin 

architecture  software segment operating margin decreased by 113 points to 129 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to significant declines in sales volume the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease partially offset by cost reductions 

  27 

control products  solutions 

 

sales 

control products  solutions sales decreased 20 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 organic sales decreased 15 percent as the effects of currency translation contributed 5 percentage points to the decrease we experienced significant yearoveryear declines in sales by the products businesses of this segment as a result of the global recession and the shortcycle nature of these businesses’ sales activities sales by our solutions and services businesses declined at a lower rate than the segment’s average rate of decline as we delivered solutions from our backlog 

operating margin 

control products  solutions segment operating margin decreased by 55 points to 79 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease resulted primarily from significant declines in sales volume inflation the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease which was partially offset by cost reductions

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 

 

the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions 

 

our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy our accounting for sharebased compensation requires us to report the related excess income tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects us federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds these taxes paid in 2008 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses 

free cash flow was a source of 4107 million for the year ended september 30 2010 compared to a source of 4308 million for the year ended september 30 2009 this decrease in free cash flow is primarily due to a discretionary pretax contribution of 150 million to our us pension trust and increased working capital partially offset by improvements in current year earnings and reduced incentive compensation payments the working capital increase was largely attributable to significant increases in inventory and accounts receivable and was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable levels these changes restored working capital to levels reflective of current demand the reduced incentive compensation payments were a function of timing and varying levels of earned incentives in 2009 compared to 2008 incentive compensation payments generally occur in the first quarter of the year following the year in which the incentive is earned incentive compensation payments were lower than normal in 2010 as difficult economic conditions resulted in reduced or zero earned incentives for 2009 in most of our employee incentive compensation plans we will pay substantially all of the incentive compensation earned for 2010 performance in the first quarter of 2011 

in december 2007 we issued an aggregate of 500 million principal amount of our 565 notes due 2017 and 625 debentures due 2037 the debt offering yielded approximately 4935 million of proceeds which were used to repay at maturity our 615 notes due january 15 2008 and for general corporate purposes 

commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2010 and 2009 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during 2010 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

  29 

we repurchased approximately 22 million shares of our common stock in 2010 the total cost of these shares was 1200 million of which 12 million was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2010 related to 19700 shares that did not settle until october 2010 in 2009 we repurchased approximately 17 million shares of our common stock all of which occurred in october 2008 the total cost of these shares was 500 million our decision to repurchase stock in 2011 will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price at september 30 2010 we had approximately 5012 million remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements capital expenditures additional contributions to our pension plans acquisitions of businesses dividends to shareowners repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2011 to be about 120 million we expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototalcapital ratio was 383 percent at september 30 2010 and 407 percent at september 30 2009 this decrease is primarily due to the net increase in shareowners’ equity 

on march 16 2009 we replaced our former fiveyear 6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility with two new unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling 5350 million each with an individual borrowing limit of 2675 million one facility has a threeyear term and the other facility had a 364day term on march 15 2010 we replaced our former 364day 2675 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a new 364day 3000 million unsecured revolving credit facility increasing our current borrowing capacity under the two facilities to 5675 million the new credit facility includes a termout option that allows us to borrow on march 14 2011 up to 3000 million as a term loan for one year we have not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at september 30 2010 or 2009 borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent we were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at september 30 2010 and 2009 separate shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1353 million at september 30 2010 were available to nonus subsidiaries 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2010 

 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the commercial paper ratings set forth in the table above under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facilities if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings are affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

  30 

we enter into contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 1736 million in 2010 122 per common share cash dividends to shareowners were 1645 million in 2009 and 1702 million in 2008 116 per common share each year our current quarterly dividend rate is 035 per common share 140 per common share annually which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2010 are in millions

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits 

pension benefits 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2010 was 750 million compared to 327 million in 2009 approximately 67 percent of our 2010 global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2010 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 620 percent compared to 675 percent for 2009 expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent compared to 800 percent for 2009 and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 430 percent compared to 420 percent for 2009 

we changed our measurement date in 2009 from june 30 to september 30 as required by us gaap we recorded a reduction in retained earnings of 82 million 53 million net of tax in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change 

the pension protection act of 2006 was signed into law in august 2006 the internal revenue service irs issued final guidance with respect to certain aspects of this law and our 2010 pension plan valuation has been completed based on the final guidance based on this valuation no minimum contributions were required in 2010 

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately 909 million in 2011 an increase of approximately 159 million from 2010 for 2011 our us discount rate will decrease to 560 percent the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans we have assumed a us longterm compensation increase rate of 400 percent in 2011 we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pensioneligible earnings our expected rate of return on us plan assets will remain at 800 percent in estimating the expected return on plan assets we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term adjusted for forwardlooking considerations such as inflation interest rates equity performance and the active management of the plans’ invested assets we also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption the target allocations and ranges of expected return for our major categories of us plan assets are as follows 

 

the financial markets rallied significantly in 2010 recovering some of the losses incurred during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 the plan’s equity securities return exceeded the expected return range in 2010 largely due to strong us equity returns the plan’s debt securities return also exceeded the expected return range in 2010 as lower market interest rates resulted in higher bond values while the financial markets continue to experience volatility we have not changed our expectation for longterm returns for the asset categories in which our plan assets are invested actual return for our portfolio of us plan assets has approximated 800 percent annualized for the 15 years ended september 30 2010 and has exceeded 900 percent annualized for the 20 years ended september 30 2010 

  33 

the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the change in our compensation increase rate has a direct relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and annual net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 

 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

other postretirement benefits 

we estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions including the discount rate and for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program expected trends in the cost for healthcare services changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods the discount rate used to calculate our 2010 other postretirement benefits expense was 600 percent compared to 650 percent in 2009 for 2011 the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to 510 percent the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

effective october 1 2002 we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services as a result of this amendment our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare costs resulting from inflationary trends since january 1 2005 

we changed our measurement date in 2009 from june 30 to september 30 as required by us gaap we recorded a reduction in retained earnings of 40 million 25 million net of tax in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change 

net periodic benefit cost in 2010 was 141 million compared to 158 million in 2009 we estimate net periodic benefit cost will be approximately 95 million in 2011

revenue recognition 

for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii unitsofdelivery under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 79 million 

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of offset exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1359 million at september 30 2010 and 1161 million at september 30 2009 of which 164 million at september 30 2010 and 88 million at september 30 2009 was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

  35 

reserves for litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our reserve for environmental matters was 371 million net of related receivables of 250 million at september 30 2010 and 334 million net of related receivables of 248 million at september 30 2009 our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 176 million at september 30 2010 and 168 million at september 30 2009 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion 

we accrue for costs related to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 79 million in other current liabilities and 227 million in other liabilities at september 30 2010 and 29 million in other current liabilities and 239 million in other liabilities at september 30 2009 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor electric company for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure is capped at the amount received for the sale we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 206 million of which 64 million and 111 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and 111 million and 113 million has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and foreign jurisdictions additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures we recognized a 67 million decrease in shareowners’ equity as of october 1 2008 related to a change in accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with changes in us gaap the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 663 million at september 30 2010 and 1167 million at september 30 2009 the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was 95 million at september 30 2010 and 409 million at september 30 2009 in addition the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would be reported in discontinued operations if recognized was 57 million at september 30 2010 and 267 million at september 30 2009 we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense total accrued interest and penalties were 266 million at september 30 2010 and 276 million at september 30 2009 we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to 297 million during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations 

we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss tax credit and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 267 million at september 30 2010 and 438 million at september 30 2009 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforwards and certain temporary differences will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards or certain temporary differences than currently expected 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 282 million and a liability of 204 million at september 30 2010 we enter into these contracts with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to us dollars in 2010 the relative weakening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while in 2009 the relative strengthening of the us dollar had an unfavorable impact while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to 2010 levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 15 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2010 and 2009 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

  38 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings we had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings at september 30 2010 and 2009 the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper borrowings was 06 percent during 2009 due to the low level of variablerate borrowings in 2010 and 2009 interest rate changes would not have had a material impact on interest expense 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 9049 million at september 30 2010 and 9047 million at september 30 2009 the fair value of this debt was 10738 million at september 30 2010 and 9920 million at september 30 2009 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based upon that evaluation management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2010 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2010 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as previously disclosed we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprisewide information technology system in the fourth quarter of 2010 we deployed new business processes and functionality of the system related to our engineering manufacturing order management and finance functions to certain locations in doing so we modified and enhanced our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f as a result of and in connection with the implementation of the new system and processes additional implementations will occur to most locations of our company over a multiyear period with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 20112014 

there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended september 30 2010 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a   risk factors 

tableend 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows many of our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we can mitigate these risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant risks our erm process is a company wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and giving risks appropriate consideration we use the integrated risk framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso to assess manage and monitor risks 

a council of senior executives prioritizes identified risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to mitigate risks where possible our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews identified risks deemed most significant the audit committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and seek to control them 

our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value however these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries 

approximately 49 percent of our revenues in 2009 were outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on growth in our nonus sales numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability changes in laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights international transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs including risks of noncompliance with us and local laws affecting our activities abroad in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates while these factors and their impacts are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 

  6 

a global recession adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in additional decreases in our revenues and profitability 

recent global economic events including the tightening of credit markets and the failures or material deteriorations of financial institutions and other entities have resulted in a global recession if these conditions continue or worsen we could experience additional declines in revenues profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global or regional industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve as economic activity slows or credit markets tighten companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products 

our ability to access the credit markets and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions if our access to credit including the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced 

information technology infrastructure failures could disrupt our business 

we depend heavily on our information technology it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives if we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure a problem with the functioning of an important it application a breach of security or an intentional disruption of our it systems the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 

we are implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that will redesign and deploy new processes organization structures and a common information system over a period of several years significant rollouts of the system occurred at our us locations and certain locations in mexico and europe in 2007 to 2009 and are scheduled to continue at additional locations in 2010 and beyond as we implement the erp system the new system may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are inherent risks in our growing solutions businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors if we are unable to control manage and mitigate these risks our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects we compete based on product performance quality integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges pricing and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or to provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion and lower revenues and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

  7 

a disruption to our distribution channel could reduce our revenues 

in the united states and canada approximately 90 percent of our sales is through a limited number of distributors in certain other countries the majority of our sales is also through a limited number of distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our revenues a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of a distributor or other events 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims could increase our costs 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability safety and health employment and contract matters we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses in connection with these divestitures certain lawsuits claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law in some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities however it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so 

intellectual property infringement claims could harm our business and our customers 

others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we regularly provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the loss of patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant 

we rely on vendors to supply raw materials including commodities which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our manufacturing processes require that we buy a high volume of equipment components and raw materials including commodities such as copper aluminum and steel our reliance on suppliers of these raw materials involves certain risks including 

 

 

 

 

any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where alternative sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 

  8 

potential liabilities and costs for environmental remediation could reduce our profits 

our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims by taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be closer to our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue with our initiative to invest in actions to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts and the actions taken by governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create political or economic instability although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets

 item 2 properties 

at september 30 2009 we operated 55 plants manufacturing space occupied approximately 48 million square feet of which 52 percent was in the united states and canada our architecture  software segment occupied approximately 07 million square feet our control products  solutions segment occupied approximately 29 million square feet and the remaining approximately 12 million square feet of manufacturing space was shared by our operating segments we also had 269 sales and administrative offices and a total of 28 warehouses service centers and other facilities the aggregate floor space of our facilities was approximately 106 million square feet of this floor space we owned approximately 22 percent and leased approximately 78 percent at september 30 2009 approximately 266000 square feet of floor space was not in use mostly in owned facilities 

there are no major encumbrances other than financing arrangements which in the aggregate are not significant on any of our plants or equipment in our opinion our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

rocky flats plant  ric operated the rocky flats plant the plant golden colorado from 1975 through december 1989 for the department of energy doe incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the plant to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on january 30 1990 a class action was filed in the united states district court for the district of colorado against ric and another former operator of the plant the action alleges the improper production handling and disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances constituting among other things violations of various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto on october 8 1993 the court certified separate medical monitoring and property value classes effective august 1 1996 the doe assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants including ric in the action and has either reimbursed or paid directly the costs of ric’s defense on february 14 2006 a jury empanelled to try certain of the class action plaintiffs’ property damage claims found the contractor defendants liable for trespass and nuisance and awarded 176 million in compensatory damages and 200 million in punitive damages against the two defendants the jury also found ric to be 10 responsible for the trespass and 70 responsible for the nuisance on june 2 2008 the district court entered judgment against ric in the amount of 598 million including prejudgment interest ric has appealed the judgment at the direction of the doe execution of the judgment is currently stayed by letter dated june 5 2008 the doe confirmed its obligation to indemnify ric for any judgment or settlement arising out of this action and attorney’s fees and other costs associated with this action and acknowledged that the ultimate financial responsibility for this action lies with the us government accordingly we do not believe that the action will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

on may 4 2005 ric filed a claim with the doe seeking recovery of 113 million in unreimbursed costs incurred in defense of a qui tam suit against ric related to rocky flats on september 30 2005 the doe contracting officer denied that claim and demanded repayment of 4 million in previously reimbursed defense costs on november 10 2005 ric appealed both aspects of the contracting officer’s decision regarding defense costs to the civilian board of contract appeals board on july 9 2007 the board ruled that ric was not entitled to be reimbursed for costs incurred by it in defense of the qui tam action and that the doe was entitled to be repaid the previously reimbursed costs as a result of further proceedings on december 17 2008 the board held allowable those costs incurred by ric in defense of claims other than the claims on which it was found liable in the qui tam case the actual amounts that ric may be required to repay to the doe and that the doe must reimburse ric will be determined in further proceedings the doe has appealed the board’s previous ruling in that proceeding and ric has crossappealed

mcgregor texas nwirp facility environmental claim ric operated the naval weapons industrial reserve plant nwirp in mcgregor texas from 1958 through 1978 for the united states navy incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the nwirp to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on december 3 2007 the united states department of justice doj notified ric that the united states navy was seeking to recover environmental cleanup costs incurred at the nwirp the doj now asserts that it has incurred more than 50 million excluding interest attorneys fees and other indirect costs in environmental cleanup costs at the nwirp and it believes that it may have a potential cause of action against ric and other former contractors at the nwirp for recovery of those costs along with the initial notification the doj also proposed a tolling agreement so that the parties could discuss settlement ric and several other former contractors have entered into the tolling agreement with the doj to date no lawsuit has been filed and only one settlement discussion has taken place moreover we believe that ric has several meritorious defenses to the doj’s claim at this time ric has indicated that it cannot estimate its potential exposure in this matter if any but it intends to continue discussion with the doj 

asbestos we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against ric’s divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company and kemper insurance the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide administers the kemper buyout funds and has entered into a cost share agreement with us to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims once the kemper buyout funds are depleted we believe that these arrangements will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  11 

foreign corrupt practices act  as a result of an internal review we determined during the fourth quarter of 2006 that actions by a small number of employees at certain of our operations in one jurisdiction may have violated the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or other applicable laws we and some of our distributors do business in this jurisdiction with government owned enterprises or government owned enterprises that are evolving to commercial businesses these actions involved payments for nonbusiness travel expenses and certain other business arrangements involving potentially improper payment mechanisms for legitimate business expenses special outside counsel has been engaged to investigate the actions and report to the audit committee their review is ongoing 

we voluntarily disclosed these actions to the doj and the sec beginning in september 2006 we have implemented thorough remedial measures and are cooperating on these issues with the doj and sec we have agreed to update the doj and sec periodically regarding any further developments as the investigation continues 

if violations of the fcpa occurred we may be subject to consequences that could include fines penalties other costs and businessrelated impacts we could also face similar consequences from local authorities we do not believe the consequences of this investigation the remediation or any related penalties or business related impacts will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2009 sales to us customers accounted for 51 percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our us served markets include 

 

 

 

 

the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2007 to 2009 recent trends in most metrics show signs of possible stabilization however we continue to operate in a period of uncertainty with respect to the us economy 

 

 

  19 

nonus regional trends 

in 2009 sales to nonus customers accounted for 49 percent of our total sales outside the us demand for our products and services is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers’ ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets these customers include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and indigenous companies demand has historically been driven in part by 

 

we use changes in gdp as one indicator of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business gdp either declined or grew slowly in all regions during fiscal 2009 contributing to reduced customer demand we have observed the most significant effects of the gdp deceleration in the developed economies of canada western europe and asia pacific all of which experienced yearoveryear gdp declines we also saw gdp declines in latin america beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 gdp growth rates in certain asia pacific emerging economies exceeded the global average as growth in these economies began to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2009 signs indicating potential stabilization in global economic conditions began to appear in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 but the market outlook in all regions continues to remain uncertain

summary of results of operations 

our 2009 results reflect the severity of the global economic recession market conditions quickly deteriorated across most industries and all regions turmoil in the financial markets intensified the economic decline and was a contributing factor in most industrial companies’ decisions to slow production reduce spending and conserve cash all of these factors contributed to 2009 being one of the most challenging years in our history 

in this economic environment we experienced a full year organic revenue decline of 19 percent however we saw demand levels in our products business start to stabilize in the latter part of the year and our revenue grew sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2009 while macroeconomic conditions appear to be stabilizing the outlook for manufacturing investment remains uncertain

during 2009 we acted decisively throughout the year to rightsize our cost structure allowing us to achieve cost savings in 2009 and expected incremental cost savings in 2010 these actions required us to record restructuring charges of 604 million 418 million after tax or 029 per diluted share we carefully balanced these actions with preserving investments in our core technologies and global domain expertise we also generated significant cash flow this year by quickly aligning inventory levels to lower demand effectively managing receivables in a difficult credit environment and appropriately constraining capital spending our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong 

we will continue our operating discipline with a focus on cost control and cash management into 2010 we believe our ongoing commitment to innovation technology differentiation domain expertise and thought leadership will enable us to continue to meet our customers’ global productivity and sustainability needs 

the following tables reflect our sales and operating results for the years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions except per share amounts

sales decreased 24 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the effects of currency translation contributed 5 percentage points to the decrease we experienced a significant decline in customer demand during 2009 due to deteriorating economic financial and credit market conditions in most regions and industries sales to customers in the united states declined 22 percent organically as compared to 2008 as plant shutdowns occurred and production slowed across many industries the canadian organic sales decline of 28 percent compared to 2008 was driven by weakness in all industrial sectors including transportation and general manufacturing sales to customers in emea declined 19 percent organically compared to 2008 emea weakness occurred in all industries as well as in sales to oems due to a large number of plant shutdowns and production cutbacks organic sales in asiapacific declined by 11 percent compared to 2008 korea and japan contributed most to the decline in the region organic sales in latin america declined by 6 percent as compared to 2008 the latin america region benefited from demand in resourcebased industries during the first two quarters of the year but experienced yearoveryear organic sales declines in the second half of the year 

in 2009 we experienced significant yearoveryear declines in all of our end markets including transportation metals and to a lesser extent consumer products industries however the decline in process sales was lower than our average rate of decline 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was 186 million in 2009 compared to 242 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to completed amortization of certain intangible assets and currency translation 

general corporate — net 

general corporate expenses were 803 million in 2009 compared to 772 million in 2008 the increase was primarily due to increased charitable contributions and a gain recognized in the first nine months of 2008 in connection with the divestiture of power systems partially offset by cost reductions 

interest expense 

interest expense was 609 million in 2009 compared to 682 million in 2008 the decrease was due to lower interest rates and lower shortterm debt balances 

  22 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2009 was 204 percent compared to 286 percent in 2008 the 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower tax rates on income outside the united states and in 2008 we benefited from the use of foreign tax credits 

the 2009 rate was lower than 2008 because we benefited from a lower proportionate share of income in higher tax rate jurisdictions as compared to 2008 during 2009 we also recognized discrete tax benefits of 205 million related to the retroactive extension of the us federal research tax credit the resolution of a contractual tax obligation and various state tax matters partially offset by discrete tax expenses of 42 million related to a nonus subsidiary 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2009 and 2008 affecting the respective tax rates 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations decreased 62 percent in 2009 to 2179 million compared to 2008 the decrease is primarily due to our significant decline in sales volume inflation the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease these items were partially offset by cost reductions lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate 

during 2009 we recorded restructuring charges of 604 million 418 million after tax or 029 per diluted share related to actions designed to better align our cost structure with current economic conditions we recorded 352 million of the restructuring charges as a reduction of architecture  software operating earnings and 252 million as a reduction of control products  solutions operating earnings special items of 40 million in 2009 include the reversal of a portion of restructuring accruals established in prior years 

during 2008 we recorded restructuring charges of 507 million 340 million after tax or 023 per diluted share related to actions designed to better align resources with growth opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions this charge was partially offset by the reversal of 40 million 36 million net of tax or 002 per diluted share of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions as employee attrition differed from our original estimates we recorded these net charges in special items in 2008 

see note 14 in the financial statements for more information on restructuring charges and special items 

architecture  software 

 

sales 

architecture  software sales decreased 29 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 as plant shutdowns occurred and production slowed across many industries organic sales decreased 24 percent as the effects of currency translation contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the decline we experienced yearoveryear declines in sales of this segment as a result of the global recession and the shortcycle nature of this segment’s sales activities logix sales declined 17 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 while the decline in sales of our legacy processor products was greater than the segment’s average rate of decline 

operating margin 

architecture  software segment operating margin decreased by 113 points to 129 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to significant declines in sales volume the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease partially offset by cost reductions 

  23 

control products  solutions 

 

sales 

control products  solutions sales decreased 20 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 organic sales decreased 15 percent as the effects of currency translation contributed 5 percentage points to the decrease we experienced significant yearoveryear declines in sales by the products businesses of this segment as a result of the global recession and the shortcycle nature of these businesses’ sales activities sales by our solutions and services businesses declined at a lower rate than the segment’s average rate of decline as we delivered solutions from our backlog 

operating margin 

control products  solutions segment operating margin decreased by 55 points to 79 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease resulted primarily from significant declines in sales volume inflation the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and restructuring charges also contributed to the decrease which was partially offset by cost reductions 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

sales 

sales increased 14 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 organic sales increased 6 percent with effects of currency translation and acquisitions adding 5 and 3 percentage points to the growth rate respectively in 2008 we continued the execution of our ongoing globalization strategy and our focus on emerging markets as approximately 50 percent of our sales during 2008 were to nonus customers sales in emerging markets grew at above our average growth rate we demonstrated improved performance in the asiapacific region with particular strength in china and india the growth rate in asiapacific accelerated every quarter during 2008 resulting in a full year organic growth rate of 15 percent compared to 2007 we continued to see strong organic growth in latin america of 14 percent benefiting from strength in resourcebased industries sales to customers in the united states canada and emea each grew at 45 percent organically 

in 2008 we experienced considerable growth in our key process and oem growth initiatives demonstrating the ongoing diversification of our revenue base we achieved above average growth in resourcebased industries primarily due to higher commodity prices infrastructure spending and continued demand for oil gas and other resources particularly in emerging markets sales to global automotive customers grew at about our average growth rate but us automotive growth was below our average growth rate sales to customers in the life sciences industries were significantly below our average growth rate our sales growth in the food and beverage and home and personal care industries was also below our average growth rate however these industries tend to provide for more consistent rates of growth over time 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was 242 million in 2008 compared to 164 million in 2007 the increase was due to amortization of intangibles from recent acquisitions particularly cedes incuity pavilion and industrial control services group limited which does business as ics triplex 

  24 

general corporate — net 

general corporate expenses were 772 million in 2008 compared to 728 million in 2007 the increase was primarily due to lower interest and dividend income in 2008 compared to 2007 partially offset by reduced charitable contributions in 2008 and lower environmental remediation charges at legacy sites compared to 2007 

interest expense 

interest expense was 682 million in 2008 compared to 634 million in 2007 the increase was due to higher average outstanding borrowings partially offset by lower interest rates than the prior year 

special items 

in 2008 we incurred special charges of 507 million 340 million after tax or 023 per diluted share related to restructuring actions designed to better align resources with growth opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions this charge was partially offset by the reversal of 40 million 36 million net of tax or 002 per diluted share of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions as employee attrition differed from our original estimates the 2008 restructuring actions include workforce reductions aimed at streamlining administrative functions realigning selling resources to the highest anticipated growth opportunities and consolidating business units 

special items of 435 million in 2007 include costs related to various restructuring actions designed to execute on our cost productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy actions included workforce reductions realignment of administrative functions and rationalization and consolidation of global operations 

see note 14 in the financial statements for more information on restructuring charges and special items 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2008 was 286 percent compared to 278 percent in 2007 the effective tax rate in 2008 was lower than the statutory tax rate of 35 percent because of lower tax rates on income outside the united states and because we used foreign tax credits the tax rate in 2008 was higher than 2007 because we favorably resolved various federal and state matters in the prior year 

the 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower nonus tax rates resolved certain tax matters and claims related to the closure of the 2005 us federal audit cycle and various state tax audits and made other provision adjustments 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2008 and 2007 affecting the respective tax rates 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations in 2008 increased 83 million compared to 2007 the increase was primarily due to productivity performance and higher volume partially offset by increased investment spending to support globalization growth and technology increased purchase accounting depreciation and amortization inflation and a higher effective income tax rate 

discontinued operations 

amounts reported for discontinued operations in 2007 primarily relate to the operating results of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment for periods before the divestiture and the gain on sale of the principal businesses of that operating segment net income on operating activities of power systems was 423 million in 2007 we reported an aftertax gain on the sale of power systems of 8682 million 539 per share in 2007 

we also reported aftertax income of 80 million during 2007 related to other discontinued operations activities see note 13 in the financial statements for more information on discontinued operations

architecture  software 

 

sales 

architecture  software sales increased 9 percent compared to 2007 organic growth accounted for 3 percentage points of the increase as foreign currency translation and acquisitions added 5 and 1 percentage points to the growth rate respectively logix sales grew 12 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 partially offset by a decline in our legacy processor sales 

operating margin 

segment operating margin decreased by 23 points in 2008 compared to 2007 and was negatively impacted by increased investment spending to support technology and growth yearoveryear impact of acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency partially offset by volume leverage and productivity 

control products  solutions 

 

sales 

control products  solutions sales increased 18 percent compared to 2007 organic sales growth was 9 percent as foreign currency translation and acquisitions added 5 and 4 percentage points to the growth rate respectively yearoveryear results benefited from our growth initiatives and strong results from our solutions businesses especially in resourcebased end markets 

operating margin 

segment operating margin decreased 09 points in 2008 compared to 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the mix between our product and solutions businesses the impact of foreign currency increased investment spending and the negative impact of acquisitions partially offset by strong productivity performance volume leverage and price

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 

 

our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy our accounting for sharebased compensation requires us to report the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects us federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds these taxes paid in 2008 and 2007 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses 

free cash flow was a source of 4308 million for the year ended september 30 2009 compared to a source of 4583 million for the year ended september 30 2008 this decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in current year earnings and an increase in payments related to restructuring actions partially offset by improvements in working capital resulting from our lower sales volume refunds related to a contractual tax matter and lower capital expenditures 

in december 2007 we issued an aggregate of 500 million principal amount of our 565 notes due 2017 and 625 debentures due 2037 the debt offering yielded approximately 4935 million of proceeds which were used to repay at maturity our 615 notes due january 15 2008 and for general corporate purposes 

in january 2007 we received 175 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we used the cash proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of the divestiture to pay taxes on the gain on sale and to acquire ics triplex 

commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2009 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2008 commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 1000 million with a weighted average interest rate of 22 percent 

  27 

in 2009 we repurchased approximately 17 million shares of our common stock all of which occurred in october 2008 the total cost of these shares was 500 million this is compared to purchases of approximately 67 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 3551 million in 2008 of these purchases 01 million shares amounting to 35 million did not settle until october 2008 and were recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2008 our decision to repurchase stock in 2010 will depend on business conditions free cash flow generation other cash requirements and stock price at september 30 2009 we had approximately 6212 million remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include dividends to shareowners capital expenditures additional contributions to our pension plans acquisitions of businesses repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt we expect capital expenditures in 2010 to be about 110 million we expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototalcapital ratio was 407 percent at september 30 2009 and 373 percent at september 30 2008 this increase is primarily due to a 3603 million reduction in shareowners’ equity net of tax related to the funded status of our pension plans which decreased as a result of lower discount rates and a decrease in our pension plan assets 

on march 16 2009 we replaced our former fiveyear 6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility with two new unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling 5350 million both new facilities have borrowing limits of 2675 million each one facility has a threeyear term and the other facility has a 364day term our 364day credit facility includes a termout option that allows us to borrow on march 15 2010 up to 2675 million as a term loan for one year we have not drawn down under any of these credit facilities at september 30 2009 or 2008 borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent we were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at september 30 2009 and 2008 in addition to our two 2675 million credit facilities shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1697 million at september 30 2009 were available to nonus subsidiaries 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2009 

 

among other uses we can draw on our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the commercial paper ratings set forth in the table above under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facilities if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

  28 

we enter into contracts to hedge certain thirdparty sales and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years and to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 1645 million in 2009 1702 million in 2008 and 1847 million in 2007 116 per share each year our current quarterly dividend rate is 029 per outstanding share which is determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

a summary of our projected contractual cash obligations at september 30 2009 are in millions 

 

 supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits 

pension benefits 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2009 was 327 million compared to 286 million in 2008 approximately 51 percent of our 2009 global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2009 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 675 percent compared to 650 percent for 2008 expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent compared to 800 percent for 2008 and an assumed longterm compensation increase rate of 420 percent compared to 415 percent for 2008 

we changed our measurement date in 2009 from june 30 to september 30 as required by us gaap we recorded a reduction in retained earnings of 82 million 53 million net of tax in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change 

the pension protection act of 2006 was signed into law in august 2006 the internal revenue service irs issued final guidance with respect to certain aspects of this law and our 2009 pension plan valuation has been completed based on the final guidance this valuation resulted in no minimum contributions being required in 2009 

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately 712 million in 2010 an increase of approximately 385 million from 2009 for 2010 our us discount rate will decrease to 620 percent the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans our assumed rate of return on us plan assets will remain at 800 percent we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption we have assumed a us longterm compensation increase rate of 430 percent in 2010 we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension eligible earnings 

the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumption for our us pension plans in millions 

 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

  31 

other postretirement benefits 

we estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions including the discount rate and for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program expected trends in the cost for healthcare services changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods the discount rate used to calculate our 2009 other postretirement benefits expense was 650 percent compared to 625 percent in 2008 for 2010 the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to 600 percent the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

effective october 1 2002 we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services as a result of this amendment our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare costs resulting from inflationary trends since january 1 2005 

we changed our measurement date in 2009 from june 30 to september 30 as required by us gaap we recorded a reduction in retained earnings of 40 million 25 million net of tax in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this change 

net periodic benefit cost in 2009 was 158 million compared to 154 million in 2008 we expect net periodic benefit cost in 2010 of approximately 140 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate 2158 million 

more information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 80 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii unitsofdelivery under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 61 million 

  32 

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of offset exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1161 million at september 30 2009 and 1378 million at september 30 2008 of which 88 million at september 30 2009 and 132 million at september 30 2008 was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

fair value measurements 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation expense net of the related income tax benefit amounted to 187 million in 2009 215 million in 2008 and 188 million in 2007 compensation costs are based on the grantdate fair value of the instruments using a valuation model and are recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term we estimate the average riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield expected volatility and expected term of the compensation instrument outstanding in order to determine fair value of stock options granted the valuation model is most sensitive to the expected volatility and term assumptions 

stock options granted during 2009 had a weighted average fair value of 775 per share the chart below illustrates the weighted average fair value assuming a 10 percent change in the expected volatility and term assumptions 

 

asset retirement obligations 

we accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 29 million in other current liabilities and 239 million in other liabilities at september 30 2009 and 51 million in other current liabilities and 228 million in other liabilities at september 30 2008 

indemnifications 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale we recorded a liability and a reduction to the gain on sale under relevant us gaap guarantor accounting rules related to these indemnification obligations a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 259 million of which 111 million and 105 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and 113 million and 129 million has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  33 

derivatives 

we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks we enter into these contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next two years cash flow hedges we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate as hedging instruments to offset transaction gains and losses associated with certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies the fair value of all derivative financial instruments is recorded in the balance sheet which is based on the quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities unrealized gains on derivative instruments are recorded in other current assets in the amounts of 250 million and 61 million and in other assets in the amounts of 114 million and 51 million at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively unrealized losses on derivative instruments are recorded in other current liabilities in the amounts of 191 million and 162 million and in other liabilities in the amounts of 94 million and 84 million at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 

purchase accounting goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 

when we acquire a business we account for the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value at the date of acquisition in order to value acquired identifiable intangible assets and determine their amortizable lives management must use judgment in selecting relevant assumptions see note 2 in the financial statements for a discussion of acquisitions in 2009 2008 and 2007 

in years subsequent to the year of acquisition we perform an annual impairment test on our goodwill balance we perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level we have determined that our reporting units are our two operating segments control products  solutions and architecture  software as we have concluded that components one level below these segments do not constitute reporting units 

we use a discounted cash flow valuation model to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the computed fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization to verify reasonableness the fair value of each reporting unit determined during the 2009 impairment test significantly exceeded the net asset book value of each reporting unit the valuation model is most sensitive to the discount rate perpetuity growth rate and tax rate assumptions a ten percent change in any one of these assumptions would not change the outcome of the goodwill impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit would continue to significantly exceed the net asset book value we have not changed our goodwill impairment testing valuation techniques during the current year 

we also perform an annual impairment test on our allenbradley ® and ics triplex tm trademarks as these trademarks have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization we use the relieffromroyalty method to determine the fair value of the trademarks which we compare to the book value to determine whether impairment is warranted inputs into the model requiring the most judgment are revenue growth and discount factor a ten percent change in either one of these assumptions would not result in impairment of either of our indefinite lived intangible assets 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

  34 

our reserve for environmental matters was 334 million net of related receivables of 248 million at september 30 2009 and 332 million net of related receivables of 228 million at september 30 2008 our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 168 million at september 30 2009 and 230 million at september 30 2008 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion 

more information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 17 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and foreign jurisdictions additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures we recognized a 67 million decrease in shareowners’ equity as of october 1 2008 related to a change in accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with changes in us gaap the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 1167 million at september 30 2009 and 1258 million at september 30 2008 the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was 409 million at september 30 2009 and 432 million at september 30 2008 in addition the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would be reported in discontinued operations if recognized was 267 million at september 30 2009 and 334 million at september 30 2008 we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense total accrued interest and penalties were 276 million at september 30 2009 and 260 million at september 30 2008 we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to 268 million during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations 

we recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 438 million at september 30 2009 and 451 million at september 30 2008 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforward amount will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards than currently expected 

  35 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their related tax effects we record the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of 364 million and a liability of 285 million at september 30 2009 we enter into these contracts with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to us dollars in 2009 the relative strengthening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while in 2008 the relative weakening of the us dollar had a favorable impact while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens relative to 2009 levels 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 15 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2009 and 2008 a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

  36 

the following table indicates the us dollar equivalent notional amounts by contractual maturity dates and related weighted average contract exchange rates for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at september 30 2009 in millions except for rates 

 

all of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future we designated certain of these contracts related to thirdparty sales or intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through june 2011 as cash flow hedges under us gaap the remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our consolidated balance sheet 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at september 30 2009 at september 30 2008 we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 1000 million with remaining maturities of six days at a weighted average interest rate of 22 percent the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper borrowings was 06 percent during 2009 and 29 percent during 2008 as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2009 and 2008 a 100 percent increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by 06 million and 79 million respectively we use a 100 percent hypothetical fluctuation as our actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2008 and 2009 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 9047 million at september 30 2009 and 9044 million at september 30 2008 the fair value of this debt was 9920 million at september 30 2009 and 8830 million at september 30 2008 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have evaluated the effectiveness as of september 30 2009 of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e of the exchange act based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2009 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based upon that evaluation management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2009 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2009 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as previously disclosed we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprisewide information technology system in the fourth quarter of 2009 we deployed new business processes and functionality of the system related to our engineering manufacturing order management and finance functions to certain locations in doing so we modified and enhanced our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f as a result of and in connection with the implementation of the new system and processes additional implementations will occur to most locations of our company over a multiyear period with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 20102013 

there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended september 30 2009 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 

approximately 50 percent of our revenues in 2008 were outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on continued growth in our nonus sales numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability changes in local governmental laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights international transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs including risks of noncompliance with us and local laws affecting our activities abroad in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates while these factors and their impacts are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

an inability to anticipate changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 

adverse changes in global or regional economic business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global or regional industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve including without limitation food and beverage home and 

  

personal care life sciences oil and gas mining aggregates cement metals waterwastewater forest products and transportation as economic activity slows or credit markets tighten companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending which could result in decreased demand for our products and negatively affect our business 

we intend to fund our future uses of cash which may include repayments of shortterm loans repurchases of common stock dividends to shareowners capital expenditures acquisitions of businesses and additional contributions to our pension plans with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or issuance of other securities our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise our cost of borrowings may increase and our operating results may be adversely affected 

a global recession and continued worldwide credit constraints could adversely affect us 

recent global economic events including concerns over the tightening of credit markets and failures or material business deterioration of financial institutions and other entities have resulted in a heightened concern regarding a potential global recession if these conditions continue or worsen we could experience potential declines in revenues profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders payment delays supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers prospective customers and suppliers 

information technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business 

we depend heavily on our information technology it infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives if we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure such as a computer virus a problem with the functioning of an important it application or an intentional disruption of our it systems the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 

we are implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that will redesign and deploy new processes organization structures and a common information system over a period of several years significant rollouts of the system occurred at several of our us locations and certain locations in mexico in 2007 and 2008 and are scheduled to continue at additional locations in 2009 and beyond as we implement the erp system the new system may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are inherent risks in our growing solutions businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors our inability to control manage and mitigate these risks could adversely affect our results of operations 

the global industrial automation power control and information products and services industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects including product performance quality developing integrated systems and applications that address the business challenges faced by our customers pricing and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion and lower revenues and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

  

a disruption to our distribution channel could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

in the united states and canada approximately 85 percent of our sales are through a limited number of third party distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a disruption could be caused by the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of the distributor or other events 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims could adversely affect our business 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability safety and health employment and contract matters we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

the inability to secure and maintain rights to intellectual property could harm our business and our customers 

we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the loss of patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant in addition others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we regularly provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely on third party suppliers for the purchase of raw materials including commodities which creates certain risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business 

our manufacturing processes require that we buy a high volume of equipment components and raw materials including commodities such as copper aluminum and steel from third party suppliers our reliance on these suppliers involves certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where alternative sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 

potential liabilities and costs for environmental remediation could adversely affect our business 

our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control 

  

of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility for the cleanup or other remediation of contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities related to our current and divested businesses to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses in prior years we retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds for periods before the divestitures as a result from time to time we may be required to make payments related to tax matters associated with those divested businesses 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing on our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be near our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue with our initiative to invest in actions to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts and the actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create political or economic instability any of which could have an adverse effect on our business although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products or disrupt our supply chain 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 

   

  

  

 future acquisitions could cause us to incur debt dilution contingent liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets

 item 2 properties 

at september 30 2008 we operated 59 plants manufacturing space occupied approximately 50 million square feet of which 54 percent was in north america our architecture  software segment occupied approximately 08 million square feet our control products  solutions segment occupied approximately 30 million square feet and the remaining approximately 12 million square feet of manufacturing space was shared by our operating segments we also had 282 sales and administrative offices and a total of 30 warehouses service centers and other facilities the aggregate floor space of our facilities was approximately 109 million square feet of this floor space we owned approximately 22 percent and leased approximately 78 percent at september 30 2008 approximately 205000 square feet of floor space was not in use mostly in owned facilities 

in november 2005 we sold and leased back 8 properties in north america comprising approximately 16 million square feet see note 17 in the financial statements for more information 

there are no major encumbrances other than financing arrangements which in the aggregate are not significant on any of our plants or equipment in our opinion our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 




 item 3 legal proceedings  

rocky flats plant  ric operated the rocky flats plant the plant golden colorado from 1975 through december 1989 for the department of energy doe incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the plant to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on january 30 1990 a class action was filed in the united states district court for the district of colorado against ric and another former operator of the plant the action alleges the improper production handling and disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances constituting among other things violations of various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto on october 8 1993 the court certified separate medical monitoring and property value classes effective august 1 1996 the doe assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants including ric in the action and has either reimbursed or paid directly the costs of ric’s defense on february 14 2006 a jury empanelled to try certain of the class action plaintiffs’ property damage claims found the contractor defendants liable for trespass and nuisance and awarded 176 million in compensatory damages and 200 million in punitive damages against the two defendants the jury also found ric to be 10 responsible for the trespass and 70 responsible for the nuisance on june 2 2008 the district court entered judgment against ric in the amount of 598 million including prejudgment interest ric has appealed the judgment at the direction of the doe execution of the judgment is currently stayed by letter dated june 5 2008 the doe confirmed its obligation to indemnify ric for any judgment or settlement arising out of this action and attorney’s fees and other costs associated with this action and acknowledged that the ultimate financial responsibility for this action lies with the us government accordingly we do not believe that the action will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

on november 13 1990 ric was served with another civil action brought against it in the same court by james stone claiming to act in the name of the united states alleging violations of the us false claims act in connection with its operation of the plant on april 1 1999 a jury awarded approximately 14 million in damages on may 18 1999 the court entered judgment against ric for approximately 42 million trebling the jury’s award as required by the false claims act and imposing a civil penalty of 15000 we have paid this judgment to the us government one claim remains pending in the stone action we intend to move to dismiss that claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction we believe that ric is entitled under applicable law and its contract with the doe to be indemnified for all costs and any liability associated with this action however as described below the civilian board of contract appeals has denied ric’s claim seeking reimbursement of certain of those costs 

on may 4 2005 ric filed a claim with the doe seeking recovery of 113 million in unreimbursed costs incurred in defense of the stone suit on september 30 2005 the doe contracting officer denied that claim and demanded repayment of 4 million in previously reimbursed stone defense costs on november 10 2005 ric appealed both aspects of the contracting officer’s decision regarding stone defense costs to the civilian board of contract appeals board on july 9 2007 the board ruled that the doe is entitled to be repaid the previously reimbursed stone defense costs and that ric cannot recover its unreimbursed costs to the extent that those costs were incurred defending the three false claims for which ric was found liable the board is currently considering ric’s motion to determine whether ric may recover or must repay to the doe costs incurred in defending the false claims and common law claims for which ric was not found liable if the board rules that ric must reimburse the doe the portion of the amount demanded by the doe 4 million plus interest will be determined in further proceedings 

mcgregor texas nwirp facility environmental claim ric operated the naval weapons industrial reserve plant nwirp in mcgregor texas from 1958 through 1978 for the united states navy incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the nwirp to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the us government 

on december 3 2007 the united states department of justice doj notified ric that the united states navy was seeking to recover environmental cleanup costs incurred at the nwirp the doj now asserts that it has incurred more than 50 million excluding interest attorneys fees and other indirect costs in environmental cleanup costs at the nwirp and it believes that it may have a potential cause of action against ric and other former contractors at the nwirp for recovery of those costs along with the initial notification the doj also proposed a tolling agreement so that the parties could discuss settlement ric and several other former contractors have entered into the tolling agreement with the doj to date no lawsuit has been filed and only one settlement discussion has taken place moreover we believe that ric has several meritorious defenses to the doj’s claim at this time ric has indicated that it cannot estimate its potential exposure in this matter if any but it intends to continue discussion with the doj 

asbestos we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies in some cases the claims involve products from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 we also are responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against ric’s divested measurement and flow control business but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

  

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for claims arising from our former allenbradley subsidiary following litigation against nationwide indemnity company and kemper insurance the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to allenbradley we entered into separate agreements on april 1 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of allenbradley asbestos claims in exchange for a lump sum payment kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to allenbradley nationwide will receive and administer the kemper buyout funds and has entered into a cost share agreement to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims once the kemper buyout funds are depleted we believe that these arrangements will continue to provide coverage for allenbradley asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of the asbestos liability 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

foreign corrupt practices act  as a result of an internal review we determined during the fourth quarter of 2006 that actions by a small number of employees at certain of our operations in one jurisdiction may have violated the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or other applicable laws we and some of our distributors do business in this jurisdiction with government owned enterprises or government owned enterprises that are evolving to commercial businesses these actions involved payments for nonbusiness travel expenses and certain other business arrangements involving potentially improper payment mechanisms for legitimate business expenses special outside counsel has been engaged to investigate the actions and report to the audit committee their review is ongoing 

we voluntarily disclosed these actions to the doj and the sec beginning in september 2006 we have implemented thorough remedial measures and are cooperating on these issues with the doj and sec we have agreed to update the doj and sec periodically regarding any further developments as the investigation continues 

if violations of the fcpa occurred we may be subject to consequences that could include fines penalties other costs and businessrelated impacts we could also face similar consequences from local authorities we do not believe the consequences of this investigation the remediation or any related penalties or business related impacts will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

we augment our product portfolio with solutions and service offerings to achieve greater customer intimacy the combination of our leading technologies such as integrated architecture with the industryspecific domain expertise of our people enables us to deliver effective solutions to our customers’ manufacturing challenges 

global expansion and enhanced market access 

as the manufacturing world continues to globalize we must be capable of meeting our customers’ needs in emerging markets we continue to add delivery resources and expand our sales force in emerging markets we currently have greater than 50 percent of our employees outside the us and achieved our goal of about 50 percent of our revenues outside of the us during 2008 

as we enter markets with considerable growth potential and expand our global footprint we will seek to continue to broaden the portfolio of products services and solutions that we provide to our customers in these regions we have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing and customer facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world the emerging markets of asia pacific including china and india latin america and eastern europe have the potential to grow at rates in excess of global gdp due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing role of consumer spending in these markets we believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will drive manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future 

original equipment manufacturers oems represent another growth opportunity for us the oem market is large and we have an opportunity to increase market share with oems particularly outside of north america to remain competitive oems need to continually improve their costs and machine performance and reduce their time to market our modular and scaleable logix offering combined with motion and safety can assist oems in addressing these business needs 

  

industry views 

we apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer resourcebased and transportation 

our consumer industry customers are engaged in the food and beverage home and personal care and life sciences industries these customers’ needs include global expansion incremental capacity from existing facilities an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance in addition these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors 

we serve customers in resourcebased industries including oil and gas mining aggregates cement metals waterwastewater and forest products higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic materials encourage companies in these industries to invest in capacity and productivity 

in transportation factors such as capacity utilization geographic expansion investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies are drivers of demand for our products services and solutions 

demand for our products services and solutions across all industries benefit from outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services in order to improve the flexibility of their cost base our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally the sustainability needs of our customers include energy efficiency and environmental and safety compliance higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to invest in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor controls and energy efficient solutions and services in addition environmental and safety regulations may cause customers to make investments to ensure compliance and implement acceptable business practices 

productivity 

productivity and continuous improvements are important components of our culture we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement functional streamlining material cost savings and manufacturing productivity we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprisewide information system these are designed to result in improved profitability that can be used to fund investment in growth and technology and to offset inflation and dilution from acquisitions our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost and improved asset utilization charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs 

acquisitions 

during 2008 we acquired cedes safety  automation ag cedes incuity software inc incuity and pavilion technologies inc pavilion we believe the acquired companies will help us expand our market share and deliver value to our customers 

with our acquisition of cedes we have expanded our comprehensive machine safety component portfolio for our customers worldwide cedes is a supplier of safety and measuring light curtains a leading product offering in the machine safety market 

our acquisition of incuity positions us for continued growth in the information solutions market incuity’s enterprise manufacturing intelligence offerings will enable us to accelerate specific aspects of our plantwide information strategy and extend the capabilities of our integrated architecture 

we believe that pavilion’s expertise in advanced process control production optimization and environmental compliance solutions paired with our logix architecture will help our customers create a more agile efficient and productive environment it will also benefit in particular our process growth initiative 

  

u s industrial economic trends 

in 2008 sales to us customers accounted for 50 percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

 

  

  

  

 the table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2006 to 2008 us industrial equipment spending declined slightly in 2008 yet remained at higher levels than 2006 and the first half of 2007 capacity utilization has moderated after reaching a peak in 2007 the pmi has remained below or near 50 during fiscal 2008 but declined significantly in september 2008 indicating expected weakness in the us manufacturing sector the industrial production index has gradually increased from 2006 through march of 2008 followed by a decline in the last two quarters we expect 2009 to be a challenging year based on the recent deterioration of these indices 

 

 note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

  

nonus regional trends 

in 2008 sales to nonus customers accounted for 50 percent of our total sales outside the us demand for our products and services is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers’ ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets these customers include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and indigenous companies recent strength in demand has in part been driven by investments in infrastructure in developing economies investments in basic materials production capacity in response to higher endproduct pricing and expanding consumer markets 

we use gdp growth rates as one indication of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business in the first half of fiscal 2008 gdp growth rates remained fairly robust in all regions especially in china india russia and brazil but have slowed recently consensus forecasts project lower gdp growth in all regions next year

summary of results of operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

2008 compared to 2007 

 

 sales 

sales increased 14 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 organic sales increased 6 percent with effects of currency translation and acquisitions adding 5 and 3 percentage points to the growth rate respectively in 2008 we continued the execution of our ongoing globalization strategy and our focus on emerging markets as approximately 50 percent of our sales during 2008 were to nonus customers sales in emerging markets grew at above our average growth rate we demonstrated improved performance in the asiapacific region with particular strength in china and india the growth rate in asiapacific accelerated every quarter during 2008 resulting in a full year organic growth rate of 15 percent compared to 2007 we continued to see strong organic growth in latin america of 14 percent benefiting from strength in resourcebased industries sales to customers in the united states canada and emea each grew at 45 percent organically 

in 2008 we experienced considerable growth in our key process and oem growth initiatives demonstrating the ongoing diversification of our revenue base we achieved above average growth in resourcebased industries primarily due to higher commodity prices infrastructure spending and continued demand for oil gas and other resources particularly in emerging markets sales to global automotive customers grew at about our average growth rate but us automotive growth was below our average growth rate sales to customers in the life sciences industries were significantly below our average growth rate our sales growth in the food and beverage and home and personal care industries was also below our average growth rate however these industries tend to provide for more consistent rates of growth over time 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization 

purchase accounting depreciation and amortization was 242 million in 2008 compared to 164 million in 2007 the increase was due to amortization of intangibles from recent acquisitions particularly cedes incuity pavilion and industrial control services group limited which does business as ics triplex 

general corporate — net 

general corporate expenses were 772 million in 2008 compared to 728 million in 2007 the increase was primarily due to lower interest and dividend income in 2008 compared to 2007 partially offset by reduced charitable contributions in 2008 and lower environmental remediation charges at legacy sites compared to 2007 

interest expense 

interest expense was 682 million in 2008 compared to 634 million in 2007 the increase was due to higher average outstanding borrowings partially offset by lower interest rates than the prior year 

special charges 

in 2008 we incurred special charges of 507 million 340 million after tax or 023 per diluted share related to restructuring actions designed to better align resources with growth opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions this current year charge was partially offset by the reversal of 40 million 36 million net of tax or 002 per diluted share of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions as employee attrition differed from our original estimates the 2008 restructuring actions include workforce reductions aimed at streamlining administrative functions realigning selling resources 

  

to the highest anticipated growth opportunities and consolidating business units we expect total cash expenditures associated with the 2008 actions to be approximately 507 million we expect to pay the majority of the costs associated with these actions in the first half of 2009 

special charges of 435 million in 2007 include costs related to various restructuring actions designed to execute on our cost productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy actions included workforce reductions realignment of administrative functions and rationalization and consolidation of global operations we paid 166 million related to these charges during the year ended september 30 2008 and 53 million during the year ended september 30 2007 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2008 was 286 percent compared to 278 percent in 2007 the effective tax rate in 2008 was lower than the statutory tax rate of 35 percent because of lower tax rates on income outside the united states and because we used foreign tax credits the tax rate in 2008 was higher than 2007 because we favorably resolved various federal and state matters in the prior year 

the 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower nonus tax rates resolved certain tax matters and claims related to the closure of the 2005 us federal audit cycle and various state tax audits and made other provision adjustments 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2008 and 2007 affecting the respective tax rates 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations in 2008 increased 83 million compared to 2007 the increase was primarily due to productivity performance and higher volume partially offset by increased investment spending to support globalization growth and technology increased purchase accounting depreciation and amortization inflation and a higher effective income tax rate 

discontinued operations 

amounts reported for discontinued operations in 2007 primarily relate to the operating results of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment for periods before the divestiture and the gain on sale of the principal businesses of that operating segment net income on operating activities of power systems was 423 million in 2007 we reported an aftertax gain on the sale of power systems of 8682 million 539 per share in 2007

segment operating margin increased 07 points in 2007 compared to 2006 due to productivity efforts price increases and lower retirement benefits expense partially offset by inflation and spending to support growth 

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 

 

   

our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy we account for sharebased compensation under sfas 123r sharebased payment  which requires us to report the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies 

our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects us federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds these taxes paid in 2008 and 2007 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses 

free cash flow was a source of 4583 million for the year ended september 30 2008 compared to 5310 million for the year ended september 30 2007 this decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to increased working capital needs and higher capital expenditures 

in december 2007 we issued an aggregate of 500 million principal amount of our 565 notes due 2017 and 625 debentures due 2037 the debt offering yielded approximately 4935 million of proceeds which were used to repay at maturity our 615 notes due january 15 2008 and for general corporate purposes 

in january 2007 we received 175 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we used the cash proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of the divestiture to pay taxes on the gain on sale and to acquire ics triplex 

commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2008 were 1000 million the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 225 percent at september 30 2007 commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 1730 million with a weighted average interest rate of 51 percent 

in 2008 we repurchased approximately 67 million shares of our common stock of which 01 million shares did not settle until october 2008 the total cost of these shares was 3551 million of which 35 million was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2008 this is compared to purchases of approximately 238 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 15061 million in 2007 of these purchases 01 million shares amounting to 75 million did not settle until october 2007 and were recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2007 we anticipate repurchasing stock in 2009 the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions stock price and other cash requirements at september 30 2008 we had approximately 6712 million remaining for stock repurchases under our existing board authorization see part ii item 5 market for the company’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for additional information regarding share repurchases 

we expect future uses of cash to include repayments of shortterm borrowings repurchases of common stock dividends to shareowners capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans recent declines in the value of our pension plan assets may impact the amount and timing of future contributions to our pension plans we expect capital expenditures in 2009 to be about 130 million we expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities 

  

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototalcapital ratio was 373 percent at september 30 2008 and 347 percent at september 30 2007 

in october 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility our credit facility remains in effect and we had not drawn down under it at september 30 2008 or 2007 borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of our credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility at september 30 2008 and 2007 our credit facility expires in october 2009 we are in active discussions with our bank group to renew the facility and we do not anticipate any problems associated with the renewal in addition to our 6000 million credit facility shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1677 million at september 30 2008 were available to foreign subsidiaries 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2008 

 

 among other uses we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the commercial paper ratings set forth in the table above under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

our ability to access the commercial paper market and the related costs of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

we regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 

cash dividends to shareowners were 1702 million 116 per share in 2008 1847 million 116 per share in 2007 and 1593 million 090 per share in 2006 although we declare and pay dividends at the sole discretion of our board of directors in 2009 we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of 029 per outstanding share

 supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

retirement benefits 

pension benefits 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2008 was 286 million compared to 463 million in 2007 approximately 48 percent of our 2008 global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2008 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 650 percent compared to 650 percent for 2007 expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent compared to 800 percent for 2007 and an assumed compensation increase rate of 415 percent compared to 419 percent for 2007 

in 2007 we made voluntary contributions of 80 million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust we made no voluntary contributions in 2008 

the pension protection act of 2006 was signed into law in august 2006 the irs has yet to issue final guidance with respect to certain aspects of this law however our 2008 pension plan valuation has been completed based on the current understanding of the law this valuation resulted in no minimum contributions being required in 2008 

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately 340 million in 2009 an increase of approximately 54 million from 2008 in addition the change in our measurement date in 2009 from june 30 to september 30 as required by sfas 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 will result in a reduction in retained earnings of approximately 85 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 for 2009 our us discount rate will increase to 675 percent the discount rate was set as of our june 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans our assumed rate of return on us plan assets will remain at 800 percent we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption we have assumed a us compensation increase rate of 420 percent in 2009 compared to 415 percent used in 2008 we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension eligible earnings 

the changes in our discount rate and return on plan assets have an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost the change in our discount rate also has an inverse relationship with our projected benefit obligation the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumption for our us pension plans in millions 

 

   

consistent with declines in global equity markets and volatility in fixed income markets we have experienced a decline in our pension assets after our june 30 2008 measurement date we have also observed fluctuations in the variables affecting our discount rate that would have significantly increased our discount rate since our june 30 2008 measurement date if we were to measure our us pension plans as of september 30 2008 using the same approach as we used for our june 30 2008 actual measurement date our 2009 us pension expense would have decreased by approximately 15 million to 1 million 

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

other postretirement benefits 

we estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions including the discount rate and for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program expected trends in the cost for healthcare services changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods the discount rate used to calculate our 2008 other postretirement benefits expense was 625 percent compared to 650 percent in 2007 for 2009 the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will increase to 650 percent the discount rate was set as of our june 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

effective october 1 2002 we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services as a result of this amendment our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare costs resulting from inflationary trends since january 1 2005 

net periodic benefit cost recorded in continuing operations in 2008 was 154 million compared to 130 million in 2007 we expect net periodic benefit cost in 2009 of approximately 159 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate 212 million in addition the change in our measurement date in 2009 from june 30 to september 30 as required by sfas 158 will result in a reduction in retained earnings of approximately 39 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 

more information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered 

we recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii unitsofdelivery under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

  

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 71 million 

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1378 million at september 30 2008 and 1286 million at september 30 2007 of which 132 million at september 30 2008 and 81 million at september 30 2007 was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

fair value measurements 

we have increased the use of fair value measurements in our financial statements due to recent accounting pronouncements and obligations retained in connection with the sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation under sfas 123r compensation costs are based on the grantdate fair value of the instruments using a valuation model and are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term we estimate the average riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield expected volatility and expected term of the compensation instrument outstanding in order to determine fair value the valuation model is most sensitive to the expected volatility and term assumptions sharebased compensation expense net of the related income tax benefit amounted to 215 million in 2008 and 188 million in 2007 

asset retirement obligations 

we account for conditional asset retirement obligations under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 47 we accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 51 million in other current liabilities and 228 million in other liabilities at september 30 2008 and 53 million in other current liabilities and 218 million in other liabilities at september 30 2007 

indemnifications 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal 

  

environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale we recorded a liability under fasb interpretation no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others – an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34 fin 45 related to these indemnification obligations as a reduction to the gain on sale a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 276 million of which 105 million and 96 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and 129 million and 161 million has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively 

derivatives 

our accounting method for derivative instruments is based on sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 the fair value of all derivative financial instruments is recorded in the balance sheet which is based on the quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain thirdparty and intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next two years cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies we sometimes use interest rate swap contacts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt unrealized gains on derivative instruments are recorded in other current assets in the amounts of 61 million and 52 million as of september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively and in other assets in the amount of 51 million at september 30 2008 unrealized losses on derivative instruments are recorded in other current liabilities in the amounts of 162 million and 382 million as of september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively and in other liabilities in the amount of 84 million at september 30 2008 

purchase accounting 

when we acquire a business we account for the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  in order to value acquired identifiable intangible assets and determine their amortizable lives management must use judgment in selecting relevant assumptions see note 2 in the financial statements for a discussion of acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our reserve for environmental matters net of related receivables of 228 million was 332 million at september 30 2008 and 298 million at september 30 2007 our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the 

  

responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 230 million at september 30 2008 and 240 million at september 30 2007 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see part i item 3 for further discussion 

more information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 17 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and foreign jurisdictions additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities may assert interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 48 as of october 1 2007 as a result we recognized a 67 million decrease in shareowners’ equity the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties recorded in accordance with fin 48 and reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet was 1258 million at september 30 2008 and 1165 million at october 1 2007 upon fin 48 adoption the majority of the increase is due to tax positions related to the current year the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized was 432 million at september 30 2008 and 376 million at october 1 2007 in addition the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would be reported in discontinued operations if recognized was 334 million at september 30 2008 and 338 million at october 1 2007 we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense total accrued interest and penalties were 260 million at september 30 2008 and 188 million at september 30 2007 we believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to 10 million during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations 

we recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 451 million at september 30 2008 and 426 million at september 30 2007 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforward amount will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards than currently expected 

  

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate which is the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects we recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they are realizable

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency in addition we enter into contracts to hedge certain thirdparty sales and intercompany transactions forecasted to occur within the next two years contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries the fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is a liability of 246 million and an asset of 112 million at september 30 2008 we enter into these contracts with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to us dollars in 2008 the relative weakening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens 

certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities for such assets and liabilities without offsetting forward foreign exchange contracts a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pretax income by approximately 10 million 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately the ineffective portion was not significant in 2008 and 2007 

at september 30 2008 and 2007 we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the swiss franc euro british pound sterling canadian dollar and 

  

singapore dollar the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents in millions of net transactional foreign exchange exposure related to short long contracts outstanding by currency 

 

 all of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future we designated certain of these contracts related to thirdparty sales or intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through october 2010 as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our consolidated balance sheet 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings at september 30 2008 we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 1000 million with remaining maturities of six days at a weighted average interest rate of 225 percent at september 30 2007 we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 1730 million with remaining maturities of three days at a weighted average interest rate of 51 percent the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper borrowings was 29 percent during 2008 and 53 percent during 2007 as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2008 and 2007 a 10 percent increase in average interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations in 2008 a 100 percent increase in average market interest rates would have increased our interest expense by 79 million we use a 100 percent hypothetical fluctuation as our actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2008 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 9044 million at september 30 2008 and 7539 million at september 30 2007 the fair value of this debt was 8830 million at september 30 2008 and 7773 million at september 30 2007 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as previously disclosed we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprisewide information technology system in the fourth quarter of 2008 we deployed new business processes and functionality of the system related to our travel and expense reporting time reporting and purchasing functions to certain locations in doing so we modified and enhanced our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f as a result of and in connection with the implementation of the new system and processes in the fourth quarter of 2008 we also launched a pilot deployment to one business at a location in mexico additional implementations will occur to most locations of our company over a multiyear period with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 20092012 

there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended september 30 2008 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

the company’s name and its registered trademark “rockwell automation ® ” is important to each of our business segments in addition we own other important trademarks that we use such as “allenbradley ® ” “ab ® ” and “ics triplex ™ ” for electronic controls and systems for industrial automation and “rockwell software ® ” for our software products 

seasonality

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 

approximately 46 percent of our revenues in 2007 were outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on continued growth in our nonus sales numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability changes in local governmental laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation trade controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights international transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs including risks of noncompliance with us and local laws affecting our activities abroad in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates while these factors and their impacts are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

an inability to anticipate changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 

general economic business or industry conditions may result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global industrial production as economic activity slows down or credit markets tighten companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending resulting in decreased demand for our products if this occurs our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected 

information technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business 

we depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives if we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure such as a computer virus a problem with the functioning of an important it application or an intentional disruption of our it systems the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 

we are implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that will redesign and deploy new processes organization structures and a common information system over a period of several years our first significant rollouts of the system occurred at several of our us locations in fiscal 2007 and will continue at additional locations in 2008 as we implement the erp system the new system may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

there are additional risks in our growing solutions businesses 

risks inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors our inability to control manage and mitigate these risks could adversely affect our results of operations 

the global industrial automation power control and information products and services industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects including pricing product performance quality developing integrated systems and applications that address the business challenges faced by our customers and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the markets and product areas that we serve price competition in our served markets is intense we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems if we fail to keep pace with technological changes or provide high quality products and services we may experience price erosion and lower revenues and margins we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

a disruption to our distribution channel could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

in the united states and canada approximately 85 percent of our sales are through a limited number of third party distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a disruption could be caused by the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of the distributor or other events 

  

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims could adversely affect our business 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability safety and health employment and contract matters we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

the inability to secure and maintain rights to intellectual property could harm our business and our customers 

we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the loss of patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant in addition others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we regularly provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely on third party suppliers which creates certain risks and uncertainties 

our manufacturing processes require that we buy a high volume of equipment components and materials from third party suppliers our reliance on these suppliers involves certain risks including 

 

  

  

 any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where alternative sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 

potential liabilities and costs for environmental remediation could adversely affect our business 

our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility for the cleanup or other remediation of contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities related to our current and divested businesses to avoid an adverse effect on our tax expense and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the 

  

subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses in prior years we retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds for periods before the divestitures as a result from time to time we may be required to make payments related to tax matters associated with those divested businesses 

our competitiveness depends on successfully executing on our globalization and cost productivity initiatives 

our globalization strategy includes localization of our products and services to be near our customers and identified growth opportunities localization of our products and services includes expanding our capabilities including supply chain and sourcing activities product design manufacturing engineering marketing and sales and support these activities expose us to risks including those related to political and economic uncertainties transportation delays labor market disruptions and challenges to protect our intellectual property in addition we continue with our initiative to invest in actions to reduce our cost structure the failure to achieve our objectives on these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we face the potential harms of natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts and the actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create political or economic instability any of which could have an adverse effect on our business although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products or disrupt our supply chain 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

  

  

 future acquisitions could cause us to incur debt dilution contingent liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 

  




 item 2 properties 

at september 30 2007 we operated 53 plants principally in north america we also had 267 sales and administrative offices and a total of 26 warehouses service centers and other facilities the aggregate floor space of our facilities was approximately 102 million square feet of this floor space we owned approximately 24 percent and leased approximately 76 percent manufacturing space occupied approximately 41 million square feet our architecture  software segment occupied approximately 08 million square feet our control products  solutions segment occupied approximately 28 million square feet and the remaining approximately 05 million square feet of manufacturing space was shared by our operating segments at september 30 2007 approximately 311000 square feet of floor space was not in use mostly in owned facilities 

in november 2005 we sold and leased back 8 properties in north america comprising approximately 16 million square feet see note 17 in the financial statements for more information 

there are no major encumbrances other than financing arrangements which in the aggregate are not significant on any of our plants or equipment in our opinion our properties have been well maintained are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels 




 item 3 legal proceedings  

rocky flats plant ric operated the rocky flats plant the plant golden colorado from 1975 through december 1989 for the department of energy doe incident to boeing’s acquisition of ric in 1996 we assumed and agreed to indemnify ric and boeing for any liability arising out of ric’s activities at the plant to the extent such liability is not assumed or indemnified by the government and ric and boeing assigned to us the right to any reimbursements or other proceeds to which they might be entitled under ric’s rocky flats contracts with the doe 

on january 30 1990 a class action was filed in the united states district court for the district of colorado against ric and another former operator of the plant the action alleges the improper production handling and disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances constituting among other things violations of various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto on october 8 1993 the court certified separate medical monitoring and property value classes on february 14 2006 a jury empanelled to try certain of the class action plaintiffs’ property damage claims found the contractor defendants liable for trespass and nuisance and awarded 176 million in compensatory damages and 200 million in punitive damages against the two defendants collectively the jury also found ric to be 10 responsible for the trespass and 70 responsible for the nuisance no appealable judgment has been entered on the jury verdict in part because the court has yet to decide how the damages are to be allocated between the defendants and among the plaintiff class members appeals are likely after judgment is entered effective august 1 1996 the doe assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants including ric in the action and has either reimbursed or paid directly the costs of ric’s defense we believe that ric is entitled under applicable law and its contract with the doe to be indemnified for the verdict and other costs associated with this action 

on november 13 1990 ric was served with another civil action brought against it in the same court by james stone claiming to act in the name of the united states alleging violations of the us false claims act in connection with its operation of the plant and seeking treble damages and forfeitures on december 6 1995 the doe notified ric that it would no longer reimburse costs incurred by ric in defense of the action on november 19 1996 the court granted the department of justice leave to intervene in the case on the government’s behalf on april 1 1999 a jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately 14 million in damages on may 18 1999 the court entered judgment against ric for approximately 42 million trebling the jury’s award as required by the false claims act and imposing a civil penalty of 15000 on september 24 2001 a panel of the 10 th circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment and held that mr stone was entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees on march 27 2007 the supreme court reversed the findings of the lower courts and held that 

  

mr stone was not a proper relator with respect to the claims on which ric was found liable as a result of this ruling ric will not be liable for mr stone’s attorney’s fees we are making arrangements to pay 42 million plus interest that ric now owes to the us government we believe that ric is entitled under applicable law and its contract with the doe to be indemnified for all costs and any liability associated with this action however as described below the civilian board of contract appeals has denied ric’s claim seeking reimbursement of certain of those costs 

on january 8 1991 ric filed suit in the united states court of federal claims against the doe seeking recovery of 65 million of award fees that it alleges are owed to it under the terms of its contract with the doe for management and operation of the plant during the period october 1 1988 through september 30 1989 on january 18 2007 the court entered judgment in ric’s favor which will require the doe to pay us 31 million plus interest since 1991 this judgment is no longer subject to appeal and we received 60 million from the doe on july 2 2007 on may 4 2005 ric filed another claim with the doe seeking recovery of 113 million in unreimbursed costs incurred in defense of the stone suit on september 30 2005 the doe contracting officer denied that claim and demanded repayment of 4 million in previously reimbursed stone defense costs on november 10 2005 ric appealed both aspects of the contracting officer’s decision regarding stone defense costs to the civilian board of contract appeals on july 9 2007 the board ruled that the doe is entitled to be repaid the previously reimbursed stone defense costs and that ric cannot recover its unreimbursed costs further proceedings before the board to determine the amount to be repaid are in their early stages any appeals from the board’s rulings will be filed only after these further proceedings are concluded 

russellville on march 24 1997 the circuit court of franklin county kentucky in commonwealth of kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet vs rockwell  an action filed in 1986 seeking remediation of pcb contamination resulting from unpermitted discharges of pcbs from a plant in russellville kentucky owned and operated by ric’s measurement  flow control division before its divestiture in march 1989 entered judgment establishing pcb cleanup levels for the former plant site and certain offsite property and ordering additional characterization of possible contamination in the mud river and its flood plain the court deferred any decision to impose civil penalties pending implementation of an appropriate remediation program on august 13 1999 the court of appeals affirmed the trial court’s judgment a ruling that the kentucky supreme court has let stand we have been proceeding with remediation and characterization efforts consistent with the trial court’s ruling on august 2 2007 the court executed and approved a final agreed order amending the court’s 1997 judgment as a result we paid a civil penalty of 20 million and made donations for supplemental environmental projects “seps” totaling 55 million we also entered into a separate agreement with the kentucky natural resource trustees and paid 25 million in natural resource damages the final order also replaces the pcb cleanup levels established by the court in 1997 with the remediation standards and procedures embodied in a new kentucky regulation codified at 401 kar 100030 we will continue our remediation efforts under these new standards this final agreed order dispenses with all issues remaining open from the court’s 1997 judgment and conclusively resolves any and all claims by the state of kentucky pertaining to the original action 

asbestos like thousands of other companies we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies the great majority of cases do not allege exposure to any asbestoscontaining product that we or our predecessors manufactured or sold 

in addition when our products appear to be identified in some cases they are from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs however we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us which occurred on january 31 2007 but in all cases for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of the products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing 

  

medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for most of these claims we initiated litigation in the milwaukee county circuit court on february 12 2004 to enforce the insurance policies against nationwide indemnity company and kemper insurance the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to our former allenbradley subsidiary as a result the insurance carriers have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims subject to policy limits if either carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits of either carrier are exhausted our share of future defense and indemnity costs may increase however coverage under excess policies may be available to pay some or all of these costs 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term solvency of our insurance companies make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

foreign corrupt practices act as a result of an internal review we determined during the fourth quarter of 2006 that actions by a small number of employees at certain of our operations in one jurisdiction may have violated the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or other applicable laws we and some of our distributors do business in this jurisdiction with government owned enterprises or government owned enterprises that are evolving to commercial businesses these actions involved payments for nonbusiness travel expenses and certain other business arrangements involving potentially improper payment mechanisms for legitimate business expenses special outside counsel has been engaged to investigate the actions and report to the audit committee their review is ongoing 

we voluntarily disclosed these actions to the us department of justice “doj” and the securities and exchange commission “sec” beginning in september 2006 we are implementing thorough remedial measures and are cooperating on these issues with the doj and sec we have agreed to update the doj and sec periodically regarding any further developments as the investigation continues 

if violations of the fcpa occurred we may be subject to consequences that could include fines penalties other costs and businessrelated impacts we could also face similar consequences from local authorities we do not believe the consequences of this investigation the remediation or any related penalties or business related impacts will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

overview 

we are a leading global provider of industrial automation power control and information products and services overall demand for our products and services is driven by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 u s industrial economic trends 

in 2007 sales to us customers accounted for 54 percent of our total sales the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served us markets include 

 

  

  

   

the table below depicts the continued general gradual improvement in us industrial equipment spending since december 2004 capacity utilization has remained above 80 percent since december 2005 while the pmi has sustained a rate over 50 since december 2004 although we have seen consistent strength over the past few years in the manufacturing indicators we follow we are seeing a deceleration in the rate of manufacturing growth in the north american market 

 

 note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

nonus regional trends 

in 2007 sales to nonus customers accounted for 46 percent of our total sales outside the us demand for our products and services is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers’ ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets these customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and a growing number of local companies recent strength in demand for our products and services has in part been driven by investments in infrastructure in developing economies investments in basic materials production capacity in response to higher commodity pricing and expanding consumer markets we continued to see strong demand in china india and latin america during 2007 we also saw considerable growth in europe during 2007 as we benefited from our targeted growth investments in customerfacing resources and improving macroeconomic conditions we expect strong growth in latin america europe and the emerging economies in asiapacific to continue into 2008 

  

revenue by geographic region 

the table below presents our actual sales for the year ended september 30 2007 by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended september 30 2006 in millions except percentages 

 

   

 industry views 

we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer resourcebased and transportation 

our consumer industry customers are engaged in the food and beverage home and personal care and life sciences industries these customers’ needs include global expansion incremental capacity from existing facilities an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance in addition these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors consumer products customers’ capital investments are generally less cyclical than those of resourcebased customers 

our customers in resourcebased industries including oil and gas mining aggregates metals waterwastewater forest products and cement all benefit from higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic materials both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider investing in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor controls 

in transportation factors such as excess capacity geographic expansion investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales 

outlook for 2008 

the following is a summary of our key objectives for 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

   

our outlook for 2008 is based on anticipated strength in customer demand in europe and emerging markets we believe our investments in technology leadership expanded served markets and stronger global presence are creating more worldwide opportunities for growth than ever before despite a deceleration in the rate of manufacturing growth in the north american market this ongoing diversification of our revenue base combined with our recent acquisitions cause us to be optimistic that 2008 will be another good year we remain intensely focused on executing our growth and productivity initiatives as we continue to evolve our global footprint not just in manufacturing but in engineering back office and customer support infrastructure 

as of the date of filing this report based upon current economic conditions and business trends we expect revenue to grow by 10 to 12 percent in 2008 we anticipate acquisitions will contribute approximately 3 percentage points to this growth rate and that our services and solutions business will continue to become a larger portion of our revenue we also believe that we will continue to benefit from the strong momentum in our growth initiatives particularly process applications and safety we expect continued growth from the commercial investments we have made in emea and latin america continued strength in emerging markets and improved performance in the asiapacific region especially china offset by somewhat slower rates of growth in developed economies 

as of the date hereof we also expect 2008 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 425 to 445 this includes an expected effective income tax rate that will average about 28 to 29 percent for the full year subject to quarterly variability we anticipate an earnings benefit from volume leverage productivity initiatives and a decrease in our year over year average share count these items will be partially offset by our investments in new products services technologies and expertise to serve new applications and markets combined with inflation in material and employee costs and the globalization of our business model we also expect acquisitions will put downward pressure on operating margin and that combined with purchase accounting expense will have a negative impact on diluted earnings per share we also plan to generate free cash flow of approximately 95 percent of net income in 2008

general corporate — net 

general corporate expenses were 728 million in 2007 compared to 907 million in 2006 the decrease is due primarily to interest income on the proceeds of the power systems sale expenses during 2007 also include charges of 139 million related to environmental remediation costs at legacy sites partially offset by a 121 million dividend related to an equity interest we acquired as a result of the divestiture of our firstpoint contact business

interest expense 

interest expense was 634 million in 2007 compared to 566 million in 2006 the increase was due to higher average commercial paper borrowings in 2007 as well as higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap see note 6 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2007 was 278 percent compared to 281 percent in 2006 the 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower nonus tax rates resolved certain tax matters and claims related to the closure of the 2005 us federal audit cycle and various state tax audits and made other provision adjustments 

the 2006 effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we reversed 272 million 015 per diluted share of valuation allowances on capital loss carryforwards settled audit matters with the us internal revenue service for the years 2003 and 2004 benefited from lower tax rates outside the us received foreign sales corporation fsc and extra territorial income eti tax benefits and made other provision adjustments

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 

 

 our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy in the first quarter of 2006 we adopted sfas 123r see note 11 in the financial statements which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash 

  

flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as defined as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies 

our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations operating investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects us federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds these taxes paid in 2007 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses 

free cash flow was 5310 million for the year ended september 30 2007 compared to 2384 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the increase in free cash flow was largely the result of the 4500 million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan trust in 2006 compared to 80 million of voluntary contributions in 2007 this increase was partially offset by increased working capital requirements during 2007 

in january 2007 we received 175 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we used the cash proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of the divestiture to pay taxes on the gain on sale and to acquire industrial control services group limited ics triplex 

in 2007 we repurchased approximately 238 million shares of our common stock of which 01 million shares did not settle until october 2007 the total cost of these shares was 15061 million of which 75 million was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2007 this is compared to purchases of approximately 122 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 7431 million in 2006 of these purchases 04 million shares amounting to 206 million did not settle until october 2006 and were recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2006 we anticipate repurchasing stock in 2008 the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions stock price and other cash requirements at september 30 2007 we had approximately 263 million remaining for stock repurchases under an existing board authorization on november 7 2007 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional 10 billion of shares of our common stock 

we expect future significant uses of cash to include repayments of shortterm borrowings and the 3500 million notes due in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 repurchases of common stock dividends to shareowners capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans we expect capital expenditures in 2008 to be about 145 million we expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities longterm borrowings commercial paper borrowings or proceeds from the sale of our securities in the capital markets on november 7 2007 our board of directors authorized us to issue up to 500 million of longterm debt the proceeds of this debt if issued primarily would be used to reduce outstanding debt including retiring the 350 million notes due in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototalcapital ratio was 347 percent at september 30 2007 and 335 percent at september 30 2006 our debttototalcapital ratio at september 30 2007 was influenced by the adoption of sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r that occurred during 2007 

  

commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2007 were 1730 million the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 51 percent at september 30 2006 commercial paper borrowings outstanding were 2190 million with a weighted average interest rate of 54 percent 

in october 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility our credit facility remains in effect and we had not drawn down under it at september 30 2007 or 2006 borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of our credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility at september 30 2007 and 2006 in addition to our 6000 million credit facility shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1723 million at september 30 2007 were available to foreign subsidiaries in september 2006 we entered into a 364day 2500 million unsecured revolving credit facility we terminated our 2500 million credit facility effective march 30 2007 as we no longer considered the liquidity provided by this facility to be necessary 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2007 

 

 among other uses we can draw our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

cash dividends to shareowners were 1847 million 116 per share in 2007 1593 million 090 per share in 2006 and 1427 million 078 per share in 2005 although we declare and pay dividends at the sole discretion of our board of directors we expect to pay quarterly dividends in 2008 of at least 029 per outstanding share 

a summary of our contractual cash obligations at september 30 2007 are in millions 

 

    

  

  

  

  

 supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency rates affect our reported sales sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales we believe that organic sales defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions made during the period we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect in the prior year we determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year no adjustments have been made to 2006 sales for acquisitions as the effect was not significant we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management in prior years we listed impairment of longlived assets as a critical accounting policy and estimate the most subjective portion of this balance was the reliance trademark relating to the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment with the sale of these businesses including the related trademark impairment of longlived assets is no longer considered a critical accounting policy and estimate 

retirement benefits 

pension benefits 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2007 was 463 million compared to 716 million in 2006 approximately 57 percent of our 2007 global pension expense relates to our us pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2007 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 650 percent compared to 525 percent for 2006 expected rate of return on plan assets of 800 percent compared to 850 percent for 2006 and an assumed compensation increase rate of 419 percent compared to 406 percent for 2006 the increase in the us discount rate partially offset by the decrease in the expected rate of return on the us plan assets accounts for the majority of the decline in our global pension expense 

in 2007 we made voluntary contributions of 80 million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to 4500 million in 2006 

the pension protection act of 2006 was signed into law in august 2006 interpretive guidance is still evolving we are currently evaluating this legislation and the effect it will have on our future pension contributions 

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately 296 million in 2008 a decrease of approximately 167 million from 2007 for 2008 our us discount rate will remain at 650 percent the discount rate was set as of our june 30 th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans our assumed rate of return on us plan assets will remain at 800 percent we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption we intend over time to change the us plan’s mix of investments by increasing the weighting in debt securities we have assumed a us compensation increase rate of 415 percent in 2008 compared to 419 percent used in 2007 we established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension eligible earnings 

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumption for our us pension plans in millions 

 

   

more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

other postretirement benefits 

we estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions including the discount rate and for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program expected trends in the cost for healthcare services changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods the discount rate used to calculate our 2007 other postretirement benefits expense was 650 percent compared to 500 percent in 2006 for 2008 the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to 625 percent the discount rate was set as of our june 30 th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

effective october 1 2002 we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services as a result of this amendment our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare costs resulting from inflationary trends since january 1 2005 

net periodic benefit cost recorded in continuing operations in 2007 was 130 million compared to 187 million in 2006 we expect net periodic benefit cost in 2008 of approximately 155 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate 2274 million the increase in net periodic benefit cost is due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate by 25 basis points to 625 percent 

more information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for approximately 90 percent of our consolidated sales we record sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered we recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii unitsofdelivery under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer oem customer to whom our 

  

distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 60 million 

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1286 million at september 30 2007 and 1112 million at september 30 2006 of which 81 million at september 30 2007 and 85 million at september 30 2006 was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

fair value measurements 

we have increased the use of fair value measurements in our financial statements due to recent accounting pronouncements and obligations retained in connection with the sale of the principal businesses of our former power systems operating segment 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased compensation under sfas 123r compensation costs are based on the grantdate fair value of the instruments using a valuation model and are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term we estimate the average riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield expected volatility and expected term of the compensation instrument outstanding in order to determine fair value the valuation model is most sensitive to the expected volatility and term assumptions sharebased compensation expense net of the related income tax benefit amounted to 188 million in 2007 and 167 million in 2006 

asset retirement obligations 

we account for conditional asset retirement obligations under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 47 we accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates the application of fin 47 resulted in a charge net of tax of 177 million included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september 30 2006 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we recorded these liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet which totaled 53 million in other current liabilities and 218 million in other liabilities at september 30 2007 and 287 million in other liabilities at september 30 2006 

indemnifications 

in conjunction with the sale of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses we agreed to indemnify baldor for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal 

  

environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before january 31 2007 for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the purchase price we recorded a liability under fasb interpretation no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others — an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34 fin 45 related to these indemnification obligations with an offset to the gain on sale a significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates we estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate 325 million of which 96 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and 161 million has been accrued in other liabilities at september 30 2007 

derivatives 

our accounting method for derivative instruments is based on sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 the fair value of all derivative financial instruments is recorded in the balance sheet which is based on the quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies we sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt unrealized gains on derivative instruments are recorded in other current assets and total 52 million and 19 million at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively unrealized losses on derivative instruments are recorded in other current liabilities and total 382 million and 85 million at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively 

purchase accounting 

when we acquire a business we account for the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  the valuation of acquired identifiable intangible assets and determination of their amortizable lives requires the use of management judgment and assumptions see note 2 in the financial statements for a discussion of acquisitions in 2007 and 2006 

litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

our reserve for environmental matters net of related receivables was 298 million at september 30 2007 and 370 million at september 30 2006 the change is primarily due to a legal settlement and changes in estimated remediation costs at three sites as a result of new information 

  

our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability as described in item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see item 3 for further discussion 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 240 million at september 30 2007 and 258 million at september 30 2006 

more information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 17 in the financial statements 

income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by us federal state and foreign jurisdictions additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures we regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties if any according to the principles of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies sfas 5 we have recorded an accrual of 1045 million at september 30 2007 and 851 million at september 30 2006 that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit in the first quarter of 2008 we will adopt fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 upon adoption of this standard we will assess our position with regard to tax exposures and uncertain tax positions under its requirements rather than under sfas 5 the adoption of fin 48 as of october 1 2007 will result in a decrease to shareowners’ equity of up to 10 million 

we have recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards and certain temporary differences in the amount of 426 million at september 30 2007 and 368 million at september 30 2006 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforward amount will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more carryforwards than currently expected 

  

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate which is the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects we recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they are realizable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings at september 30 2007 we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 1730 million with original maturities of three days at a weighted average interest rate of 51 percent at september 30 2006 we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 2190 million with original maturities of three days at a weighted average interest rate of 54 percent the weighted average interest rate on the commercial paper borrowings was 53 percent during 2007 and 48 percent during 2006 as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2007 and 2006 a 10 percent increase in average market interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 7539 million at september 30 2007 and 7482 million at september 30 2006 the fair value of this debt was 7773 million at september 30 2007 and 8037 million at september 30 2006 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity 

in september 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 615 notes payable in 2008 to floating rate debt based on sixmonth libor the floating rate was 780 percent at september 30 2007 a hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and 

  

transactions denominated in foreign currencies our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency in addition we enter into contracts to hedge certain intercompany transactions forecasted to occur within the next three years contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to us dollars a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately 

at september 30 2007 and 2006 we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro british pound sterling swiss franc singapore dollar and south korean won the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents in millions of net transactional foreign exchange exposure related to short long contracts outstanding by currency 

 

 all of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future we designated certain of these contracts related to intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through october 2010 as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our consolidated balance sheet

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have evaluated the effectiveness as of september 30 2007 of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e of the exchange act based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2007 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based upon that evaluation management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2007 

on july 2 2007 we acquired industrial control services group limited dba ics triplex whose financial statements constitute 13 percent and 7 percent of net and total assets respectively 1 percent of net sales and zero percent of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended september 30 2007 we excluded ics triplex from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting at september 30 2007 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as previously disclosed we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprisewide information technology system in the fourth quarter of 2007 we implemented the manufacturing logistics and nonmanufacturing purchasing processes and functionality of the system to additional locations in doing so we modified and enhanced our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f as a result of and in connection with the implementation of the new system and processes we also implemented a pilot rollout to one location of our field support services additional implementations will occur to most locations of our company over a multiyear period with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 20082010 

there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended september 30 2007 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

effective october 1 2006 we have realigned our internal management reporting structure the reporting structure changes include realignment of our control systems’ services and solutions offerings to report through the components and packaged applications group cpag additionally the power systems custom drives and drives related parts and services business has been realigned to also report through cpag as a result of changes in the internal management reporting structure we will begin reporting the historical control systems operating segment as two separate operating segments in our first quarter of 2007 

control systems 

control systems is our largest operating segment with 2006 sales of 46 billion 82 percent of our total sales and approximately 19000 employees at september 30 2006 control systems supplies industrial automation products systems software and services focused on helping customers control and improve manufacturing processes the operating segment includes two main business groups cpag and the automation control and information group acig 

cpag supplies industrial components power control and motor management products and packaged and engineered products and systems cpag’s sales account for approximately 39 percent of control systems’ sales 

acig’s core products are used primarily to control and monitor industrial plants and processes and typically consist of a processor software and inputoutput io devices acig’s integrated architecture and logix controllers perform multiple types of control applications including discrete batch continuous process drive system motion and machine safety across various factory floor operations acig’s sales account for approximately 45 percent of control systems’ sales 

in addition control systems’ offerings also include services and solutions such as multivendor customer support training automation systems integration asset management and manufacturing information solutions for discrete and targeted batch process industries control systems’ service and solution offerings compete with emerson electric co general electric company invensys siemens ag and system integrators 

  the following is a summary of the major products and services and major competitors of control systems’ two main business groups 

 

depending on the product or service involved control systems’ competitors range from large diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation to smaller companies specializing in niche products and services factors that influence control systems’ competitive position are its broad product portfolio and scope of solutions technology leadership knowledge of customer applications large installed base established distribution network quality of products and services price and global presence 

control systems’ products are marketed primarily under the allenbradley ® and rockwell software ® brand names major markets served include consumer products transportation oil and gas mining metals and forest products 

in north america control systems’ products are sold primarily through independent distributors that typically do not carry products that compete with allenbradley ® products large systems and service offerings are sold principally through a direct sales force though opportunities are sometimes sourced through distributors or system integrators product sales outside the united states occur through a combination of direct sales sales through distributors and sales through system integrators 

in 2006 sales in the united states accounted for 57 percent of control systems’ sales outside the us control systems’ primary markets were canada china the united kingdom italy germany brazil australia korea and mexico 

control systems is headquartered in milwaukee wisconsin and has operations in north america europe middle east and africa asiapacific and latin america 

power systems 

power systems recorded 2006 sales of 10 billion 18 percent of our total sales and had approximately 4000 employees at september 30 2006 power systems consists of two business groups dodge mechanical mechanical and reliance electrical electrical 

  the following is a summary of the major products and services and major competitors of the power systems operating segment 

 

depending on the product involved power systems’ competitors range from large diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation to smaller companies specializing in niche products and services factors that influence power systems’ competitive position are product quality installed base price and our established distributor network while power systems’ competitive position is strong in the united states it is limited somewhat by its small presence outside the united states 

mechanical’s products are marketed primarily under the dodge ® brand name while electrical’s products are marketed primarily under the reliance ® and reliance electric tm brand names major markets served include mining cement aggregates environmental forest products foodbeverage oil and gas metals and material handling 

mechanical’s products are sold primarily through distributors while electrical’s products are sold primarily through a direct sales force 

in 2006 sales in the united states accounted for 85 percent of power systems’ sales outside the us power systems’ primary markets were canada china and mexico

employees 

at september 30 2006 we had approximately 23000 employees approximately 14000 were employed in the united states and of these employees about 5 percent were represented by various local or national unions 

raw materials and supplies

backlog 

our total order backlog was 9117 million at september 30 2006 and 7725 million at september 30 2005 backlog is not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods due to the shortcycle nature of most of our sales activities 

environmental protection requirements 

information about the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims is contained in note 17 in the financial statements see also item 3 legal proceedings  

patents licenses and trademarks 

we own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and operations various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have been made to us we believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition see item 3 legal proceedings  while in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the operation of our business we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property 

the company’s name and its registered trademark “rockwell automation ® ” is important to each of our business segments in addition we own other important trademarks that we use for certain products and services such as “allenbradley ® ” and “ab ® ” for electronic controls and systems for industrial automation “reliance ® ” and “reliance electric tm ” for electric motors and drives and “dodge ® ” for mechanical power transmission products although we have announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the principal businesses of our power systems operating segment we will retain the reliance electric tm and reliance ® branded drives business and related parts and services as an integral part of our global drives and services businesses we will retain a longterm license to the reliance ® and reliance electric tm trademarks in connection with the drives business

  risk factors tableend 

we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 

approximately 38 percent of our revenues in 2006 were outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability changes in local governmental laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs investments taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights international transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs including risks of noncompliance with us and local laws affecting our activities abroad in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates while these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

an inability to anticipate changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 

general economic business or industry conditions may result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global industrial production as economic activity slows down companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending resulting in decreased demand for our products if this occurs our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected 

information technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business 

we depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives if we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure such as a computer virus a problem with the functioning of an important it application or an intentional disruption of our it systems by a third party the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 

  we are in the process of introducing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that will redesign and deploy new processes organization structures and a common information system over a period of several years our first significant rollouts of the system are scheduled to occur at several of our us locations in fiscal 2007 as we implement the erp system the new system may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business 

the growth of our control systems solutions offerings may create additional risks 

risks inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficiently executing projects and managing the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors our inability to control manage and mitigate these risks could adversely affect our results of operations 

the global industrial automation power control and information products and services industry is highly competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several specific respects including pricing product performance developing integrated systems and applications that address the business challenges faced by our customers and customer service the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve price competition in our various industries is intense we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels by continually developing advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements if we fail to keep pace with technological changes we may experience price erosion and lower margins we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 

a disruption to our distribution channel could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

in the united states and canada approximately 75 percent of our sales are through a limited number of third party distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a disruption could be caused by the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of the distributor or other events 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation including asbestos claims could adversely affect our business 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability safety and health employment and contract matters we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution 

the inability to secure and maintain rights to intellectual property could harm our business and our customers 

we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the loss of patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant in addition others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we sometimes provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could have an adverse effect on our business 

dispositions of businesses involve risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy and longterm objectives may result in decisions to dispose of assets or businesses the disposition of assets or businesses can be highly uncertain in june 2006 we announced our intention to divest the principal businesses of our power systems operating segment and on november 7 2006 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell these businesses to baldor electric company the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval any failures or delays in satisfying closing conditions for this divestiture or difficulties in redeploying the proceeds to minimize the dilutive effect of the sale could have an adverse effect on our ability to execute on our strategy 

our reliance on third party suppliers creates certain risks and uncertainties 

our manufacturing processes require that we purchase a high volume of equipment components and materials from third party suppliers our reliance on these suppliers involves certain risks including 

 

  any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where alternative sources of supply are available qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 

potential liabilities and costs relating to environmental remediation could adversely affect our business 

our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility for the cleanup or other remediation of contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties that we currently own and use regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners 

we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future as well and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities related to our current and divested businesses could adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses in prior years we retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds for periods before the divestitures as a result from time to time we may be required to make payments related to tax matters associated with those divested businesses 

natural disasters terrorism acts of war international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations could harm our business 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts and the actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause damage or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create political or economic instability any of which could have an adverse effect on our business although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products or disrupt our supply chain 

our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue or profitability 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results 

risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us 

we have acquired and anticipate continuing to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including 

 

future acquisitions could cause us to incur debt dilution contingent liabilities increased interest expense and amortization expenses related to intangible assets impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges could also occur as a result of acquisitions

on january 30 1990 a class action was filed in the united states district court for the district of colorado against ric and another former operator of the plant the action alleges the improper production handling and disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances constituting among other things violations of various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto on october 8 1993 the court certified separate medical monitoring and property value classes on february 14 2006 a jury empanelled to try certain of the class action plaintiffs’ property damage claims found the contractor defendants liable for trespass and nuisance and awarded 176 million in compensatory damages and 200 million in punitive damages against the two defendants collectively the jury also found ric to be 10 responsible for the trespass and 70 responsible for the nuisance no appealable judgment has been entered on the jury verdict in part because the court has yet to decide how the damages are to be allocated between the defendants and among the plaintiff class members appeals are likely after judgment is entered effective august 1 1996 the doe assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants including ric in the action and has either reimbursed or paid directly the costs of ric’s defense we believe that ric is entitled under applicable law and its contract with the doe to be indemnified for the verdict and other costs associated with this action 

  on november 13 1990 ric was served with another civil action brought against it in the same court by james stone claiming to act in the name of the united states alleging violations of the us false claims act in connection with its operation of the plant and seeking treble damages and forfeitures on december 6 1995 the doe notified ric that it would no longer reimburse costs incurred by ric in defense of the action on november 19 1996 the court granted the department of justice leave to intervene in the case on the government’s behalf on april 1 1999 a jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately 14 million in damages on may 18 1999 the court entered judgment against ric for approximately 42 million trebling the jury’s award as required by the false claims act and imposing a civil penalty of 15000 if the judgment is affirmed on appeal mr stone will also be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees but the court refused to award fees until appeals from the judgment have been exhausted on september 24 2001 a panel of the 10 th circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment on november 2 2001 ric filed a petition for rehearing with the court of appeals seeking reconsideration of that portion of the decision holding that mr stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees on march 4 2002 the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of making findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to mr stone’s relator status and the trial court having made findings of fact on the issue on march 15 2004 a panel of the court of appeals again ruled that mr stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees on january 4 2006 the 10 th circuit court of appeals denied en banc review and on april 4 2006 ric filed a petition for certiorari seeking supreme court review of the 10 th circuit’s decision on september 25 2006 the supreme court granted our petition for certiorari and set the case for argument on december 5 2006 we believe that ric is entitled under applicable law and its contract with the doe to be indemnified for all costs and any liability associated with this action and ric has filed a claim with the doe seeking reimbursement that is described more fully below we believe that an outcome adverse to ric will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition 

on january 8 1991 ric filed suit in the united states court of federal claims against the doe seeking recovery of 65 million of award fees that it alleges are owed to it under the terms of its contract with the doe for management and operation of the plant during the period october 1 1988 through september 30 1989 on july 17 1996 the government filed an amended answer and counterclaim alleging violations of the us false claims act previously asserted in the stone civil action described in the preceding paragraph on may 4 2005 ric filed another claim with the doe seeking recovery of 113 million in unreimbursed costs incurred in defense of the stone suit on september 30 2005 the doe contracting officer denied that claim and demanded repayment of 4 million in previously reimbursed stone defense costs on november 10 2005 ric appealed both aspects of the contracting officer’s decision regarding stone defense costs to the energy board of contract appeals both parties have filed motions for summary judgment in the second quarter of 2006 we recorded a 50 million 30 million aftertax accrual in discontinued operations for legal contingencies related to this matter

  solaia technology llc for nearly five years we were a party in several suits in which one or both of solaia technology llc solaia and schneider automation inc schneider were adverse to us in 2001 solaia acquired us patent no 5038318 the ‘318 patent from schneider a competitor in the field of factory automation schneider retained certain interests in the ‘318 patent including a share in any licensing income solaia formed to license and enforce the ‘318 patent asserted that the patent covers computercontrolled factory automation systems used throughout most modern factories in the united states issued demand letters to a wide range of factory owners and operators and filed lawsuits for alleged infringement of the ‘318 patent 

among other lawsuits filed by solaia concerning the ‘318 patent solaia filed suit on july 2 2002 accusing sixteen companies of infringing the ‘318 patent solaia technology llc v arvinmeritor inc et al  02c4704 nd ill the chicago patent suit we believed that solaia’s claims in the chicago patent suit were without merit and baseless and in december 2002 we sought to protect our customers from solaia’s claims by bringing an action in federal court in milwaukee against solaia its law firm niro scavone haller  niro and schneider rockwell automation inc et al v schneider automation inc et al case no 02c1195 ed wis the milwaukee action on may 12 2003 solaia sued us directly in the chicago patent suit for patent infringement 

  in april 2006 following rulings in our favor on motions for summary judgment we entered into an agreement with solaia and its law firm that ended the chicago patent suit and provided that the various other lawsuits between us and solaia and its law firm would be dismissed separately in october 2006 we entered into a settlement agreement with schneider that ended the milwaukee action all lawsuits concerning the company and the ‘318 patent are now completely resolved 

  asbestos like thousands of other companies we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies the great bulk of the complaints however do not identify any of our products or specify which of these claimants if any were exposed to asbestos attributable to our products and past experience has shown that the vast majority of the claimants will never identify any of our products 

in addition when our products appear to be identified they are frequently from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of our products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants 

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for most of these claims we initiated litigation in the milwaukee county circuit court on february 12 2004 to enforce the insurance policies against nationwide indemnity company and kemper insurance the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to our former allenbradley subsidiary as a result the insurance carriers have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims subject to policy limits if either carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits of either carrier are exhausted our share of future defense and indemnity costs may increase however coverage under excess policies may be available to pay some or all of these costs 

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term solvency of our insurance companies make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  foreign corrupt practices act as a result of an internal review we determined during the fourth quarter of 2006 that actions by a small number of employees at certain of our operations in one jurisdiction may have violated the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or other applicable laws we and some of our distributors do business in this jurisdiction with government owned enterprises or government owned enterprises that are evolving to commercial businesses these actions involved payments for nonbusiness travel expenses and certain other business arrangements involving potentially improper payment mechanisms for legitimate business expenses special outside counsel has been engaged to investigate the actions and report to the audit committee their review is ongoing 

we voluntarily disclosed these actions to the us department of justice “doj” and the securities and exchange commission “sec” beginning in september 2006 we are implementing thorough remedial measures and are cooperating on these issues with the doj and sec we have agreed to update the doj and sec periodically regarding any further developments as the investigation continues 

if violations of the fcpa occurred we may be subject to consequences that could include fines penalties other costs and businessrelated impacts we could also face similar consequences from local authorities while we are not in a position to reasonably estimate potential consequences at this time we do not believe the consequences of this investigation the remediation or any related penalties or business related impacts have had or will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

  overview 

overall demand for our products and services is driven by 

 

  u s industrial economic trends 

in 2006 sales in the us accounted for more than 62 percent of our total sales the trend of improving conditions in the us manufacturing economy during 2004 and 2005 continued into the first half of 2006 and moderated somewhat in the second half the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served markets include 

 

  the table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in us industrial equipment spending and capacity utilization and the sustained strength in the pmi since december 2003 while we still expect moderate growth in 2007 we are planning for a deceleration to a more sustainable level of growth in the us economy in 2007 

 

note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 

  nonus regional trends 

outside the us demand is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers’ ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets these customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and growing indigenous companies recent strength in demand has in part been driven by investment in infrastructure in developing economies in basic materials production capacity in response to higherend product pricing and in expanding consumer markets we continue to see strong demand in china india and latin america we also saw considerable growth in europe during the second half of 2006 following nearly two years of little or no growth in 2006 our european operations benefited from our targeted growth investments in customerfacing resources as well as improving macroeconomic conditions we expect strong growth in latin america europe and the emerging economies in asia pacific will continue into 2007

    industry views 

we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products transportation basic materials and oil and gas during 2006 we benefited from growing demand in most of the industries we serve 

our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage home health and beauty and life sciences industries these customers’ needs include global expansion incremental capacity from existing facilities an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance in addition these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors as a result consumer products customers’ capital investments are generally less cyclical than those of heavy manufacturing customers 

in transportation factors such as plant closings customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales while our global automotive revenue was flat in 2006 our traditional north american automotive installed base experienced a significant slowdown during the second half of the year this had a negative impact on sales and operating earnings in our control systems business primarily on sales of our logix and plc products our plan for 2007 does not anticipate any recovery 

our customers in basic materials industries including mining aggregates metals forest products and cement all benefit from higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic materials both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries 

as energy prices rise customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity during 2006 high energy prices contributed to strong growth in resource and energy based industries 

in addition higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider investing in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor controls 

  outlook for 2007 

the following is a summary of key objectives for 2007 

 

our key objectives assume a certain amount of cost productivity in 2007 our cost productivity initiatives will likely include workforce reductions and facility rationalization these actions are consistent with the planned divestiture of most of our power systems operating segment and our globalization and cost productivity efforts costs associated with these actions will be recorded when the relevant recognition criteria have been met 

our outlook for 2007 is based on expected demand and assumes sustained momentum outside of north america with slower rates of growth in the us and canada than in the previous three years our outlook also assumes sustained momentum across most industrial end markets the actual growth reported in any particular quarter may out perform or lag that trend this oscillation of performance around a trend is attributed to the inherent variability in our business with short lead times and minimal backlog in our nonproject businesses extrapolation of growth rates or levels of profitability from any one quarter can lead to incorrect conclusions about future performance 

as of the date of filing this report based upon current economic conditions and business trends we expect to grow revenue in 2007 by 7 to 8 percent consistent with our longterm growth trend as of the date hereof we also expect full year 2007 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 370 to 390 this includes an expected effective income tax rate that will average about 32 percent for the full year excluding the effect of acquisitions divestitures or other items separately reported net of their related tax effects this tax rate assumes continued execution of our globalization strategy we also plan to generate free cash flow approximately equal to net income this guidance does not incorporate the impact of future acquisitions or divestures including the planned divestiture of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses

power systems sales increased 15 percent compared to 2005 with growth in both our dodge mechanical and reliance electrical business groups sales at power systems benefited from continued strong momentum resulting from high energy and commodity prices these higher prices resulted in the segment’s predominantly us based customers investing in capacity expansion after several years of underinvestment and reduced capital spending 

  operating earnings 

power systems operating earnings grew 47 percent due to higher volume productivity initiatives a balanced dynamic between price and cost and lower restructuring costs somewhat offset by inflation segment operating earnings in 2006 include stock compensation expense of 40 million and increased pension and retiree medical expense of 58 million compared to 2005 segment operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of 50 million associated with a facility closure and the corresponding writedown of property to its fair value 

    2005 compared to 2004 

 

  sales 

sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004 driven by double digit growth at both control systems and power systems two percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates primarily resulting from the strength of the major european currencies and the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar sales rose by double digit percentages in all regions except for emea where difficult economic conditions dampened growth in the major economies of western europe primarily france germany and the uk the emerging economies in asiapacific led by china and india experienced particularly strong growth strength of the oil and gas and mining industries in latin america and oil and gas industry in canada contributed to particularly strong sales growth in those regions 

sales in the global waterwastewater oil and gas aggregate and cement and mining industries grew at a rate higher than our annual growth rate of 13 percent sales in the food and transportation industries grew at rates approximate to our annual growth rate while sales in life sciences semiconductor and beverage grew at a rate less than our annual growth rate 

  segment operating earnings 

segment operating earnings benefited from higher volume productivity programs and favorable pricing offset slightly by inflation in comparison to the prior year additionally segment operating earnings in 2005 include 215 million related to special charges associated with restructuring activities in europe and a us plant closing offset by 123 million of benefits received related to insurance settlements segment operating earnings in 2004 include 263 million for special facilities related charges 

  general corporate — net 

general corporate expenses were 697 million in 2005 compared to 883 million in 2004 expense decreased primarily due to reduced environmental costs lower contributions to our charitable corporation and increased interest income 

  interest expense 

interest expense was 458 million in 2005 compared to 417 million in 2004 primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap see note 6 in the financial statements 

  income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 297 percent in 2005 and 192 percent in 2004 the effective tax rate for 2005 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent due to a benefit of 197 million 010 per diluted share related to the settlement of audit matters with the us internal revenue service for the years 1998 through 2002 utilization of foreign tax credits fsc and eti tax benefits and other provision adjustments 

the effective tax rate for 2004 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent due to benefits totaling 463 million 024 per diluted share from the resolution of various tax matters in nonus jurisdictions state tax benefits involving refund claims lower nonus tax rates fsc and eti tax benefits and other provision adjustments 

see note 16 in the financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and additional information on tax events in 2005 and 2004 affecting the respective tax rates

    control systems 

 

  sales 

control systems sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004 three percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates primarily resulting from the relative strength of the major european currencies and the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar sales of our logix offering grew by more than 26 percent compared to 2004 which was somewhat offset by a decline in our legacy control platform products that are being replaced by logix growth in sales of our logix offering was driven by our introduction of new functionality and an expanded addressable market our intelligent motor control products also delivered significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to extractionbased and heavy industrial customers higher commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency programs led to the strong demand from these customers 

  operating earnings 

segment operating earnings increased by 43 percent compared to 2004 the increase in segment operating earnings is due to higher volume cost productivity and favorable pricing that was somewhat offset by inflation control systems 2005 results include 123 million of benefits related to insurance settlements offset by 165 million of special charges associated with realignment of administrative functions and a reduction in workforce in europe prior year segment operating earnings include a 263 million charge related to a facilities rationalization program 

  power systems 

 

  sales 

power systems sales increased 17 percent compared to 2004 with growth in both our dodge mechanical and reliance electrical business groups growth was driven by demand from the powercentric customers in heavy extractionbased industries such as mining and oil and gas higher commodity prices are causing the segment’s predominantly us based customers to invest in capacity expansion after several years of underinvestment and reduced capital spending 

  operating earnings 

power systems operating earnings grew 63 percent due to higher volume favorable pricing and productivity somewhat offset by inflation and significantly higher material costs segment operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of 50 million associated with a facility closure and the corresponding writedown of property to its fair value compared to 40 million of charges related to restructuring activities in 2004 

  financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions 

 

our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy in the first quarter of 2006 we adopted sfas 123r see note 1 in the financial statements which requires that we report excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow we have added this benefit back to our operating cash flow to present free cash flow on a basis that is consistent with our historical presentation in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 

free cash flow was 3235 million for the year ended september 30 2006 compared to 5148 million for the year ended september 30 2005 free cash flow in 2006 includes voluntary contributions to our us pension plan of 4500 million compared to 1500 million of such contributions in 2005 in addition increased capital spending and working capital in 2006 resulted from the operating growth and growth investments that occurred during the year 

commercial paper is our principal source of shortterm financing commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september 30 2006 were 2190 million the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 54 percent at september 30 2005 and throughout 2005 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding due to our cash position 

in october 2005 we contributed 450 million to our us qualified pension trust we funded the contribution with a combination of cash on hand and 300 million of commercial paper borrowings in november 2005 we sold 24 owned properties in a saleleaseback transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately 1475 million we used the cash proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings in september of 2006 we received 834 million of cash from the sale of our investment in rsc 

in 2006 we repurchased approximately 122 million shares of our common stock of which 04 million shares did not settle until october 2006 the total cost of these shares was 7431 million of which 206 million was recorded in accounts payable at september 30 2006 we repurchased 98 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 4992 million in 2005 we anticipate repurchasing stock in 2007 the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions stock price and other cash requirements at september 30 2006 we had authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to approximately 56 million additional shares through september 30 2007 

on november 7 2006 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to divest the principal businesses included in our power systems operating segment for 18 billion comprised of 175 billion in cash and 50 million in common stock of the acquirer the divestiture is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to close in our second fiscal quarter we expect to use a significant portion of the aftertax cash proceeds to repurchase common stock to pay down outstanding commercial paper balances or to pursue growth opportunities 

  we expect future significant uses of cash to include repurchases of common stock repayments of shortterm borrowings dividends to shareowners capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans we expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be about 175 million we expect to fund each of these future uses of cash with existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings divestures of businesses a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities 

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototalcapital ratio was 335 percent at september 30 2006 and 312 percent at september 30 2005 

in october 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing 6750 million unsecured credit facilities in september 2006 we entered into a 364day 2500 million unsecured revolving credit facility both credit facilities remain in effect and we had not drawn down under either of them at september 30 2006 or 2005 borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debttototalcapital ratio was to exceed 60 percent we were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at september 30 2006 and 2005 in addition to our 6000 million and 2500 million credit facilities shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 1252 million at september 30 2006 were available to foreign subsidiaries 

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2006 

 

among other uses we can draw our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facilities if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

cash dividends to shareowners were 1593 million 090 per share in 2006 and 1427 million 078 per share in 2005 although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors we expect to pay quarterly dividends in 2007 of 029 per outstanding share 

certain of our contractual cash obligations at september 30 2006 are 

 

 

 we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees see note 12 in the financial statements for information regarding these plans and expected future cash outflows related to the plans 

  supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore changes in currency rates affect our reported sales we believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates we use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

    retirement benefits 

  pension benefits 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate the retirement rate the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods 

our global pension expense in 2006 was 836 million compared to 662 million in 2005 approximately 70 percent of our 2006 global pension expense relates to our us qualified pension plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2006 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 525 percent compared to 625 percent for 2005 expected rate of return on plan assets of 850 percent compared to 850 percent for 2005 and an assumed compensation increase rate of 406 percent compared to 450 percent for 2005 

in 2006 we made voluntary contributions of 4500 million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to 1500 million in 2005 

the pension protection act of 2006 was signed into law in august 2006 we are currently evaluating this legislation and the effect it will have on our future pension contributions 

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately 46 million in 2007 a decrease of approximately 37 million from 2006 our estimated 2007 pension expense reflects the net cost related to changes in actuarial assumptions in the us pension plan and the benefit of the 4500 million contribution in october 2005 

for 2007 changes in actuarial assumptions include an increase in our discount rate to 650 percent from the 525 percent rate used in 2006 the discount rate is set as of our june 30 th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans our assumed rate of return on plan assets will be reduced to 800 percent compared to the 850 percent assumed rate of return used in 2006 we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption we intend over time to change the us plan’s mix of investments by increasing the weighting in debt securities we have assumed a compensation increase rate of 419 percent in 2007 compared to 406 percent used in 2006 we established this rate using an analysis of all elements of employee compensation that are considered pension eligible earnings 

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for our us pension plans in millions 

 

additional information regarding pension benefits including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

  other postretirement benefits 

we estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions including the discount rate and for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program expected trends in the cost for healthcare services changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods the discount rate used to calculate our 2006 other postretirement benefits expense was 500 percent compared to 625 percent in 2005 for 2007 the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will increase to 650 percent the discount rate is set as of our june 30 th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 

  effective october 1 2002 we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services as a result of this amendment to our primary us program there is no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of january 1 2005 

net periodic benefit cost in 2006 was 354 million compared to 249 million in 2005 we expect net periodic benefit cost in 2007 of approximately 13 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate 255 million the decreases are due primarily to the increase in the discount rate by 150 basis points to 650 percent and our transition of all eligible retirees to a more efficient medicare advantage plan 

additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

  revenue recognition 

we record sales of products and services representing approximately 90 percent of our consolidated sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered 

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii unitsofdelivery under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

  returns rebates and incentives 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations 

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 60 million 

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1218 million at september 30 2006 and 1176 million at september 30 2005 of which 85 million at september 30 2006 and 94 million at september 30 2005 was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

    impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired we use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results a significant decrease in the market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends 

impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value to determine fair value we must make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed these estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services future market conditions and technological developments other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates 

we perform our annual impairment test on nonamortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year as of the second quarter of 2006 the estimated fair value of our reliance trademark exceeded its 728 million net book value either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of our electrical business group could result in an impairment charge to write down the book value of the reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value 

  litigation claims and contingencies 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 

effective september 30 2006 we adopted fin 47 which clarifies the guidance included in sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 143 under fin 47 companies must accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that results from the acquisition construction development or the normal operation of the longlived asset the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional 

identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities we estimated conditional asset retirement obligations using sitespecific knowledge and historical industry expertise the application of fin 47 resulted in a charge net of tax of 181 million included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september 30 2006 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

our reserve for environmental matters net of related receivables was 666 million at september 30 2006 and 393 million at september 30 2005 the reserve in 2006 includes 293 million recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2006 resulting from our adoption of fin 47 see note 17 in the financial statements for additional information during 2006 we recorded adjustments totaling 52 million excluding the adoption of fin 47 to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared to 2005 adjustments of 85 million 

  our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability as described in item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see item 3 for further discussion 

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims excluding asbestos using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 297 million at september 30 2006 and 295 million at september 30 2005 

additional information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 17 in the financial statements 

  income taxes 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 

while we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures we regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties if any according to the principles of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  we have recorded an accrual of 851 million at september 30 2006 and 1031 million at september 30 2005 that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit 

we have recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets in the amount of 368 million at september 30 2006 and 555 million at september 30 2005 related to nonus net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforward amount will be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more carryforwards than currently expected 

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate a base effective tax rate which is the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a yeartodate basis excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects we recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they are realizable

 item 7a 

  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings at september 30 2006 we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 2190 million at a weighted average interest rate of 54 percent we had no commercial paper or significant bank borrowings outstanding at september 30 2005 or during 2005 the weighted average interest rate on the 2006 commercial paper borrowings was 48 percent changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations in 2006 and 2005 a 10 percent increase in average market interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations 

at september 30 2006 we had 2190 million of unsecured commercial paper obligations outstanding with maturities of three days as these obligations mature we issued and anticipate continuing to issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 7482 million at september 30 2006 and 7482 million at september 30 2005 the fair value of this debt was 8042 million at september 30 2006 and 8262 million at september 30 2005 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity 

in september 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 615 notes payable in 2008 to floating rate debt based on sixmonth libor the floating rate was 802 percent at september 30 2006 a hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency in addition we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately 

at september 30 2006 and 2005 we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro british pound sterling south korean won and swiss franc the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

  the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net transactional foreign exchange exposure related to short long contracts outstanding by currency 

 

all of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future we designated certain of these contracts related to intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through november 2009 as cash flow hedges under sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our consolidated balance sheet

control systems is our largest operating segment with 2005 sales of 41 billion 82 percent of our total sales and approximately 17000 employees at september 30 2005 control systems supplies industrial automation products systems software and services focused on helping customers control and improve manufacturing processes the operating segment includes two main business groups the components and packaged applications group cpag and the automation control and information group acig

cpag supplies industrial components power control and motor management products and packaged and engineered products and systems cpag’s sales account for approximately 40 percent of control systems’ sales

acig’s core products are used primarily to control and monitor industrial plants and processes and typically consist of a processor software and inputoutput i o devices acig’s integrated architecture and logix controllers perform multiple types of control applications including discrete batch continuous process drive system motion and machine safety across various factory floor operations acig’s sales account for approximately 45 percent of control systems’ sales

in addition control systems’ offering also includes services and solutions such as multivendor customer support training automation systems integration asset management and manufacturing information solutions for discrete and targeted batch process industries control systems’ service and solution offerings compete with emerson electric co general electric company invensys siemens ag and other system integrators

the following is a summary of the major products and services and major competitors of control systems’ two main business groups

 

depending on the product or service involved control systems’ competitors range from large diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation to smaller companies specializing in niche products and services factors that influence control systems’ competitive position are its broad product portfolio and scope of solutions technology leadership knowledge of customer applications large installed base established distribution network quality of products and services price and global presence

control systems’ products are marketed primarily under the allenbradley and rockwell software brand names major markets served include consumer products transportation oil and gas mining metals and forest products

in north america control systems’ products are sold primarily through independent distributors that typically do not carry products that compete with allenbradley products large systems and service offerings are sold principally through a direct sales force though opportunities are sometimes sourced through distributors or system integrators product sales outside the united states occur through a combination of direct sales sales through distributors and sales through system integrators

in 2005 sales in the united states accounted for 56 percent of control systems’ sales outside the us control systems’ primary markets were canada china the united kingdom germany italy mexico australia and korea

control systems is headquartered in milwaukee wisconsin and has operations in north america europe asiapacific and latin america

the following is a summary of the major products and services and major competitors of the power systems operating segment

 

depending on the product involved power systems’ competitors range from large diversified businesses that sell products outside of industrial automation to smaller companies specializing in niche products and services factors that influence power systems’ competitive position are product quality installed base price and our established distributor network while power systems’ competitive position is strong in north america it is limited somewhat by its small presence outside the united states

mechanical’s products are marketed primarily under the dodge brand name while electrical’s products are marketed primarily under the reliance electric brand name major markets served include mining cement aggregates environmental forest products foodbeverage oil and gas metals and material handling

mechanical’s products are sold primarily through distributors while electrical’s products are sold primarily through a direct sales force

in 2005 sales in the united states accounted for 62 percent of our total sales our principal markets outside the united states are in canada china the united kingdom germany italy mexico australia and korea see risk factors below for a discussion of risks associated with our operations outside of the united states

sales and property information by major geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended september 30 2005 is contained in note 18 in the financial statements

5 research and development 

our research and development spending is in millions

 

customersponsored research and development was not significant in 2005 2004 or 2003

employees 

at september 30 2005 we had approximately 21000 employees approximately 14000 were employed in the united states and of these employees about 7 percent were represented by various local or national unions

raw materials and supplies 

we purchase many items of equipment components and materials used in the production of our products from others the raw materials essential to the conduct of each of our business segments generally are available at competitive prices although we have a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors we depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules see risk factors below for a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers

backlog 

our total order backlog was 7725 million at september 30 2005 and 5004 million at september 30 2004 backlog is not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods due to the shortcycle nature of most of our sales activities

environmental protection requirements 

information about the effect on the company and its manufacturing operations of compliance with environmental protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims is contained in note 17 in the financial statements see also item 3 legal proceedings 

patents licenses and trademarks 

we own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and operations various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have been made to us we believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition see item 3 legal proceedings while in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the operation of our business we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition see risk factors below for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property

the company’s name and its registered trademark “rockwell automation” is important to each of our business segments in addition we own other important trademarks we use for certain products and services such as “allenbradley” and “ab” for electronic controls and systems for industrial automation “reliance” and “reliance electric” for electric motors and drives and “dodge” for mechanical power transmission products

6 seasonality 

our business segments are not subject to significant seasonality

risk factors 

 

approximately 38 percent of our revenues in 2005 were outside of the us future growth rates and success of our business depend in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include changes in political economic and social environments local labor conditions changes in laws regulations and policies of foreign governments as well as us laws affecting activities of us companies abroad including tax laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in addition we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to transfer to the us in a taxefficient manner

 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve developing new products requires high levels of innovation and the development process is often lengthy and costly if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected

 

demand for our products is sensitive to changes in levels of global industrial production as economic activity slows down companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending resulting in decreased demand for our products if this occurs our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected

 

we depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives if we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure such as a computer virus a problem with the functioning of an important it application or an intentional disruption of our it systems by a third party the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns

we are in the process of introducing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that will redesign and deploy new processes organization structures and a common information system over a period of several years as we implement the erp system the new system may not perform as expected this could have an adverse effect on our business

 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability

 

risks inherent in the sale of systems and solutions include assuming greater responsibility for project completion and success defining and controlling contract scope efficient execution of projects and the efficiency and quality of our subcontractors our inability to control manage and mitigate these risks could adversely affect our results of operations

 

natural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts and the actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause damage or disrupt our business operations our suppliers or our customers and could create political or economic instability any of which could have an adverse effect on our business although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences these events could decrease demand for our products could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products or could disrupt our supply chain

 

we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to our business the loss of patents or licenses used in principal portions of our business may have an adverse effect on our results of operations expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant in addition others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we sometimes provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties indemnification payments and legal costs to defend claims could have an adverse effect on our business

 

legislators and agencies of the us government have proposed legislation and regulations to amend restrict or eliminate various features of and mandate additional funding of pension benefit plans if legislation or new regulations are adopted we may be required to contribute additional cash to these plans in excess of our current estimates market volatility in interest rates investment returns and other factors could also adversely affect the funded status of our pension plans moreover future changes to the accounting and reporting standards related to pension plans could create significant volatility in our operating results

 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses in prior years we retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds for periods before the divestitures as a result from time to time we may be required to make payments related to tax matters associated with those divested businesses

 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and 

8 administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results

 

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability safety and health employment and contract matters we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago the uncertainties of litigation including asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance coverage make it difficult to accurately predict the ultimate resolution thereof

 

our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to regulation by various environmental regulatory authorities concerned with the impact of the environment on human health the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air ground and waters the quality of air and bodies of water and the handling use and disposal of specified substances environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change our financial responsibility for the cleanup or other remediation of contaminated property or for natural resource damages can extend to previously owned or used properties waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals as well as properties currently owned and used by us regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners

we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be in the future as well and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant

 

we have acquired and anticipate continuing to acquire businesses in an effort to enhance shareowner value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties including

 

future acquisitions could cause us to incur additional debt dilution contingent liabilities increased interest expense and amortization expenses related to intangible assets impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges could also occur as a result of acquisitions

 

in north america approximately 75 percent of our sales are through a limited number of third party distributors while we maintain the right to appoint new distributors any unplanned disruption to the existing channel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a disruption could be caused by the sale of a distributor to a competitor financial instability of the distributor or other unforeseen events

 

our manufacturing processes require that we purchase a high volume of equipment components and materials from third party suppliers our reliance on these suppliers involves certain risks including

 

any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete we also maintain several singlesource supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance quality support delivery capacity or price considerations unavailability or delivery delays of singlesource components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products even where alternative sources of supply are available qualifying the alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a possible loss of revenues

  solaia technology llc we are a party in several suits in which solaia technology llc solaia is adverse solaia is a singlepurpose entity formed to license us patent no 5038318 the ’318 patent solaia acquired the ’318 patent from schneider automation inc a competitor of ours in the field of factory automation schneider has retained certain interests in the ’318 patent including a share in solaia’s licensing income solaia has asserted that the ’318 patent covers computer controlled factory automation systems used throughout most modern factories in the united states

solaia has issued hundreds of demand letters to a wide range of factory owners and operators and has filed a series of lawsuits against over 40 companies alleging patent infringement a significant number of the companies sued by solaia have chosen to settle the claims for amounts that we believe are notably smaller than the likely legal costs of successfully defending solaia’s claims in court recently solaia has dismissed its lawsuits against several of the companies that chose not to settle

in a suit filed by solaia on july 2 2002 in chicago solaia technology llc v arvinmeritor inc et al 02c4704 nd ill chicago patent suit solaia accused sixteen companies of infringing the ’318 patent we made arrangements with arvinmeritor which owns and operates our former automotive business to undertake arvinmeritor’s defense of solaia’s patent claims to seek to assure that solaia’s infringement claim against arvinmeritor could be finally and actually adjudicated in the chicago patent suit in that case solaia responded on may 12 2003 by suing us directly for direct patent infringement demanding material monetary damages we believe that solaia’s claim against us in the chicago patent suit is wholly without merit and baseless on march 28 2005 the court granted arvinmeritor’s motion for summary judgment that the accused arvinmeritor systems did not infringe the ’318 patent on the same date the court denied solaia’s motion for summary judgment that the accused rockwell systems infringed the ’318 patent additional summary judgment motions in which we seek dismissal of solaia’s claims against us remain pending

in january 2003 solaia filed a lawsuit in federal court in chicago against us and several others solaia technology llc v rockwell automation inc et al case no 03c566 nd ill alleging federal antitrust and unfair competition violations tortious interference defamation and other claims we deny any liability under those claims solaia’s antitrust and tort case has now been transferred to the federal court in milwaukee case no 03c939 ed wis and effectively consolidated with the milwaukee action and all proceedings in milwaukee have been administratively stayed

in december 2003 solaia filed a state court action in cook county illinois alleging tortious interference claims against us and one of our former officers this action was removed from state court and as with 

12 solaia’s january 2003 suit has been transferred to the federal court in milwaukee case no 04c368 ed wis

all of the milwaukee cases are in their earliest stages the federal court in milwaukee has stayed all three cases in milwaukee pending developments in the chicago patent suit

  asbestos like thousands of other companies we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants together with hundreds of other companies the great bulk of the complaints however do not identify any of our products or specify which of these claimants if any were exposed to asbestos attributable to our products and past experience has shown that the vast majority of the claimants will never identify any of our products in addition when our products appear to be identified they are frequently from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the integrity of our products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants

we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for most of these claims we initiated litigation in the milwaukee county circuit court on february 12 2004 to enforce the insurance policies against nationwide indemnity company and kemper insurance the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to our former allenbradley subsidiary as a result the insurance carriers have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for allenbradley asbestos claims subject to policy limits if either carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits of either carrier are exhausted our share of future defense and indemnity costs may increase however coverage under excess policies may be available to pay some or all of these costs

the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term solvency of our insurance companies make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

  other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

overall demand for our products is driven by

 

 

in 2005 sales in the us accounted for more than 60 percent of our total sales the trend of improving conditions experienced in the us manufacturing economy during 2004 continued into 2005 as reflected in the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served markets these indicators include

 18 

the table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in us industrial equipment spending expressed in billions of usd capacity utilization expressed as a percentage and the continued expansion in manufacturing activity as indicated by the pmi expressed as defined above since december 2002

 note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations

 

outside the us demand is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers’ ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets these customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and growing indigenous companies recent strength in demand has in part been driven by investment in infrastructure in developing economies in basic materials production capacity in response to higherend product pricing and in expanding consumer markets

the table below presents our actual sales for the year ended september 30 2005 by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended september 30 2004 in millions except percentages

  

 

 

we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products transportation basic materials and oil and gas during 2005 we benefited from growing demand in most of the industries we serve

our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage brewing consumer packaged goods and life sciences industries as automation is key to their ability to differentiate their product offerings their investment is generally less cyclical than heavy manufacturing customers

factors such as customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales to transportation customers

our customers in basic materials industries including mining aggregates metals forest products and cement all benefit from higher commodities prices and higher global demand for basic materials both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries

as energy prices rise customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity in addition higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider new investment in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies such as intelligent motor controls

 

the following is a summary of our objectives for 2006

 

our outlook for 2006 assumes that the economic environment will remain favorable and that a continuing industrial recovery will result in growth during 2006 while we expect demand for our products to benefit from this trend we also assume that our growth will vary and may exceed or lag trend levels in any given quarter

as of the date of filing this report based upon current economic activities and business trends we expect to grow revenue in 2006 by 7 to 9 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as of the date hereof we also expect full year 2006 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 300 to 310 and plan to generate free cash flow of approximately 280 million after giving effect to our 450 million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension trust in october 2005

   

 

  

sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004 driven by double digit growth at both control systems and power systems two percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates primarily resulting from the strength of the major european currencies and the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar sales rose by double digit percentages in all regions except for emea where difficult economic conditions dampened growth in the major economies of western europe primarily france germany and the uk the emerging economies in asiapacific led by china and india experienced particularly strong growth strength of the oil and gas and mining industries in latin america and oil and gas industry in canada contributed to particularly strong sales growth in those regions

sales in the global water wastewater oil and gas aggregate and cement and mining industries grew at a rate higher than our annual growth rate of 13 percent sales in the food and transportation industries grew at rates approximate to our annual growth rate while sales in life sciences semiconductor and beverage grew at a rate less than our annual growth rate

income from continuing operations benefited from higher volume productivity programs and favorable pricing offset slightly by inflation in comparison to the prior year additionally income from continuing operations in 2005 includes 197 million 010 per share of tax benefits related to the resolution of claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure of the 1998 through 2002 federal audit and 84 million aftertax 004 per share of benefits related to insurance settlements offset by 142 million aftertax 008 per share related to special charges associated with restructuring activities in europe and a us plant closing income from continuing operations in 2004 includes 463 million 024 per share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters and state tax refunds offset by 163 million aftertax 009 per share of special facilities related charges

control systems 

 

control systems sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004 three percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates primarily resulting from the relative strength of the major european currencies and the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar sales of our logix offering grew by more than 26 percent compared to 2004 which was somewhat offset by a decline in our legacy control platform products that are being replaced by logix growth in sales of our logix offering was driven by our introduction of new functionality and an expanded addressable market our intelligent motor control products also delivered significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to extractionbased and heavy industrial customers higher commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency programs led to the strong demand from these customers

segment operating earnings increased by 43 percent compared to 2004 the increase in segment operating earnings is due to higher volume cost productivity and favorable pricing that was somewhat offset by inflation control systems 2005 results include 123 million pretax of benefits related to insurance settlements offset by 165 million pretax of special charges associated with realignment of administrative functions and a reduction in workforce in europe prior year segment operating earnings includes a 263 million pretax charge related to a facilities rationalization program

power systems 

 

power systems sales increased 17 percent compared to 2004 with growth in both our dodge mechanical and reliance electrical business groups growth was driven by demand from the powercentric customers in heavy extractionbased industries such as mining and oil and gas higher commodity prices are causing the segment’s predominantly us based customers to invest in capacity expansion after several years of underinvestment and reduced capital spending

power systems operating earnings grew 63 percent due to higher volume favorable pricing and productivity somewhat offset by inflation and significantly higher material costs segment operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of 50 million pretax associated with a facility closure and the corresponding writedown of property to its fair value compared to 40 million pretax of charges related to restructuring activities in 2004

 

general corporate expenses were 697 million in 2005 compared to 883 million in 2004 expense dropped primarily due to decreased environmental costs lower contributions to our charitable corporation and increased interest income

 

interest expense was 458 million in 2005 compared to 417 million in 2004 primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap see note 6 in the financial statements

2004 compared to 2003 

 

sales increased 10 percent compared to 2003 driven by growth at both control systems and power systems three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates

income from continuing operations in 2004 included 463 million 024 per share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters as well as the benefit of state tax refunds the 2003 results included a tax benefit of 694 million 037 per share related to the settlement of a us federal research and experimentation credit refund claim

control systems 

 

control systems sales increased 11 percent compared to 2003 four percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the us dollar sales outside of the us increased 15 percent 6 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and us sales increased 8 percent

control systems experienced sales growth in all regions with exceptional strength in the emerging economies of asia and latin america where we continued to increase market penetration sales growth was primarily driven by maintenance related and smaller productivity related projects these projects were the result of pentup demand after the period of underinvestment in productive assets during 2002 and 2003 in addition to these investments we experienced an increase in activity related to larger scale projects in the second half of fiscal year 2004 these larger projects were driven by our customers’ requirements for incremental productivity improvements and capacity optimization

our logix platform business continued its strong growth with an increase of 30 percent over 2003 industrial components and adjustable speed drives experienced doubledigit growth as well these gains were partially offset by moderate declines in drive systems and legacy control platforms

segment operating margins increased due to higher volume favorable product mix and productivity improvements volume leverage improved during the year due to our continuing productivity efforts and ongoing facility rationalization programs

23 power systems 

 

power systems sales increased 7 percent compared to 2003 the mechanical and electrical business groups contributed about equally to the growth the sales increase was mainly the result of volume strength in the second half of 2004 higher global demand for basic materials and subsequent higher prices for these materials encouraged significant investment in capacity optimization and productivity and drove our sales

significant cost and productivity initiatives launched in the second quarter of 2004 financial leverage on incremental volume and price increases more than offset rising raw material prices resulting in the improved segment operating margin

 

general corporate expenses were 883 million in 2004 compared to 668 million in 2003 expense in 2004 includes charges of 164 million due to higher estimated costs for environmental remediation at several legacy sites 70 million of contributions to our charitable corporation and 50 million of costs associated with corporate staff changes expense in 2003 included a charge of 47 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at a legacy site

 

in the second quarter of 2003 we sold a majority of our ownership interest in reliance electric limited japan rej resulting in a loss of 84 million 25 million after tax or 001 per diluted share the cash proceeds from the transaction totaled 104 million

 

interest expense was 417 million in 2004 compared to 525 million in 2003 the decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the 1500 million principal amount of 680 notes in april 2003 the benefit of an interest rate swap see note 6 in the financial statements and lower average shortterm borrowings

 

see note 13 and note 16 in the financial statements for information regarding discontinued operations

 

during 2005 we recognized tax benefits of 197 million 010 per diluted share related to the resolution of claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure of the federal audit cycle for the years 1998 through 2002

in 2004 we recognized tax benefits of 463 million 024 per diluted share related to the following items

 24 

during 2003 we recognized a net tax benefit of 694 million 037 per diluted share related to a us federal research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax benefit of approximately 26 million as a result of our ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been previously provided

the full year effective tax rate for 2005 was 297 percent as compared to 192 percent for 2004 the discrete items described above decreased the effective tax rate by 26 percent in 2005 and 105 percent in 2004 the full year effective tax rate for 2003 was 54 percent including the effect of the research and experimentation settlement 233 percent benefit and the utilization of capital loss carryforwards 09 percent benefit

see note 16 in the financial statements for a reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate

current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions has resulted and may continue to result in an increasing effective tax rate over time we expect that the effective income tax rate in 2006 will be approximately 335 percent excluding the income tax expense or benefit related to discrete items if any that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects

see note 13 and note 16 in the financial statements for information on tax matters related to discontinued operations

financial condition 

the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions

 

our definition of free cash flow which is a nongaap financial measure takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies

free cash flow was 5148 million for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to 4989 million for the year ended september 30 2004 increased pretax earnings more than offset the increase in voluntary contributions to our us pension plan 1500 million in 2005 compared to 1250 million in 2004 capital spending and working capital needs the increased capital spending includes investments in information technology and certain longlived asset replacements

when necessary we utilize commercial paper as our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2005 and 2004 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during 2005 we had no commercial paper borrowings and during 2004 we did not have significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash position

in january 2004 we repaid our 84 million of industrial development revenue bonds prior to maturity using cash on hand in april 2003 we repaid our 1500 million principal amount of 680 notes at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings

in 2005 we repurchased approximately 98 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 4992 million compared to repurchases of approximately 75 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 2584 million in 2004 we anticipate repurchasing stock in 2006 the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions stock price and other cash requirements at september 30 2005 we had authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to approximately 88 million additional shares through september 30 2006

in october 2005 we contributed 450 million to our us qualified pension trust the contribution was funded with a combination of cash on hand and 300 million of commercial paper borrowings in november 2005 we sold 24 owned properties in a saleleaseback transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately 148 million the cash proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings

we expect future significant uses of cash to include capital expenditures dividends to shareowners repayments of shortterm borrowings acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common stock and may include additional contributions to our pension plans we expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be about 150 million we expect that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities

in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototal capital ratio was 312 percent at september 30 2005 and 289 percent at september 30 2004

in october 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing 6750 million unsecured credit facilities borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding the terms of our credit facility contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our debttototal capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent in addition to our 6000 million credit facility shortterm unsecured credit facilities of approximately 115 million at september 30 2005 were available to foreign subsidiaries

the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2005

 

moody’s changed its longterm outlook from negative to stable during the second quarter of 2005 to reflect our leading position in the global industrial automation market our healthy balance sheet and solid cash flow generation

among other things we can draw our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures

if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings

cash dividends to shareowners were 1427 million 078 per share in 2005 and 1225 million 066 per share in 2004 although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2006 of 0225 per outstanding share

certain of our contractual cash obligations at september 30 2005 are

  

   we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees see note 12 in the financial statements for information regarding these plans and expected future cash outflows related to the plans

at september 30 2005 we and rockwell collins each guarantee onehalf of a lease agreement for one of rockwell scientific company llc’s rsc facilities the total future minimum payments under the lease are 48 million the lease agreement has a term that ends in december 2011 in addition we share equally with rockwell collins in providing a 60 million line of credit to rsc which bears interest at the greater of our or rockwell collins’ commercial paper borrowing rate at september 30 2005 and 2004 there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit

supplemental sales information 

we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates which are outside of our control we believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates we use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of origin

the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions

 

the following is a reconciliation of reported sales of our control systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management

 

 

pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts including the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets the assumed annual compensation increase rate retirement rate mortality rate and employee turnover rate changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods

our global pension expense in 2005 was 662 million compared to 688 million in 2004 approximately 80 percent of our 2005 global pension expense relates to our us qualified pension plan the actuarial 

28 assumptions used to determine our 2005 us pension expense included the following discount rate of 625 percent compared to 600 percent for 2004 expected rate of return on plan assets of 850 percent compared to 850 percent for 2004 and an assumed compensation increase rate of 450 percent compared to 450 percent for 2004 

in 2005 we made voluntary contributions of 1500 million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to 1250 million in 2004

we estimate our pension expense will be approximately 82 million in 2006 an increase of approximately 16 million over 2005 our estimated 2006 pension expense reflects the following changes in the us pension plan

 

for 2006 changes in actuarial assumptions include a 100 basis point reduction in our discount rate to 525 percent from the 625 percent used in 2005 the discount rate is set as of our june 30th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans our assumed rate of return on plan assets will remain at 850 percent consistent with 2005 we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption we have assumed a compensation increase rate of 406 percent in 2006 compared to 450 percent used in 2005 we established this rate using an analysis of all elements of employee compensation that are considered pension eligible earnings additionally in establishing our 2006 pension assumptions we performed an actuarial experience study that changed other assumptions including retirement rate employee turnover rate and mortality rate as a result of utilizing the rp2000 table projected forward 10 years

effective for 2006 we amended our us pension plan to eliminate the early retirement subsidy for certain employees the effect of the amendment is a reduction of approximately 70 million in our pension benefit obligation and a corresponding reduction in annual pension expense recognized over the average remaining service life of plan participants

the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for our us pension plans in millions

 

additional information regarding pension benefits including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment is contained in note 12 in the financial statements

 

we estimate with the assistance of third party actuarial consultants the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions including the discount rate and for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program expected trends in the cost for healthcare services changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods the discount rate used to calculate our 2005 other postretirement benefits expense was 625 percent compared to 600 percent in 

29 2004 for 2006 the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to 50 percent 

effective october 1 2002 we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services as a result of this amendment to our primary us program there is no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of january 1 2005

net periodic benefit cost in 2005 was 249 million compared to 234 million in 2004

we expect net periodic benefit cost in 2006 of approximately 36 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate 425 million the expected increases are primarily due to the decrease in discount rate as of our june 30 2005 measurement date by 125 basis points to 50 percent

additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements

 

we record sales of products and services representing approximately 90 of our consolidated sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists pricing is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred as may be required according to contract terms or services have been rendered

we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales on constructiontype contracts using either the percentageofcompletion or completed contract methods of accounting we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method when we determine that progress towards completion is reasonably and reliably estimable we use the completed contract method for all others under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii unitsofdelivery under the percentageofcompletion method we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified

we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history

 

our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria certain distributors are offered a right to return product subject to contractual limitations

we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 50 million

returns rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or where a right of setoff exists as a reduction of accounts receivable the accrual for customer returns rebates and incentives was 1176 million at september 30 2005 and 861 million at september 30 2004 of which 94 million at september 30 2005 and 78 million at september 30 2004 was included as an offset to accounts receivable

 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired we use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results a significant decrease in the market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends

impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value to determine fair value we must make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed these estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services future market conditions and technological developments other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates

we perform our annual impairment test on nonamortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year as of the second quarter of 2005 the estimated fair value of our reliance trademark exceeded its 728 million net book value we calculated the estimated fair value with the assistance of third party valuation specialists either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of our electrical reliance business group could result in an impairment charge to write down the book value of the reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value

 

we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change

the reserve for environmental matters net of related receivables was 393 million at september 30 2005 and 388 million at september 30 2004 during 2005 we recorded adjustments totaling 85 million to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared to 2004 adjustments of 169 million

our recorded liability for environmental matters almost entirely relates to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to

31 earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations

various lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability as described in item 3 legal proceedings we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see item 3 for further discussion

our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability where we are selfinsured up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers we estimate the reserve for product liability claims excluding asbestos with the assistance of a third party actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims the reserve for product liability claims was 295 million at september 30 2005 and 323 million at september 30 2004

additional information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 17 in the financial statements

 

we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods additionally we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments

while we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures we regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties if any according to the principles of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies we have recorded an accrual of 1031 million at september 30 2005 that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits and is recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit

we have recorded a valuation allowance of 555 million at september 30 2005 for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards carryforwards based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the carryforwards that are expected to be realized our income would increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more carryforwards than currently expected

at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned as well as tax planning strategies current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions has resulted and may continue to result in an increasing effective tax rate over time if the actual results differ from our estimates we may have to adjust the effective tax rate in the interim period such determination is made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we use a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations

our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings at september 30 2005 and 2004 we had no commercial paper or bank borrowings outstanding during 2005 we had no commercial paper borrowings in 2004 the weighted average commercial paper borrowing was 18 million changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations if market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2005 or 2004 the effect on our results of operations would not have been significant

in october 2005 we issued 300 million of unsecured commercial paper obligations with maturities of 1 to 28 days we used the proceeds of the commercial paper to partially fund a 450 million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan trust made on october 11 2005 as these obligations mature we anticipate issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings

we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 7482 million at september 30 2005 and 7577 million at september 30 2004 the fair value of this debt was 8262 million at september 30 2005 and 8371 million at september 30 2004 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity

in september 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 615 notes payable in 2008 to floating rate debt based on sixmonth libor the floating rate was 623 percent at september 30 2005 a hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency in addition we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next four years contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations

we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately

at september 30 2005 and 2004 we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound sterling and australian dollar for us dollars the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during 2005 we continued to make improvements to the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting including those related to our information technology systems as part of a previously existing overall program on internal control and as part of the process of preparing for compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 some of these changes especially to our internal controls related to information technology systems could be deemed to have materially improved our internal control over financial reporting we anticipate that we will continue to make improvements

local or national unions raw materials and supplies   we purchase many items of equipment components and materials used in the production of our products from others the raw materials essential to the conduct of each of our business segments generally are available at competitive prices although we have a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules we have in the past experienced shortages of certain components and materials which had an adverse effect on our ability to make timely deliveries of certain products market forces particularly for certain raw materials have also caused significant increases in costs of those materials both shortages and cost increases if they occur again could have an adverse effect on our operating results backlog   our total order backlog was 5004 million at september 30 2004 and 3955 million at september 30 2003

disposal of radioactive and other hazardous substances constituting among other things violations of various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and misrepresentation and concealment of the facts relating thereto the plaintiffs who purportedly represent two classes sought compensatory damages of 250 million for diminution in value of real estate and other economic loss the creation of a fund of 150 million to finance medical monitoring and surveillance services exemplary damages of 300 million cercla response costs in an undetermined amount attorneys’ fees an injunction and other proper relief on february 13 1991 the court granted certain of the motions of the defendants to dismiss the case the plaintiffs subsequently filed a new complaint and on november 26 1991 the court granted in part a renewed motion to dismiss the remaining portion of the case is pending before the court on october 8 1993 the court certified separate medical monitoring and property value classes effective august 1 1996 the doe assumed control of the defense of the contractor defendants including us in the action beginning on that date the costs of our defense which had previously been reimbursed to us by the doe have been and are being paid directly by the doe we believe that we are entitled under applicable law and our contract with the doe to be indemnified for all costs and any liability associated with this action 6     on november 13 1990 we were served with another civil action brought against us in the same court by james stone claiming to act in the name of the united states alleging violations of the us false claims act in connection with our operation of the plant and seeking treble damages and forfeitures as well as a personal cause of action for alleged wrongful termination of employment on august 8 1991 the court dismissed the personal cause of action on december 6 1995 the doe notified us that it would no longer reimburse costs incurred by us in defense of the action on november 19 1996 the court granted the department of justice leave to intervene in the case on the government’s behalf on april 1 1999 a jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately 14 million in damages on may 18 1999 the court entered judgment against us for approximately 42 million trebling the jury’s award as required by the false claims act and imposing a civil penalty of 15000 if the judgment is affirmed on appeal mr stone will also be entitled to an award of attorney’s fees but the court refused to award fees until appeals from the judgment have been exhausted on september 24 2001 a panel of the 10th circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment on november 2 2001 we filed a petition for rehearing with the court of appeals seeking reconsideration of that portion of the decision holding that the relator mr stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees on march 4 2002 the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of making findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to mr stone’s relator status and the trial court having made findings of fact on the issue on march 15 2004 a panel of the court of appeals again ruled that mr stone is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees we believe that ruling is in error and have petitioned the 10th circuit court of appeals for en banc review we believe that an outcome adverse to us will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition we believe that we are entitled under applicable law and our contract with the doe to be indemnified for all costs and any liability associated with this action and intend to file a claim with the doe seeking reimbursement at the conclusion of the litigation   on january 8 1991 we filed suit in the united states claims court against the doe seeking recovery of 65 million of award fees that we allege are owed to us under the terms of our contract with the doe for management and operation of the plant during the period october 1 1988 through september 30 1989 on july 17 1996 the government filed an amended answer and counterclaim against us alleging violations of the us false claims act previously asserted in the civil action described in the preceding paragraph on march 20 1997 the court stayed the case pending disposition of the civil action described in the preceding paragraph on august 30 1999 the court continued the stay pending appeal in that civil action we believe the government’s counterclaim is without merit and believe we are entitled under applicable law and our contract with the doe to be indemnified for any liability associated with the counterclaim   russellville on august 13 2004 we received a favorable ruling from the kentucky supreme court in the principal case against us by private plaintiffs arising from alleged environmental contamination in russellville kentucky from a plant owned and operated by our measurement  flow control division prior to its divestiture in march 1989 this effectively ends a case in which a 218 million judgment had been entered against us in a civil action in the circuit court of logan county kentucky on a 1996 jury verdict the action had been brought by owners of flood plain real property in the area around russellville allegedly damaged by polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs discharged from our plant on january 14 2000 the kentucky court of appeals reversed the lower court’s judgment and directed entry of judgment in our favor on all claims as a matter of law on august 8 2003 the court of appeals issued a second decision holding that the amounts of pcbs alleged by plaintiffs to have contaminated their properties were insufficient to constitute an actionable injury under kentucky law thus requiring dismissal of plaintiffs’ suit with prejudice plaintiffs filed a petition for discretionary review with the kentucky supreme court which was denied on august 13 2004   on march 24 1997 the circuit court of franklin county kentucky in commonwealth of kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet vs rockwell  an action filed in 1986 seeking remediation of pcb

  solaia technology llc we and our wholly owned subsidiary rockwell software inc are parties in several suits in which solaia technology llc is adverse solaia is a singlepurpose entity formed to license us patent no 5038318 the ’318 patent solaia acquired the ’318 patent from schneider automation inc a competitor of ours in the field of factory automation schneider has retained certain interests in the ’318 patent including a share in solaia’s licensing income solaia has asserted that the ’318 patent covers computer controlled factory automation systems used throughout most modern factories in the united states   solaia has issued hundreds of demand letters to a wide range of factory owners and operators and has filed a series of lawsuits against over 40 companies alleging patent infringement a significant number of the companies sued by solaia have chosen to settle the claims for amounts that we believe are notably smaller than the likely legal costs of successfully defending solaia’s claims in court   in a suit filed by solaia on july 2 2002 in chicago solaia technology llc v arvinmeritor inc et al  02c4704 nd ill chicago patent suit solaia accused sixteen companies of infringing the ’318 patent we made arrangements with arvinmeritor which now owns and operates our former automotive business to undertake arvinmeritor’s defense of solaia’s patent claims to seek to assure that solaia’s infringement claim against arvinmeritor could be finally and actually adjudicated in the chicago patent suit in that case solaia responded on may 12 2003 by suing us directly for patent infringement demanding material monetary damages we believe that solaia’s claim against us in the chicago patent suit is wholly without merit and baseless discovery is completed in the case and dispositive summary judgment motions are pending no trial date has been set in this matter   prior to solaia’s claims of infringement against us in the chicago patent suit may 12 2003 we sought to protect our customers from solaia’s claims we brought an action in federal court in milwaukee on december 10 2002 against solaia its law firm niro scavone haller  niro and schneider automation rockwell automation inc et al v schneider automation inc et al case no 02c1195 ed wis asserting claims of tortious interference and civil conspiracy and alleging violations of federal antitrust and unfair competition laws the milwaukee action we are seeking monetary damages and other relief arising from the infringement claims solaia has made against our customers   in january 2003 solaia filed a lawsuit in federal court in chicago against us and several others solaia technology llc v rockwell automation inc et al  case no 03c566 nd ill alleging federal antitrust and unfair competition violations tortious interference defamation and other claims we deny any liability under those claims solaia’s antitrust and tort case has now been transferred to the federal court in milwaukee case no 03c939 ed wis and effectively consolidated with the milwaukee action and all proceedings in milwaukee have been administratively stayed   in december 2003 solaia filed a state court action in cook county illinois alleging tortious interference claims against us and one of our former officers this action was removed from state court and as with solaia’s january 2003 suit has been transferred to the federal court in milwaukee case no 04c368 ed wis   all of the milwaukee cases are in their earliest stages the federal court in milwaukee has stayed all three cases in milwaukee pending developments in the chicago patent suit   asbestos like thousands of other companies we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us together with hundreds of other companies as defendants the great bulk of the complaints however do not identify any of our products or specify which of these claimants if any were exposed to asbestos attributable to our products and past experience has shown that the vast majority of the claimants will never identify any of our products in addition when our products appear to be identified they are frequently from divested businesses and we are indemnified for most of the costs for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses in substantial part due to the 8   integrity of our products the encapsulated nature of any asbestoscontaining components and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants we defend those cases vigorously historically we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants we have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs over and above selfinsured retentions for most of these claims we have initiated litigation against our carriers nationwide indemnity company and kemper insurance to enforce the insurance policies although kemper’s status as a financially viable entity is in question we expect to recover the majority of defense and indemnity costs we have incurred to date over and above our selfinsured retentions and a substantial portion of the costs for defending asbestos claims going forward the uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and resolution of the litigation with our insurance companies make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate resolution of asbestos claims that uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  other various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment and contract matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend results of operations 

 

   this annual report contains statements including certain projections and business trends accompanied by such phrases as “believe” “estimate” “expect” “anticipate” “will” “intend” and other similar expressions that are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following    these forwardlooking statements are made only as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

   the following discussion includes sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and free cash flow which are nongaap measures see supplemental sales information on page 23 hereof for a reconciliation of reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in addition to a discussion of why we believe this nongaap measure is useful to investors see financial condition on page 21 hereof for a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow and a discussion of why we believe this nongaap measure is useful to investors 

 

   overall demand for our products is driven by  14    

 

   in 2004 sales in the us accounted for more than 60 percent of our total sales due to weaker business conditions in 2002 and 2003 especially in the us manufacturing economy manufacturers operated at historically low levels of plant capacity utilization during 2004 the manufacturing economy experienced improving fundamentals and higher levels of output in the us this is reflected in various indicators that we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our markets these indicators include    the table below depicts the trend for the indicated months since december 2001 in us industrial equipment spending capacity utilization and the pmi  

 

   outside the us growth in demand has in part been driven by investments made in infrastructure in emerging economies such as those found in the asiapacific and latin america regions demand for our products in china is moderating somewhat from the rapid expansion experienced in the first half of 2004 as a result of rising local interest rates and other economic and political factors but commercial activity in korea 15   and india has been strong in latin america demand for our products has been driven by investment in the mining and oil and gas industries resulting in increased sales in 2004 

 

   we serve a wide range of industries including consumer products transportation basic materials and oil and gas during 2004 we benefited from growing demand in nearly all of the industries we serve   our consumer products segment serves a broad array of customers in the food and beverage brewing consumer packaged goods and life sciences industries this group is generally less cyclical than other heavy manufacturing segments   sales to the automotive segment are affected by such factors as customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies   basic materials segments including mining aggregates and cement all benefit from higher commodities prices and higher global demand for basic materials that encourage significant investment in capacity and productivity in these industries   as energy prices rise customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity as they did during the latter half of 2004 in addition higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider new investment in more energyefficient manufacturing processes and technologies 

 

   the following is a summary of our objectives for 2005    our outlook for 2005 assumes that the current economic recovery will continue and that we will experience a favorable industrial environment with gradual growth during 2005 while we expect demand for our products to benefit from this trend we also assume that our growth will vary and may exceed or lag trend levels in any given quarter   as of the date hereof we expect to grow revenue in 2005 by 6 to 8 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and to raise operating margins to approximately 15 percent as of the date hereof we expect full year 2005 diluted earnings per share in the range of 215 to 225 and plan to generate free cash flow in excess of net income in part through disciplined capital deployment 16   

 

  

 

   in september 2004 we sold our firstpoint contact business for cash and a note convertible into a minority interest in the corporate parent of the buyer of the business resulting in a gain of 335 million 321 million after tax or 017 per diluted share the results of operations of firstpoint contact and the gain on sale are included in income from discontinued operations in this annual report 

 

    sales increased 10 percent compared to 2003 driven by growth at both control systems and power systems three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates   income from continuing operations in 2004 includes 463 million 024 per diluted share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters as well as the benefit of state tax refunds the 2003 17   result included a tax benefit of 694 million 037 per diluted share related to the settlement of a us federal research and experimentation credit refund claim 

 

    control systems sales increased 11 percent compared to 2003 four percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the us dollar sales outside of the us increased 15 percent 6 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and us sales increased 8 percent   control systems experienced sales growth in all regions with exceptional strength in the emerging economies of asia and latin america where we continued to increase market penetration sales growth was primarily driven by maintenance related and smaller productivity related projects these projects were the result of pentup demand after the period of underinvestment in productive assets during 2002 and 2003 in addition to these ongoing required investments we experienced an increase in activity related to larger scale projects in the second half of fiscal year 2004 these larger projects were driven by our customers’ requirements for incremental productivity improvements and capacity optimization   our logix platform business continued its strong growth with an increase of 30 percent over 2003 industrial components and adjustable speed drives experienced doubledigit growth as well these gains were partially offset by moderate declines in drive systems and legacy control platforms   segment operating margins increased due to higher volume favorable product mix and productivity improvements volume leverage improved during the year due to our continuing productivity efforts and ongoing facility rationalization programs 

 

    power systems sales increased 7 percent compared to 2003 the mechanical and electrical businesses contributed about equally to the growth the sales increase was mainly the result of volume strength in the second half of 2004 higher global demand for basic materials and subsequent higher prices for these materials encouraged significant investment in capacity optimization and productivity and drove our sales   significant cost and productivity initiatives launched in the second quarter financial leverage on incremental volume and price increases more than offset rising raw material prices resulting in the improved segment operating margin 

 

   general corporate expenses were 883 million in 2004 compared to 668 million in 2003 expense in 2004 includes charges of 164 million due to higher estimated costs for environmental remediation at several legacy sites 70 million of contributions to our charitable corporation and 50 million of costs associated with corporate staff changes expense in 2003 included a charge of 47 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at a legacy site 18   

 

   in the second quarter of 2003 we sold a majority of our ownership interest in reliance electric limited japan rej resulting in a loss of 84 million 25 million after tax or 001 per diluted share the cash proceeds from the transaction totaled 104 million 

 

   interest expense was 417 million in 2004 compared to 525 million in 2003 the decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the 1500 million principal amount of 680 notes in april 2003 the benefit of an interest rate swap see note 6 in the financial statements and lower average shortterm borrowings 

 

    sales increased 6 percent compared to 2002 three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates the growth was driven by a 7 percent increase at control systems which more than offset a 2 percent decrease at power systems   income from continuing operations before accounting change in 2003 included a tax benefit of 694 million or 037 per diluted share related to the settlement of a us federal research and experimentation credit refund claim the 2002 results included a tax benefit of 482 million or 026 per diluted share from the resolution of certain tax matters for the period 1995 through 1999 

 

    control systems sales increased 7 percent compared to 2002 more than 3 percentage points of the increase was due to the favorable impact of currency translation primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the us dollar sales outside of the us increased 18 percent 9 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and us sales increased 1 percent our logix platform business grew approximately 30 percent over 2002   the improvement in segment operating margin was due to higher volume and the continuing benefits of cost reduction actions 

 

  19     power systems sales decreased 2 percent compared to 2002 mechanical sales increased 3 percent while electrical sales decreased 5 percent segment operating earnings remained relatively stable despite the decrease in sales due to savings from cost reduction efforts 

 

   general corporate expenses were 668 million in 2003 compared to 574 million in 2002 expense in 2003 included a charge of 47 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at a legacy site the 2002 amount included 94 million of income related to the settlement of intellectual property matters excluding these amounts corporate expenses decreased in 2003 as a result of lower corporate staff costs and an increase of approximately 14 million in earnings from our investment in rsc 

 

   in the second quarter of 2003 we sold a majority of our ownership interest in rej resulting in a loss of 84 million 25 million after tax or 001 per diluted share the cash proceeds from the transaction totaled 104 million 

 

   interest expense was 525 million in 2003 compared to 661 million in 2002 the decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the 1500 million principal amount of 680 notes in april 2003 the benefit of an interest rate swap see note 6 in the financial statements and lower average shortterm borrowings 

 

   see note 13 in the financial statements for information regarding the composition of discontinued operations 

 

   during 2004 we recognized tax benefits of 463 million in income from continuing operations and 184 million in income from discontinued operations related to the following items    including these items the full year effective tax rate for 2004 was approximately 19 percent in the aggregate these items decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 11 percent   during 2003 we recognized in earnings a net tax benefit of 694 million related to a us federal research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax benefit of approximately 26 million as a result of our ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been previously provided the ability to utilize the capital loss carryforwards was the result of the sale of a majority of our ownership in rej which took place in 2003 the full year effective tax rate for 2003 was approximately 5 percent including the effect of the research and experimentation settlement 23 percent benefit and the rej transaction 1 percent benefit 20     see note 16 in the financial statements for a reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate   we expect that the effective income tax rate in 2005 will be approximately 31 percent excluding the income tax expense or benefit related to discrete items if any that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects   subsequent to september 30 2004 the president signed into law both the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 this legislation contains numerous corporate tax changes including eliminating a tax benefit relating to us product exports a new deduction relating to us manufacturing a lower us tax rate on nonus dividends and an extension of the research and experimentation credit this new legislation is not anticipated to materially affect our results of operations or our financial condition financial condition   the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions    our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy in our opinion free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies   free cash flow was 4989 million for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to 3123 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the following factors contributed to the significant increase in free cash flow    these factors more than offset the higher voluntary contributions to our us qualified pension trust which totaled 1250 million in 2004 compared to 500 million in 2003 21     we anticipate that cash payments for income taxes will approach our income tax expense in the near future   when necessary we utilize commercial paper as our principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2004 and 2003 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during 2004 and 2003 we did not have significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash position   in january 2004 we repaid our 84 million of industrial development revenue bonds prior to maturity using cash on hand in april 2003 we repaid our 1500 million principal amount of 680 notes at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings   we repurchased approximately 75 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 2584 million in 2004 at september 30 2004 we had approximately 1685 million remaining for stock repurchases under existing board authorizations we repurchased approximately 56 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 1284 million in 2003 we anticipate repurchasing stock in 2005 the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions stock price and other cash requirements   future significant uses of cash are expected to include capital expenditures dividends to shareowners acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common stock and may include contributions to our pension plans we expect capital expenditures in 2005 to be about 120 million additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in mda on page 14 hereof we expect that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities commercial paper borrowings a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities   in addition to cash generated by operating activities we have access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks our debttototalcapital ratio was 289 percent at september 30 2004 and 327 percent at september 30 2003   as of september 30 2004 we had 6750 million of unsecured committed credit facilities with 3375 million expiring in october 2004 and 3375 million expiring in october 2005 these facilities were available for general corporate purposes including support for our commercial paper borrowings on october 26 2004 we entered into a new fiveyear 6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility it replaced both the facility expiring on that date and the facility expiring in october 2005 which we cancelled on that date borrowings under our new credit facility bear interest based on shortterm money market rates in effect during the period such borrowings are outstanding the terms of our credit facility contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our debt to capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent in addition to our 6000 million credit facility shortterm unsecured credit facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to 1304 million at september 30 2004   the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30 2004    among other things our credit facility is a standby liquidity facility that can be drawn if needed to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper while we are not required to do so under our current policy with respect to these ratings we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facility if any to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow if needed to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures   should our access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured 22   committed credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 

  cash dividends to shareowners were 1225 million 066 per share in 2004 and 1224 million 066 per share in 2003 although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors we expect to pay quarterly dividends in 2005 at least equal to the quarterly per share amount paid in 2004   certain of our contractual cash obligations at september 30 2004 are summarized as follows  

 

   we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees see note 12 in the financial statements for information regarding these plans and expected future cash outflows related to the plans   at september 30 2004 we guaranteed the performance of conexant related to a lease obligation of approximately 600 million the lease obligation is secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the real property in consideration for this guarantee we received 250000 per quarter from conexant through december 31 2003 and receive 500000 per quarter from conexant through december 31 2004 unless we are released from the guarantee prior thereto we expect to be released from the guarantee in 2005   at september 30 2004 we and rockwell collins each guarantee onehalf of a lease agreement for one of rockwell scientific company llc’s rsc facilities the total future minimum payments under the lease are 55 million the lease agreement has a term that ends in december 2011 in addition we share equally with rockwell collins in providing a 40 million line of credit to rsc which bears interest at the greater of our or rockwell collins’ commercial paper borrowing rate at september 30 2004 and 2003 there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit during october 2004 the line of credit was increased to 60 million with us and rockwell collins still sharing equally supplemental sales information   we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period therefore reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates which are outside of our control we believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which 23   is a nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates we use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year 

  the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions    the following is a reconciliation of reported sales of our control systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions  critical accounting policies and estimates   we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported actual results could differ from those estimates we believe the following are the critical accounting policies that could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 

 

   sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists product has been delivered according to contract terms and acceptance as may be required by contract terms has occurred or services have been rendered pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 24     we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement we use shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history   we record accruals for customer returns rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed if the time period were to change by 10 percent the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately 40 million   the accrual for rebates and incentives to customers was 791 million at september 30 2004 and 708 million at september 30 2003 of which 78 million at september 30 2004 and 54 million at september 30 2003 was included as an offset to accounts receivable 

 

   we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired we use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results a significant decrease in the market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends   impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value to determine fair value we are required to make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed these estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services future market conditions and technological developments other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates during 2002 we recorded pretax impairment charges of 1287 million 1078 million after tax in connection with the adoption of sfas 142   we perform our annual impairment test on nonamortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year as of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the 728 million net book value of our reliance trademark approximated its estimated fair value as computed with the assistance of independent valuation specialists either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability rates could result in a material impairment charge to writedown the book value of the reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value   additional information regarding the impairment charges is contained in note 3 in the financial statements 

 

 

 

   pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by annually reviewing assumptions including discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets and assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees among other factors changes in the discount rate and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods   our worldwide pension expense in 2004 was 688 million compared to 416 million in 2003 approximately 80 percent of this cost relates to our us qualified pension plan we used the following 25   actuarial assumptions to determine our 2004 us pension expense discount rate of 60 percent compared to 70 percent for 2003 expected rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent compared to 85 percent for 2003 and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 45 percent compared to 45 percent for 2003 the decrease in discount rate as well as the amortization of actuarial losses were the primary causes of the 272 million increase in pension expense in 2004 over 2003 

  for 2005 we are assuming that the expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase will remain consistent with the 2004 assumptions but that the discount rate will increase from 60 to 625 assuming this discount rate increase and that actual experience is consistent with the actuarial assumptions we expect 2005 pension expense to remain approximately the same as 2004   the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for our us pension plans in millions    in 2004 we made voluntary contributions of 1250 million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to a 500 million voluntary contribution in 2003 we currently anticipate making contributions during 2005 to our qualified pension plans in an amount that approximates the 2005 net periodic pension cost   additional information regarding pension benefits including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

 

   we estimate with the assistance of independent actuarial consultants the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions including the discount rate and for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program expected trends in the cost for healthcare services changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods   effective october 1 2002 we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services as a result of this amendment there will be no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends beginning january 1 2005 this amendment reduced our other postretirement benefit obligation by 865 million   net periodic benefit cost in 2004 was approximately 234 million compared to 291 million in 2003 this decrease is primarily due to the effect of amending our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program   we expect net periodic benefit cost in 2005 of approximately 25 million the expected increase is due to the amortization of actuarial losses offset by an increase in the discount rate as of our june 30 2004 measurement date by 25 basis points to 625   additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note 12 in the financial statements 

 

   our principal selfinsurance programs include product liability and workers’ compensation where we selfinsure up to a specified dollar amount claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers we estimate the liability for the majority of the selfinsured 26   claims with the assistance of an independent actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods being valued adjustments to the selfinsured liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or outcome of liability claims the liability for these selfinsurance programs was 534 million at september 30 2004 and 511 million at september 30 2003 

  as described in item 3 legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago see item 3 on page 6 hereof for further discussion 

 

   we record liabilities for litigation claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and thirdparty sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party at thirdparty sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup to the extent that remediation procedures change additional contamination is identified or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change   the liability for environmental matters net of related receivables was 388 million at september 30 2004 and 289 million at september 30 2003 during 2004 we recorded adjustments totaling 169 million to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites these adjustments were in addition to an adjustment made during the fourth quarter of 2003 to increase the environmental reserve by 47 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at our legacy sites   our recorded liability for environmental matters almost entirely relates to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses but for which we retained the responsibility to remediate the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a material charge to earnings is low as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters we expect that gradually over a long period of time our environmental obligations will decline however changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations   in 2004 we recorded income of 76 million 46 million after tax as a result of a final judgment in a defense claim legal proceeding related to our former operation of the rocky flats facility of the department of energy this amount is in addition to income of 73 million 44 million after tax recognized in 2003 related to the rocky flats defense claim legal proceeding in march 2004 we received 151 million related to this matter this amount is displayed net of the related tax in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash provided by discontinued operations   additional information regarding litigation claims and contingencies is contained in note 17 in the financial statements see also item 3 legal proceedings  on page 6 hereof 

 

   we record a liability for probable income tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure to the extent our estimates differ from actual payments or assessments income tax expense is adjusted 27     our income tax positions are based on diligent research of the applicable income tax laws claimed with knowledge and vigorously defended we conduct business in many countries which requires an interpretation of the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction in which we do business differences and the interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments during 2004 we resolved certain tax matters resulting in our recognizing 345 million of tax benefits the majority of these matters related to nonus jurisdictions during 2002 we resolved certain matters from previous years resulting in a 482 million reduction of our income tax provision   while our tax positions are claimed with knowledge taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts in an effort to increase their tax revenue especially in instances where transactions involve two or more countries such cross border transactions between our affiliates involving the transfer price for products services andor intellectual property is one of the primary issues we face due to our presence in canadian markets canadian transfer pricing matters are the most significant of all countries in which we do business transfer pricing matters as well as legal structures relating to current and previouslydivested businesses represent nearly 57 million of our tax liabilities for income tax assessments   we have recorded a valuation allowance of 630 million at september 30 2004 for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards carryforwards the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the carryforwards that are expected to be realized an increase to income would result if we determine we will be able to utilize more carryforwards than currently expected   at the end of each interim reporting period we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg united states compared to nonunited states as well as tax planning strategies if the actual results are different from our estimates adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made   additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note 16 in the financial statements recently adopted accounting standards   see note 1 in the financial statements regarding recently adopted accounting standards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts interest rate risk   in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities we utilize a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations   our shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings at september 30 2004 and 2003 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during 2004 the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were 18 million compared to 265 million in 2003 there were no bank borrowings outstanding at september 30 2004 and 2003 our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings if market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2004 or 2003 the effect on our results of operations would not have been material 28     we had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 7577 million at september 30 2004 and 7724 million at september 30 2003 the fair value of this debt was 8371 million at september 30 2004 and 8434 million at september 30 2003 the potential reduction in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixedrate instruments and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity   in september 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 615 notes payable in 2008 to floating rate debt based on sixmonth libor the floating rate was 427 percent at september 30 2004 a hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations foreign currency risk   we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency in addition we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations   we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately   at september 30 2004 and 2003 we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro pound sterling swiss franc australian dollar and canadian dollar the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to our financial condition results of operations or shareowners’ equity 29

condition   the company’s cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized in the following table in millions    the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions    the company’s definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of the company and execute its strategy management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the company’s ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments service of debt principal dividends and share repurchases management uses free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate the performance of the company the company’s definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies   free cash flow was 327 million for the year ended september 30 2003 compared to 372 million for the year ended september 30 2002 the decrease in free cash flow was in part the result of a 50 million voluntary contribution made to the company’s primary us qualified pension plan trust in june 2003 compared to the 24 million contribution made in 2002 related to the spinoff of rockwell collins capital expenditures in 2003 were 109 million compared to 104 million in 2002 capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be 125 million to 135 million but will depend ultimately on business conditions   the company acquired weidmüller holding ag’s north american business and interwave technology inc during 2003 for approximately 26 million see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the businesses during 2002 the company acquired four businesses for approximately 71 million   the company elects to utilize commercial paper as its principal source of shortterm financing at september 30 2003 and 2002 the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended september 30 2003 the company had weighted average borrowings of 27 million under its commercial paper program at interest rates ranging from 11 percent to 14 percent during the year ended september 30 2002 the company had weighted average borrowings of 68 million under its commercial paper program at interest rates ranging from 18 percent to 27 percent 23     in april 2003 the company’s 150 million principal amount of 680 notes were retired at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings   the company repurchased approximately 56 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately 128 million in 2003 which included repurchases of approximately 70000 shares at a cost of approximately 16 million under a voluntary program that provided shareowners owning fewer than 100 shares of common stock the opportunity to sell all of their shares of common stock to the company without paying a commission at september 30 2003 the company had approximately 177 million remaining for stock repurchases under existing board authorizations the company did not repurchase any shares in 2002 the company anticipates repurchasing stock in 2004 the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions and other cash requirements   future significant uses of cash are expected to include capital expenditures dividends to shareowners acquisitions repurchases of common stock in connection with the company’s stock repurchase program and may include contributions to the company’s pension plans additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in mda on page 15 hereof it is expected that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by cash generated by operating activities and commercial paper borrowings a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities   in addition to cash generated by operating activities the company has access to existing financing sources including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks the company’s debttototalcapital ratio was 327 percent at september 30 2003 and 366 percent at september 30 2002   as of

expiring in october 2005 during october 2003 the company entered into a new 3375 million credit facility expiring in october 2004 outstanding commercial paper balances if any reduce the amount of available borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities the terms of the credit facilities contain a covenant under which the company would be in default if the company’s debt to capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent in addition to the 675 million credit facilities shortterm unsecured credit facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to 121 million at september 30 2003   the following is a summary of the company’s credit ratings as of september 30 2003     should the company’s access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise the company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings   cash dividends to shareowners were 122 million or 066 per share in 2003 and 2002 prior to the spinoff of rockwell collins the company paid quarterly cash dividends which on an annual basis equaled 102 per share since the spinoff of rockwell collins the company has paid quarterly cash dividends which on an annual basis equal 066 per share although declaration and payment of dividends by the company are at the sole discretion of the company’s board of directors the company expects to pay quarterly dividends in 2004 which on an annual basis are expected to equal 066 per share 24     certain of the company’s contractual cash obligations at september 30 2003 are summarized as follows  

 

   at september 30 2003 the company guaranteed the performance of conexant related to a 60 million lease obligation the lease obligation is secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the real property in consideration for this guarantee the company receives 250000 per quarter from conexant through december 31 2003 the guarantee expires in 2005   at september 30 2003 the company and rockwell collins each guarantee onehalf of a lease agreement for one of rsc’s facilities the total future minimum payments under the lease are approximately 6 million the lease agreement has a term which ends in december 2011 in addition the company shares equally with rockwell collins in providing a 4 million line of credit to rsc which bears interest at the greater of the company’s or rockwell collins’ commercial paper borrowing rate at september 30 2003 and 2002 there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   the company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

 

   in addition to cash provided by normal operating activities the company utilizes a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations the company is exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations   the company’s shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings at september 30 2003 and 2002 the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during 2003 the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were 27 million compared to 68 million in 2002 there were no bank borrowings outstanding at september 30 2003 at september 30 2002 the carrying value of bank borrowings was 10 million the company’s results of operations are affected by changes in market 25   interest rates on commercial paper borrowings if market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2003 or 2002 the effect on the company’s results of operations would not have been material the fair values of these obligations approximated their carrying values at september 30 2002 and would not have been materially affected by changes in market interest rates 

  the company had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 773 million at september 30 2003 and 919 million at september 30 2002 the fair value of this debt was 844 million at september 30 2003 and 976 million at september 30 2002 the potential loss in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments other than 8 million of industrial development revenue bonds which the company expects to repay in january 2004 prior to maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the company’s results of operations or shareowners’ equity   in september 2002 the company entered into an interest rate swap contract which effectively converted its 350 million aggregate principal amount of 615 notes payable in 2008 to floating rate debt based on sixmonth libor the floating rate was 352 percent at september 30 2003 a hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or the company’s results of operations 

 

   the company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies the company’s objective is to minimize its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency in addition the company enters into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries it is the policy of the company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge its exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to the company’s financial condition or results of operations   the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings   at september 30 2003 and 2002 the company had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro pound sterling canadian dollar and swiss franc the use of these contracts allows the company to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to the financial condition results of operations or shareowners’ equity of the company recently adopted accounting standards   see note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding recently adopted accounting standards 26   supplemental sales information   the following is a reconciliation for the control systems segment of reported sales to sales excluding currency translation which is a nongaap measure    the following is a reconciliation for the company of reported sales to sales excluding currency translation which is a nongaap measure    the effect of currency translation is determined by translating the respective period sales data using the same exchange rates as the preceding year management believes sales excluding currency translation provides useful information to investors since it reflects regional performance from the company’s activities without the effect of changes in currency rates which is outside the control of management management uses sales excluding currency translation to monitor and evaluate the company’s regional performance cautionary statement   this annual report contains statements including certain projections and business trends accompanied by such phrases as “believes” “estimates” “expects” “anticipates” “will” “intends” and other similar expressions that are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to economic and political changes in international markets where the company competes such as currency exchange rates inflation rates recession foreign ownership restrictions and other external factors over which the company has no control demand for and market acceptance of new and existing products including levels of capital spending in industrial markets successful development of advanced technologies competitive product and pricing pressures future terrorist attacks epidemics and the uncertainties of litigation as well as other risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those detailed from time to time in the company’s securities and exchange commission filings these forwardlooking statements are made only as of the date hereof and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 27

  future significant uses of cash are expected to include capital expenditures dividends to shareowners acquisitions repurchases of common stock in connection with the company’s stock repurchase program and may include contributions to the qualified pension plan trust additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in mda on page 15 hereof in addition the company’s 150 million of 68 notes mature in april 2003 it is expected that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances cash generated by operating activities and commercial paper borrowings although the funding may include a new issue of debt or other securities   the company elects to utilize commercial paper markets as its principal source of shortterm financing as of september 30 2002 the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended september 30 2002 the company had weighted average borrowings of 68 million under its commercial paper program at interest rates ranging from 18 percent to 27 percent   as of september 30 2002 the company had 1 billion of unsecured committed credit facilities available to support its commercial paper borrowings on october 29 2002 the company terminated these credit facilities and entered into new credit facilities with various banks for 3375 million expiring in october 2003 and 3375 million expiring in october 2005 prior to october 2003 the company expects to enter into a new credit facility similar to the credit facility expiring at that time in an amount deemed sufficient to support its operations pursuant to the terms of the new credit facilities the company’s debt to capital ratio shall not exceed 60 percent outstanding commercial paper balances reduce the amount of available borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities   the company’s current commercial paper credit ratings are as follows moody’s p2 standard  poor’s a1 and fitch f1 should the company’s access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise the company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide shortterm funding in such event the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities would likely be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings   cash dividends to shareowners were 122 million or 066 per share in 2002 compared to 170 million or 093 per share in 2001 prior to the spinoff of rockwell collins the company paid quarterly cash dividends which on an annual basis equaled 102 per share since the spinoff of rockwell collins the company has paid quarterly cash dividends which on an annual basis equal 066 per share although declaration and payment of dividends by the company are at the sole discretion of the company’s board of directors the company expects to pay quarterly dividends in 2003 which on an annual basis will equal 066 per share   certain of the company’s contractual cash obligations at september 30 2002 are summarized as follows    in connection with the sale of a power systems business in 2000 the company entered into a supply agreement with the buyer of the business the agreement requires minimum purchases by the company of approximately 21 million per year through december 31 2005 in the event that purchases are less than 21 million in a given year the company may incur penalties which are a percentage of the amount by which the actual purchases were less than the contractual minimum for the period based upon current estimates of 23   future purchases management does not believe that any penalties payable under the terms of the agreement would be material to the company’s business or financial condition 

  at september 30 2002 the company guaranteed the performance of conexant related to a 60 million lease obligation the lease obligation is secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the real property management expects to be released from the guarantee by december 31 2003   at september 30 2002 the company was the sole guarantor of the performance of rsc under a lease agreement for one of rsc’s facilities the total future minimum payments under the lease are approximately 7 million the lease agreement has a term which ends in 2011 effective october 2002 the company and rockwell collins each guarantees onehalf of the lease obligation of rsc quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   the company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 

 

   in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities the company utilizes a combination of shortterm and longterm debt to finance operations the company is exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations   the company’s shortterm debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings at september 30 2002 and 2001 the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during 2002 the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were 68 million compared to 293 million in 2001 at september 30 2002 the carrying value of bank borrowings was 10 million compared to 9 million at september 30 2001 the company’s results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on these shortterm obligations if market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2002 or 2001 the effect on the company’s results of operations would not have been material the fair values of these obligations approximated their carrying values at september 30 2002 and 2001 and would not have been materially affected by changes in market interest rates   the company had outstanding fixed rate longterm debt obligations with carrying values of 919 million at september 30 2002 and 910 million at september 30 2001 the fair value of this debt was 976 million at september 30 2002 and 898 million at september 30 2001 the potential loss in fair value on such fixedrate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the company’s results of operations or shareowners’ equity   in september 2002 the company entered into an interest rate swap contract the swap which effectively converted its 350 million aggregate principal amount of 615 notes payable in 2008 to floating rate debt based on sixmonth libor the floating rate was 421 percent at september 30 2002 a hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or the company’s results of operations 

 

   the company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies the company’s objective is to minimize its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other 24   than the applicable functional currency in addition the company enters into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries it is the policy of the company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge its exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

  the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings for derivatives that are hedges depending on the nature of the hedge changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings   at september 30 2002 and 2001 the company had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro pound sterling canadian dollar and swiss franc the use of these contracts allows the company to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to the financial condition results of operations or shareowners’ equity of the company new accounting standards   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 143 which requires entities to recognize the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets in the period incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made   in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used and for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale under sfas 144 the presentation of discontinued operations is broadened to include a component of an entity rather than being limited to a segment of a business also accrual of future operating losses of discontinued businesses will no longer be permitted   in july 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 146 which addresses financial accounting and reporting associated with exit or disposal activities under sfas 146 the company will measure costs associated with an exit or disposal activity at fair value and recognize the costs in the period in which the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan   the company is required to adopt sfas 143 and sfas 144 at the beginning of fiscal year 2003 management is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas 143 and sfas 144 but believes there will be no material effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or shareowners’ equity at the time of adoption the company is required to adopt sfas 146 for all exit and disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 cautionary statement   this annual report contains statements including certain projections and business trends accompanied by such phrases as “believes” “estimates” “expects” “anticipates” “will” and other similar expressions that are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to economic and political changes in international markets where the company competes such as 25   currency exchange rates inflation rates recession foreign ownership restrictions and other external factors over which the company has no control demand for and market acceptance of new and existing products including levels of capital spending in industrial markets successful development of advanced technologies competitive product and pricing pressures future terrorist attacks and the uncertainties of litigation as well as other risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those detailed from time to time in the company’s securities and exchange commission filings these forwardlooking statements are made only as of the date hereof and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise
