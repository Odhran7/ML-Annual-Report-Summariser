energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance that qualifying customers receive dte electric works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte electric also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to customers 

strategy and competition 

dte electrics electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a costeffective manner and support dte energys goal to reduce carbon emissions by 32 by 2023 50 by 2028 and 80 by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels as well as net zero emissions by 2050 an increasing amount of high wind and other extreme weather events driven by climate change coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the longterm in addition with potential capacity constraints in the miso region there will be increased dependency on dte electrics generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers to maintain reliability and meet the carbon reduction goals in the nearterm dte electric plans to put in service a natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility in 2022 and will continue its energy waste reduction initiatives and transition away from coalfired plants to renewable energy and other sources to achieve longterm carbon reduction goals dte electric is monitoring the viability of emerging technologies involving energy storage carbon capture and sequestration alternative fuels such as hydrogen and advanced nuclear power 

dte electrics distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to customers dte electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

the electric retail access program in michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan has placed a 10 cap on total retail access this cap mitigates some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on dte electrics financial performance and fullservice customer rates customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers and represented approximately 10 85 and 10 of retail sales in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively dte electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales in 2022 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers dte electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the risk factors in item 1a of this report

 item 1a risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of the registrants utility businesses and dte energys nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the registrants below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses although the registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect performance 

regulatory legislative and legal risks 

the registrants are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization the registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies the registrants ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurring of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations regulators may also disagree with the registrants rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business if the registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact the registrants ability to recover certain costs through customer rates regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for the registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers the registrants cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how the business operates impact the registrants ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery or require the registrants to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric retail access program could negatively impact the registrants financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for dte electric customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes the registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity 

environmental laws and liability may be costly the registrants are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in the registrants generation fleet and for dte energys gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require the registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals the registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally the registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body the registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

the registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulations of ghg emissions are implemented or if existing deadlines for these regulations are accelerated the operations of dte electrics fossilfueled generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process the registrants financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

the renewable portfolio standard and energy waste reduction may affect the registrants business and federal and state fuel standards may affect dte energys nonutility investments the registrants are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy the registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future in addition the registrants expect to comply with new michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

in addition the registrants are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the registrants revenues as customers decrease their energy usage the registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results 

dte energys nonutility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal renewable fuel standard and californias low carbon fuel standard changes to these standards may affect dte energys business and result in lower earnings 

dte energys ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources the registrants generated production tax credits from renewable energy generation and dte energy generated production tax credits from renewable gas recovery reduced emission fuel and gas production operations if the registrants production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit or changes in tax law there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the registrants earnings and cash flows 

operational risks 

the registrants electric distribution system and dte energys gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation which could reduce revenues increase expenses and have a material adverse effect on their business financial position and results of operations the registrants electric distribution and dte energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks these operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years equipment even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices is subject to operational failure including events that are beyond the registrants control and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently because the registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of the registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties 

construction and capital improvements to the registrants power facilities and dte energys distribution systems subject them to risk the registrants are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at the registrants multiple power generation and distribution facilities and at dte energys gas distribution system many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the registrants control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals including required certificates from regulatory agencies construction disputes impediments to acquiring rightsofway or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms cost overruns and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the registrants financial performance operations or expected investment returns at the affected facilities businesses and development projects 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects the registrants to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the registrants to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options insurance maintained by the registrants for various nuclearrelated risks may not be sufficient to cover the registrants costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant which may affect the registrants financial performance in addition the registrants nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning a decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the registrants’ liquidity financial position or results of operations 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact the registrants financial results the registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations dte energys access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers dte energys nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts dte electric charges utility customers for electricity and dte gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of dte energys nonutility businesses the registrants hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations 

the price of energy also impacts the market for dte energys nonutility businesses particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers the price of environmental attributes generated by dte energys renewable natural gas investments including those related to the federal renewable fuel standard and californias low carbon fuel standard may also impact the market and financial results for dte energys nonutility businesses 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact the registrants financial results  the registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of their facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the registrants utility products and for dte energy on the profitability of the nonutility businesses 

weather including extreme weather caused by climate change significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the registrants earnings and cash flows mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the registrants assets lowering income and cash flows at dte electric ice storms floods tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process prolonged andor more frequent outages caused by extreme weather could also negatively impact dte energys reputation and customer satisfaction or result in increased regulatory oversight and related damages to customer assets could subject dte energy to litigation dte gas can also experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weatherrelated issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance the registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation the registrants financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs 

a work interruption may adversely affect the registrants there are several bargaining units for dte energys approximately 5200 and dte electrics approximately 2700 represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2027 a union choosing to strike would have an impact on the registrants businesses the registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance 

dte energy may not achieve the net zero carbon emissions goals of its electric and gas utilities dte energy has announced the voluntary commitments of its electric and gas utilities to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 technology research and developments innovations and advancements are critical to dte energys ability to achieve this commitment other factors that may impact dte energys ability to achieve these net zero goals include our service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with current expectations the impacts on our business of future regulations or legislation the price and availability of carbon offsets adoption of alternative energy products by the public such as greater use of electric vehicles greater standardization of emissions reporting and our ability over time to transition our electric generating portfolio dte energys net zero goals require making assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties should one or more of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect our actual results and ability to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 could differ materially from expectations in addition dte energy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving this objective or the various implementation aspects on its reliability or its results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

financial economic and market risks 

dte energys nonutility businesses may not perform to its expectations dte energy relies on nonutility businesses for a portion of earnings and will depend on the successful execution of new business development in its nonutilities to help achieve overall growth targets dte energy also expects that the loss of earnings from ceasing the operations of its ref nonutility business will be offset by growth in renewable energy and industrial services projects over the long term however such opportunities may not materialize as anticipated if dte energys current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels dte energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value 

adverse changes in the registrants credit ratings may negatively affect them regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in the registrants economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in the registrants credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in the registrants credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact their liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the registrants liquidity and results of operations the registrants costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and the registrants required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the registrants plans the registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below the registrants projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the registrants utility customers the results of operations and financial position of the registrants could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets the registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the registrants cash flows financial position or results of operations 

the registrants ability to access capital markets is important the registrants ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain the registrants ability as well as the ability of their subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the registrants access to capital markets the registrants longterm revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2024 and 2025 but the registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the registrants utilities and dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the registrants  advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include costeffective renewable energy technologies distributed generation energy waste reduction technologies and energy storage devices such developments may impact the price of energy may affect energy deliveries as customerowned generation becomes more costeffective may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply andor distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy each of these factors could materially affect the registrants’ results of operations cash flows or financial position 

dte energys participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations dte energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed dte energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose dte energy to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks dte energys trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines dte energy sets resulting from the management of dte energys business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish dte energys financial results and financial position dte energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

regional national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the registrants the registrants utility and dte energys nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with should the financial conditions of some of dte energys significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional national or international economic conditions reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services dte energy supplies collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows 

if dte energys goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it may be required to record a charge to earnings dte energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment goodwill and other intangible assets are also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization slower industry growth rates or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows dte energy cannot predict the timing strength or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery if the carrying value of any goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be not recoverable dte energy may take a noncash impairment charge which could materially impact dte energys results of operations and financial position 

the registrants may not be fully covered by insurance the registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters war terrorism cyber incidents or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the registrants operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or the registrants insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations 

safety and security risks 

the registrants businesses have safety risks the registrants electric distribution system power plants renewable energy equipment and other facilities and dte energys gas distribution system gas infrastructure and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury death or property loss to employees customers third parties or the public although the registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident they could experience financial loss damage to their reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

threats of cyber incidents physical security and terrorism could affect the registrants business issues may threaten the registrants such as cyber incidents physical security or terrorism that may disrupt the registrants operations and could harm the registrants operating results 

information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches the registrants industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents physical security threats acts of war or terrorism and other causes as well as loss of operational control of the registrants electric generation and distribution assets and dte energys gas distribution assets the registrants have experienced and expect to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents if the registrants information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way the registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business operating results and financial condition 

suppliers vendors contractors and information technology providers have access to systems that support the registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data a breach of these thirdparty systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system also  because the registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility electric generator system operator or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the registrants’ businesses operating results and financial condition 

in addition the registrants generation plants and electrical distribution facilities may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products the registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the registrants cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the registrants in connection with the registrants businesses they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers shareholders and employees customers shareholders and employees expect that the registrants will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the registrants reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

general and other risks 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect the registrants businesses and operations the covid19 pandemic is currently impacting countries communities supply chains and markets the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus such as quarantines closures or reduced operations of businesses governmental agencies and other institutions have resulted in disruptions in various public commercial and industrial activities and have caused employee absences which interfered with certain operation and maintenance of the registrants facilities travel bans and restrictions quarantines and shelter in place orders could also cause us to experience operational delays delay the delivery of critical infrastructure and other supplies we source globally or delay the connection of electric or gas service to new customers and have reduced the use of electricity and gas by certain customers in the commercial and industrial segments any of the foregoing circumstances could adversely affect customer demand or revenues impact the ability of the registrants suppliers vendors or contractors to perform or cause other unpredictable events which could adversely affect the registrants businesses results of operations or financial condition the continued spread of covid19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the financial markets which could increase the registrants costs to fund capital requirements and impact the operating results of our energy trading operations to the extent that the registrants access to the capital markets is adversely affected by covid19 the registrants may need to consider alternative sources of funding for our operations and for working capital any of which could increase the registrants cost of capital the extent to which covid19 may continue to impact the registrants liquidity financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information concerning the severity of covid19 and its related variants vaccine distribution and public acceptance and other actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions can resume among others our business continuity plans and insurance coverage may be insufficient to mitigate these adverse impacts to our business 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the registrants ’ operations the registrants businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the registrants business and future operating results in addition the registrants have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations 

dte energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from the utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

the spinoff of dt midstream the spinoff may not achieve its intended benefits and may present additional risk to dte energy as a result of the spinoff dte energy faces new and unique risks including having fewer assets reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources the spinoff may not achieve some or all of its anticipated benefits and we face risks providing dt midstream with transition services each of these factors may adversely impact dte energys financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the spinoff dte received a legal opinion that the distribution of shares of dt midstream to dte energy shareholders qualifies as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code however if the irs determined on audit that the distribution is taxable both dte energy and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

following the spinoff the management and directors of each of dte energy and dt midstream own common stock in both companies and robert skaggs jr who is dt midstreams executive chairman also serves on dte energys board and may be required to recuse himself from deliberations relating to arrangements between dte energy and dt midstream in the future this ownership and directorship overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other company potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of commercial arrangements that dte energy and dt midstream have or may enter into in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following combined discussion is separately filed by dte energy and dte electric however dte electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to dte energy or the subsidiaries of dte energy other than itself 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2021 operating revenues of approximately 150 billion and total assets of approximately 397 billion dte energy is the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan dte energy also operates two energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

on july 1 2021 dte energy completed the separation of its natural gas pipeline storage and gathering nonutility business effective with the separation dte retains no ownership in the new company dt midstream which was formerly comprised of dte energy’s gas storage and pipelines segment and certain dte energy holding company activity within the corporate and other segment gas storage and pipelines is no longer a reportable segment of dte energy and financial results of dt midstream are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements “dispositions and impairments” for additional information regarding the separation of dt midstream and discontinued operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below reflect dte energy’s continuing operations unless noted otherwise the following table summarizes dte energys financial results 



the decrease in 2021 net income attributable to dte energy company was primarily due to lower earnings in the corporate and other segment driven primarily by losses on the extinguishment of debt incurred in 2021 the decrease was also due to lower earnings in the energy trading segment partially offset by higher earnings in the electric gas and dte vantage segments the increase in 2020 net income attributable to dte energy company was primarily due to higher earnings in the electric and corporate and other segments partially offset by lower earnings in the energy trading segment 

strategy 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth with a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend 

dte energys utilities are investing capital to support a modern reliable grid and cleaner affordable energy through investments in base infrastructure and new generation an increasing amount of high wind and other extreme weather events driven by climate change coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the longterm 

dte energy is committed to reducing the carbon emissions of its electric utility operations by 32 by 2023 50 by 2028 and 80 by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels dte energy is also committed to a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for its electric and gas utility operations to achieve the carbon reduction goals at the electric utility dte energy has begun to transition away from coalpowered sources and is replacing or offsetting the generation from these facilities with renewable energy and energy waste reduction initiatives refer to the capital investments section below for further discussion regarding dte energys retirement of its aging coalfired plants and transition to renewable energy and other sources over the longterm dte energy is also monitoring the viability of emerging technologies involving energy storage carbon capture and sequestration alternative fuels such as hydrogen and advanced nuclear power 

for gas utility operations dte energy aims to cut carbon emissions across the entire value chain to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 for both internal operations and from suppliers dte energy is working to source gas with lower methane intensity reduce emissions through its gas main renewal and pipeline integrity programs and if necessary use carbon offsets to address any remaining emissions dte energy is also committed to helping dte gas customers reduce their emissions by 35 by 2050 by increasing energy efficiency pursuing advanced technologies such as hydrogen and through the cleanvision natural gas balance program which provides customers the option to use carbon offsets and renewable natural gas 

dte energy expects that these initiatives at the electric and gas utilities will continue to provide significant opportunities for capital investments and result in earnings growth dte energy is focused on executing its plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability dte energys utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with their regulators 

dte energy also has significant investments in nonutility businesses and expects growth opportunities in its dte vantage segment dte energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets skills and expertise and provides diversity in earnings and geography specifically dte energy invests in targeted markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity dte energy has an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

dte energys utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements capital plans may be regularly updated as these requirements change 

dte electrics capital investments over the 20222026 period are estimated at 15 billion comprised of 8 billion for distribution infrastructure 4 billion for base infrastructure and 3 billion for cleaner generation including renewables dte electric has retired six coalfired generation units at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities and has announced plans to retire its remaining eleven coalfired generating units including five units at trenton channel and st clair in 2022 the two units at the belle river facility will cease the use of coal by 2028 and will be evaluated for conversion to cleaner energy resources the four units at the monroe facility are expected to be retired by 2040 generation from the retired facilities will be replaced or offset with a combination of renewables energy waste reduction demand response and natural gas fueled generation including the blue water energy center which will commence operations in 2022 

dte gas capital investments over the 20222026 period are estimated at 31 billion comprised of 15 billion for base infrastructure and 16 billion for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs 

dte electric and dte gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment 

dte energys nonutility businesses capital investments are primarily for expansion growth and ongoing maintenance in the dte vantage segment including approximately 1 billion to 15 billion from 20222026 for renewable energy and industrial energy services projects 

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations including those to address climate change additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially the registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers as authorized by the mpsc 

increased costs for energy produced from traditional coalbased sources due to recent pending and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable natural gas fueled generation andor nuclear sources energy waste reduction initiatives and the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon instruments which could provide new business opportunities for dte energys utility and nonutility segments at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on the registrants or their customers 

see items 1 and 2 business and properties and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry dte energys strong utility base combined with its integrated nonutility operations position it well for longterm growth 

looking forward dte energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance 

• electric and gas customer satisfaction 

• electric distribution system reliability 

• new electric generation and decarbonization 

• gas distribution system renewal 

• rate competitiveness and affordability 

• regulatory stability and investment recovery for the electric and gas utilities 

• strategic investments in growth projects at dte vantage 

• employee engagement health safety and wellbeing and diversity equity and inclusion 

• cost structure optimization across all business segments and 

• cash capital and liquidity to maintain or improve financial strength 

the separation of dt midstream on july 1 2021 will result in a reduction to dte energys net income and cash flows in the near term however dte energy remains wellpositioned for longterm growth and focused on the key objectives noted above dte energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic financial and risk criteria 

covid19 pandemic 

dte energy has been monitoring the covid19 pandemic and any related impacts to operating costs customer demand and the recoverability of assets in our business segments that could materially impact the registrants financial results 

as noted in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies the pandemic has contributed to a shift in electric sales volumes from commercial and industrial customers to residential customers dte energy expects this shift to continue in the near term as businesses maintain more remote operations other impacts from covid19 have related primarily to health and safetyrelated costs at the utilities and volumes at certain nonutility businesses but these impacts have not been significant in 2021 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the results of operations section below including impacts from the covid19 pandemic where applicable 

dte energy will continue to monitor these impacts as well as any regulatory and legislative activities related to covid19 the registrants cannot predict the ultimate impact of these factors to our consolidated financial statements as future developments involving covid19 and related impacts on economic and operating conditions are highly uncertain for further discussion of these uncertainties refer to risk factors in item 1a of this report

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as the nongaap financial measures utility margin and nonutility margin discussed below which dte energy uses as measures of its operational performance generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

dte energy uses utility margin and nonutility margin nongaap financial measures to assess its performance by reportable segment 

utility margin includes electric utility and gas utility operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses the utilities’ fuel purchased power and natural gas supply are passed through to customers and therefore result in changes to the utilities’ revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses as such dte energy believes utility margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the utilities’ operations across periods as it excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses for the electric segment nonutility operating revenues are reported separately so that utility margin can be used to assess utility performance 

the nonutility margin relates to the dte vantage and energy trading segments for the dte vantage segment nonutility margin primarily includes operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses operating revenues include sales of refined coal to third parties and the affiliated electric utility metallurgical coke and related byproducts petroleum coke renewable natural gas and related credits and electricity as well as rental income and revenues from utilitytype consulting management and operational services for the energy trading segment nonutility margin includes revenue and realized and unrealized gains and losses from physical and financial power and gas marketing optimization and trading activities net of purchased power and gas related to these activities dte energy evaluates its operating performance of these nonutility businesses using the measure of operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses 

utility margin and nonutility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap utility margin and nonutility margin do not intend to represent operating income the most comparable gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of dte energys segments segment information described below includes intercompany revenues and expenses and other income and deductions that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 



electric 

the results of operations discussion for dte electric is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with general instruction i 2 a of form 10k for whollyowned subsidiaries 

the electric segment consists principally of dte electric electric results and outlook are discussed below 



see dte electrics consolidated statements of operations in item 8 of this report for a complete view of its results differences between the electric segment and dte electrics consolidated statements of operations are primarily due to nonutility operations at dte sustainable generation and the classification of certain benefit costs refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements retirement benefits and trusteed assets for additional information 

utility margin increased 158 million in 2021 and 283 million in 2020 revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the registrants consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

  

a variances reflect the 90 million voluntary refund recognized in 2021 for the incremental tree trim surge and the 30 million covid19 voluntary refund recognized in 2020 refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters for additional information regarding these refunds and the related regulatory liabilities 



 

a represents power that is not distributed by dte electric 

b represents deliveries for selfgenerators that have purchased power from alternative energy suppliers to supplement their power requirements 

dte electric sales volumes increased in 2021 primarily attributable to commercial customers which were impacted more significantly in 2020 by the covid19 pandemic and temporary shutdowns of certain commercial operations 

operating revenues — nonutility operations decreased 2 million in 2021 and increased 9 million in 2020 the decrease in 2021 was primarily due to lower sales volumes at dte sustainable generation the increase in 2020 was due to renewable energy projects acquired in january 2020 

operation and maintenance expense increased 67 million in 2021 and 55 million in 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher ewr expense of 45 million higher distribution operations expense of 42 million primarily due to higher storm costs higher corporate support costs of 21 million higher legal and environmental expense of 15 million and higher benefits expense of 13 million these increases were partially offset by lower covid19 related expenses of 43 million lower uncollectible expense of 26 million and lower plant generation expense of 4 million 

the increase in 2020 was primarily due to covid19 related expenses of 50 million higher benefits expense of 15 million higher ewr expense of 11 million higher rps expenses of 9 million and an 11 million adjustment in 2019 to defer expenses previously accrued for a new customer billing system these increases were partially offset by lower plant generation expense of 25 million and lower distribution operations expense of 12 million 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 65 million in 2021 and 108 million in 2020 in 2021 the increase was primarily due to a 64 million increase resulting from a higher depreciable base in 2020 the increase was primarily due to a 108 million increase resulting from a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective may 2019 and a 10 million increase resulting from new nonutility assets at dte sustainable generation partially offset by a decrease of 11 million associated with the trm 

taxes other than income increased 24 million in 2021 and decreased 14 million in 2020 in 2021 the increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 22 million as a result of an increase in tax base and a favorable property tax settlement in 2020 in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to lower property taxes of 9 million as a result of a property tax settlement partially offset by an increase in tax base the decrease in 2020 was also due to lower payroll taxes of 3 million which was primarily attributable to employee retention credits recognized pursuant to the cares act 

asset gains losses and impairments net decreased 40 million in 2021 and increased 28 million in 2020 the decrease in 2021 was primarily due to lower activity in the current year compared to a 41 million writeoff of capital expenditures related to incentive compensation in 2020 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to the 41 million writeoff of capital expenditures which were disallowed in the may 8 2020 rate order from the mpsc compared to losses of 13 million in 2019 

other income and deductions decreased 43 million in 2021 and increased 81 million in 2020 the decrease in 2021 was primarily due to lower contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations of 28 million a change in rabbi trust investment earnings net gain of 7 million in 2021 compared to a net loss of 3 million in 2020 and lower nonoperating retirement benefits expense of 4 million the increase in 2020 was primarily due to a change in rabbi trust investment earnings net loss of 3 million in 2020 compared to a gain of 37 million in 2019 30 million of contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations and 22 million of higher interest expense these increases were partially offset by a 2019 accrual of 6 million associated with an environmentalrelated settlement 

income tax expense decreased 4 million in 2021 and 29 million in 2020 the decrease in both 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to higher amortization of the tcja regulatory liability and higher production tax credits partially offset by higher earnings 

outlook — dte electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while keeping customer rate increases affordable looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and effects of energy waste reduction programs 

on march 26 2021 dte electric filed an application requesting a financing order approving the securitization financing of 184 million of qualified costs related to the net book value of the river rouge generation plant and tree trimming surge program costs the filing requested recovery of these qualifying costs from dte electrics customers a final mpsc financing order was issued on june 23 2021 authorizing dte electric to proceed with the issuance of securitization bonds for qualified costs of up to 236 million increased for the inclusion of deferred taxes the financing order further authorized customer charges for the timely recovery of the debt service costs on the securitization bonds and other ongoing qualified costs securitization financing is expected to occur in march 2022 

dte electric filed a rate case with the mpsc on january 21 2022 requesting an increase in base rates of 388 million based on a projected twelvemonth period ending october 31 2023 the requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from generation and distribution investments as well as related increases to depreciation and property tax expenses the rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 99 to 1025 and includes projected changes in sales a final mpsc order in this case is expected in november 2022 refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters for additional information 

gas 

the gas segment consists principally of dte gas gas results and outlook are discussed below 



utility margin increased 73 million in 2021 and 3 million in 2020 revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in dte energys consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





the change in sales in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in enduser transportation volumes including lower generation needs at certain industrial customers the decrease in sales in 2020 was primarily due to more unfavorable weather compared to 2019 intermediate transportation volumes fluctuate period to period based on available market opportunities 

operation and maintenance expense increased 25 million in 2021 and decreased 19 million in 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher gas operations expense of 41 million partially offset by lower uncollectible expense of 15 million the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower gas operations expense of 36 million partially offset by higher ewr expense of 7 million higher corporate overhead costs of 3 million and a 6 million adjustment in 2019 to defer expenses previously accrued for a new customer billing system 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 20 million in 2021 and 13 million in 2020 the increase in both periods was primarily due to a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective october 2020 

taxes other than income increased 9 million in 2021 and 4 million in 2020 the 2021 increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 6 million and employee retention credits of 3 million recognized in 2020 pursuant to the cares act the 2020 increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 8 million partially offset by the employee retention credits of 3 million 

asset gains losses and impairments net decreased 10 million in 2021 and increased 14 million in 2020 the decrease in 2021 was due to lower activity in the current year including 4 million of capital writeoffs compared to a 14 million writeoff of capital expenditures related to incentive compensation in 2020 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to the 14 million writeoff of capital expenditures which were disallowed in the july 17 2020 rate case settlement 

other income and deductions increased 11 million in 2021 and 4 million in 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily due to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations the increase in 2020 was primarily due to lower investment earnings of 2 million and higher interest expense of 2 million 

income tax expense decreased 10 million in 2021 and 14 million in 2020 the decrease in 2021 was primarily due to higher amortization of the tcja regulatory liability partially offset by higher earnings the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to higher amortization of the tcja regulatory liability and lower earnings 

outlook — dte gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs dte gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

dte vantage 

the dte vantage segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity and pipelinequality gas from renewable energy projects dte vantage results and outlook are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations increased 258 million in 2021 and decreased 336 million in 2020 the changes are due to the following 





nonutility margin increased 73 million in 2021 and decreased 17 million in 2020 the changes are due to the following 





operation and maintenance expense increased 7 million in 2021 and decreased 34 million in 2020 the 2021 increase was primarily due to higher production and new projects partially offset by closed projects the 2020 decrease was primarily due to 46 million of lower maintenance spending associated with lower production and terminated contracts partially offset by 12 million of costs associated with new projects 

asset gains losses and impairments net changed by 46 million in 2021 from the net gain of 18 million in 2020 and changed by 19 million in 2020 from the net loss of 1 million in 2019 the change in 2021 was primarily due to an asset impairment of 27 million recorded in the steel business for the closure of a pulverized coal facility and 17 million of activity in 2020 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements dispositions and impairments for additional information regarding the 27 million asset impairment 

the change in 2020 was primarily due to to 11 million in the steel business for an asset sale and writeoff of environmental liabilities upon completing site remediation 4 million for the sale of assets in the onsite business and 2 million for the divestiture of a project in the renewables business 

other income and deductions increased 22 million in 2021 and decreased 6 million in 2020 the 2021 increase was primarily due to a 22 million settlement charge associated with a qualified pension plan in the steel business recorded in 2020 the 2021 increase also included higher production in the ref business offset by profit recognized from the sale of membership interests recorded in 2020 

the 2020 decrease was primarily due to the 22 million settlement charge in the steel business and a change in insurance proceeds in the ref and renewables businesses 7 million received in 2019 this decrease was partially offset by 12 million of higher interest income associated with lease transactions in the onsite business and 11 million of profit recognized from the sale of membership interests in the ref business 

income taxes — production tax credits increased by 2 million in 2021 and decreased by 17 million in 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher production partially offset by the sale of membership interests in the ref business the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the sale of membership interests in the ref business 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 1 million in 2021 and decreased by 4 million in 2020 the 2020 decrease was primarily due to lower production in the ref business 

outlook — dte vantage will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy and renewable natural gas projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers beginning in 2022 dte vantage expects decreases in other income and production tax credits that will cause a corresponding reduction to net income as ref facilities will have ceased operations over the longterm dte vantage expects that growth in renewable energy and industrial energy services projects will offset the decreases to net income caused by the ref phaseout dte vantage is also exploring decarbonization opportunities relating to carbon capture and storage projects 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power natural gas and environmental marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power environmental and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers energy trading results and outlook are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations and purchased power and gas — nonutility increased in 2021 primarily due to significantly higher gas prices in the gas structured and gas transportation strategies and decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower gas prices primarily in the gas structured strategy 

nonutility margin decreased by 132 million in 2021 and 17 million in 2020 the change in both periods was primarily due to timing from the unrealized and realized margins presented in the following tables 



 

a natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future andor natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related nonderivative pipeline transportation contract these gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are markedtomarket without revaluing the related nonderivative contracts 

b amount includes 200 million of timing related losses related to gas strategies which will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle 

c amount includes 20 million of timing related losses related to gas strategies recognized in previous periods that reversed as the underlying contracts settled

b amount includes 15 million of timing related losses related to gas strategies which will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle 

c amount includes 10 million of timing related gains related to gas strategies recognized in previous periods that reversed as the underlying contracts settled 

operation and maintenance expense increased 4 million in 2021 and 2 million in 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher compensation costs 

other income and deductions increased 20 million in 2021 primarily due to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations 

outlook — in the nearterm energy trading expects market conditions to remain challenging the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of rtos significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments physical power and natural gas contracts and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas and environmental inventory contracts for pipeline transportation storage assets and some environmental contracts are not derivatives as a result energy trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets energy tradings strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

see also the fair value section herein and notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements fair value and financial and other derivative instruments respectively 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and holds certain investments including funds supporting regional development and economic growth the 2021 net loss of 367 million represents an increase of 288 million from the 2020 net loss of 79 million this increase was primarily due to higher losses on the extinguishment of debt in 2021 following the separation of dt midstream which reduced earnings by 294 million higher net interest expense and a valuation allowance established in 2021 for certain charitable contribution carryforwards the higher loss was also due to the carryback of 2018 net operating losses to 2013 pursuant to the cares act which resulted in a 34 million reduction to income tax expense in 2020 the losses in 2021 were partially offset by the remeasurement of state deferred taxes following the separation of dt midstream which resulted in an 85 million reduction to income tax expense in 2021 

for additional information regarding the loss on extinguishment of debt refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements longterm debt for additional information regarding the remeasurement of state deferred taxes and valuation allowances refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements income taxes 

the 2020 net loss of 79 million represents a decrease of 47 million from the 2019 net loss of 126 million this decrease was primarily due to the 34 million tax adjustment noted above resulting from the cares act the decrease was also due to higher investment earnings in 2020 and the impairment of an equity method investment in 2019 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

dte energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities to grow the nonutility businesses to retire and pay interest on longterm debt and to pay dividends dte energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements dte energy expects that cash from operations in 2022 will be approximately 26 billion dte energy anticipates base level utility capital investments including environmental renewable and energy waste reduction expenditures and expenditures for nonutility businesses of approximately 37 billion in 2022 dte energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

refer below for analysis of cash flows relating to operating investing and financing activities which reflect dte energys change in financial condition any significant noncash items are included in the supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing activities within the the consolidated statements of cash flows 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of dte energys operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric retail access regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

net cash from operations decreased 630 million in 2021 the reduction was primarily due to a decrease in deferred income taxes working capital items and net income adjusted for the loss on extinguishment of debt to reconcile net income to net cash from operating activities the decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization 

net cash from operations increased 10 billion in 2020 the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income depreciation and amortization and cash from tax refunds and working capital items 

the change in working capital items in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease related to accrued pension liability accounts receivable net inventories accrued postretirement liability and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase related to regulatory assets and liabilities accounts payable and derivative assets and liabilities the change in working capital items in 2020 was primarily due to an increase related to accounts receivable net accounts payable and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by a decrease related to prepaid postretirement benefit costs and regulatory assets and liabilities 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions in any given year dte energy looks to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within the nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth dte energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis dte energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria for new business lines dte energy initially invests based on research and analysis dte energy starts with a limited investment evaluates the results and either expands or exits the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of dte energy with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings 

net cash used for investing activities decreased 207 million in 2021 due primarily to decreases in nonutility plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions related to business combinations net of cash acquired partially offset by an increase in utility plant and equipment expenditures 

net cash used for investing activities decreased 17 billion in 2020 due primarily to a decrease in acquisitions related to business combinations net of cash acquired primarily driven by dte energys acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in 2019 for net cash of 23 billion the decrease was also due to lower contributions to equity method investees partially offset by an increase in plant and equipment expenditures 

cash from financing activities 

dte energy relies on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations 

dte energys strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity dte energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from financing activities decreased 481 million in 2021 the decrease was primarily due to an increase in redemption of longterm debt prepayment costs for redemption of longterm debt repurchase of common stock and dividends paid on common stock partially offset by increases in the issuance of longterm debt net of issuance costs and shortterm borrowings net as well as the acquisition related deferred payment made in 2020 

net cash used for financing activities decreased 23 billion in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to to the issuance of equity units and common stock associated with the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in 2019 as well as an increase in cash used for shortterm borrowings net and the acquisition related deferred payment in 2020 these decreases were partially offset by higher cash from the issuance of longterm debt net of issuance costs and lower purchases of noncontrolling interest principally sgg 

outlook 

sources of cash 

dte energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from the utility and nonutility businesses growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined nonutility growth is expected from additional investments in the dte vantage segment dte vantage cash flows are expected to temporarily decrease beginning in 2022 as ref facilities will have ceased operations growth from new renewable energy investments and industrial energy services projects are expected to offset these decreases over the longterm 

dte energys separation of dt midstream will also reduce operating cash flows in the near term however dte energy still expects higher cash flows from operations over the longterm due to the growth of its utilities and other nonutility operations 

dte energys utilities may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future dte energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of longterm capital projects 

to finance the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in december 2019 dte energy issued equity units that will result in the issuance of 13 billion of common stock in november 2022 refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements longterm debt for additional information regarding the equity units dte energy does not anticipate the issuance of any additional equity in 2022 however at the discretion of management and depending upon economic and financial market conditions dte energy could issue additional equity as part of its financial planning process if issued dte energy anticipates these discretionary equity issuances to be made through contributions to the dividend reinvestment plan or employee benefit plans 

over the longterm dte energy does not have any equity commitments other than the 2019 equity units noted above and will continue to evaluate equity needs on an annual basis 

uses of cash 

dte energy has 29 billion in longterm debt including finance leases maturing in the next twelve months repayment of the debt is expected to be made through internally generated funds the issuance or remarketing of new longterm debt or equity issuances associated with the 2019 equity units 

overthe long term dte energys debt and interest obligations have decreased as a result of the separation of dt midstream and dte energys ability to optionally redeem 26 billion of longterm debt during 2021 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements dispositions and impairments for additional information regarding the separation of dt midstream and refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements longterm debt for additional information regarding the optional redemptions as well as dte energys scheduled debt maturities and interest obligations 

dte energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for more than 100 consecutive years and expects to continue paying regular cash dividends in the future including approximately 07 billion in 2022 any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by the board of directors and may depend on dte energys future earnings capital requirements and financial condition over the longterm dte energy expects continued dividend growth and is targeting a payout ratio consistent with pureplay utility companies dividends are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings however these restrictions are not expected to impact dte energys planned dividend payments 

various subsidiaries and equity investees of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as hard triggers state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as soft triggers are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power environmental and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2021 dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was 667 million 

for cash obligations related to leases and future purchase commitments refer to note 17 and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements leases and commitments and contingencies respectively purchase commitments include capital expenditures that are contractually obligated also refer to the capital investments section above for additional information on dte energys capital strategy and estimated spend over the next five years 

other obligations are further detailed in notes 9 10 14 16 18 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters income taxes longterm debt shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings commitments and contingencies and retirement benefits and trusteed assets respectively 

liquidity 

dte energy has approximately 21 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2021 consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all dte energys businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows 

credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and dte vantage segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

the separation of dt midstream has resulted in a shift in dte energys strategy to a predominately pureplay utility but to date has not had any impact on dte energys credit ratings since the announcement of the planned separation in october 2020 and completed separation in july 2021 standard and poors global ratings fitch ratings and moodys investor service have all affirmed the ratings and stable outlook of dte energy dte electric and dte gas 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the registrants consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements the registrants management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

a significant portion of the registrants businesses are subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses the registrants management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters 

derivatives 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2021 and 2020 the registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values the registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the registrants estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices the registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts see the sensitivity analysis in item 7a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements fair value and financial and other derivative instruments respectively 

goodwill 

certain of dte energys reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations dte energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in performing the impairment test dte energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit an impairment loss would be recognized a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

dte energy estimates the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit for certain reporting units the fair values were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows and the market approach which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries the income approach includes a terminal value that utilizes an assumed longterm growth rate approach which incorporates managements assumptions regarding sustainable longterm growth of the reporting units the income approach cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance 

one of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies management selects comparable peers based on each peer’s primary business mix operations and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of the test date 

dte energy performs an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests dte energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while dte energy believes the assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact dte energys earnings 

dte energy performed its annual impairment test as of october 1 2021 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed 

the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the october 1 2021 valuation date 



 

a percentage by which the fair value of equity of the reporting unit would need to decline to equal its carrying value including goodwill 

b discounted cash flows dcf incorporated 20222026 projected cash flows plus a calculated terminal value for each of the reporting units dte energy capitalized the terminal year cash flows at the weighted average costs of capital wacc less an assumed longterm growth rate of 20 management applied equal weighting to the dcf and market multiples analysis where applicable to determine the fair value of the respective reporting units 

c due to lack of market comparable information for the dte vantage and energy trading reporting units dte energy did not perform a market multiples analysis 

longlived assets 

the registrants evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require the registrants to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact their earnings 

pension and other postretirement costs 

dte energy sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the registrants the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required dte energy considers historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

dte energy had pension costs of 139 million in 2021 148 million in 2020 and 112 million in 2019 other postretirement benefit credits were 59 million in 2021 49 million in 2020 and 1 million in 2019 pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for 2021 were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 700 for the pension plans and 670 for the other postretirement benefit plans in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumptions dte energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets dte energys 2022 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 29 in equity markets 48 in fixed income markets including long duration bonds and 23 invested in other assets dte energys 2022 expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 22 in equity markets 54 in fixed income markets and 24 invested in other assets because of market volatility dte energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate dte energy is lowering its longterm rate of return assumption for the pension plans to 680 and lowering the other postretirement plans to 640 for 2022 dte energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rates of return on the plans assets for 2022 given their respective asset allocations and dte energys capital market expectations dte energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions including its expected rate of return at least annually 

dte energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for the pension plans dte energy uses a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized favorable asset performance in 2021 resulted in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2021 dte energy had 241 million of cumulative gains related to investment performance in prior years that were not yet recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for other postretirement benefit plans dte energy uses fair value when determining the mrv of plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that dte energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans the discount rate determined on this basis was 291 for both the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2021 compared to 257 and 258 respectively for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2020 

dte energy changed the mortality assumptions as of december 31 2021 to reflect the updated projection scale published by the society of actuaries the mortality assumptions used at december 31 2021 are the pri2012 mortality table projected to 2018 using scale mp2019 and projected forward from 2018 using scale mp2021 with generational projection the base mortality tables vary by type of plan employees union status and employment status with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population 

dte energy estimates that total pension costs will be approximately 30 million in 2022 compared to 139 million in 2021 the expected decrease is primarily due to a higher discount rate and continued recognition of asset returns greater than expected the 2022 other postretirement benefit credit is estimated at approximately 65 million compared to 59 million in 2021 the expected increase in the credit is primarily due to a higher discount rate 

the health care trend rates for dte energy assume 675 for pre65 participants and 725 for post65 participants for 2022 trending down to 450 for both pre65 and post65 participants in 2034 

future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2021 pension costs by approximately 48 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2021 pension costs by approximately 22 million lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2021 other postretirement credit by approximately 20 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased the 2021 other postretirement credit by approximately 17 million 

the value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 75 billion at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 at december 31 2021 dte energys qualified pension plans were underfunded by 201 million and its other postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by 319 million in 2021 the funded status of the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans improved due to favorable asset returns and an increase in discount rates 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets dte energy did not make contributions to its qualified pension plans in 2021 and made contributions of 92 million in 2020 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to 7 million in 2022 and up to 23 million over the next five years in addition dte energy anticipates transferring 50 million of qualified pension plan funds from dte gas to dte electric in 2022 dte energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2021 or 2020 dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement plans in 2022 or over the next five years the planned pension contributions will be made in cash andor dte energy common stock

legal reserves 

the registrants are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon the registrants management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the registrants 

accounting for tax obligations 

the registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold the registrants also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the consolidated financial statements the registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2021 and 2020 are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the registrants consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts dte energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power natural gas some environmental contracts and certain forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items dte energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory pipeline transportation contracts storage assets and some environmental contracts see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements fair value and financial and other derivative instruments respectively 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and some environmental contracts which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in the registrants reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the registrants manage their mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

the electric and gas businesses have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of coal natural gas uranium and electricity however the registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales and transportation services revenue at the gas segment the gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the registrants are exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

the dte vantage segment is subject to price risk for electricity natural gas coal products and environmental attributes generated from its renewable natural gas investments dte energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of longterm contracts and hedging instruments when available 

dte energys energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas environmental crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the registrants regularly review contingent matters existing and future economic conditions customer trends and other factors relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts the registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss 

trading activities 

dte energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations dte energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties 

the following table displays the credit quality of dte energys trading counterparties as of december 31 2021 



 

a this category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of baa3 assigned by moody’s investors service moody’s or bbb assigned by standard  poor’s rating group a division of mcgrawhill companies inc standard  poor’s the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented 10 of the total gross credit exposure 

b this category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented less than 1 of the total gross credit exposure 

c this category includes counterparties that have not been rated by moody’s or standard  poor’s but are considered investment grade based on dte energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented 18 of the total gross credit exposure 

d this category includes counterparties that have not been rated by moody’s or standard  poor’s and are considered noninvestment grade based on dte energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented 2 of the total gross credit exposure 

other 

the registrants engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade the registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt in order to manage interest costs dte energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements dte energys exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and other applicable shortterm reference rates as of december 31 2021 dte energy had floating rate debt of 758 million and a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of 42 

foreign currency exchange risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit dte energys exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations dte energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through june 2030 

summary of sensitivity analyses 

sensitivity analyses were performed on the fair values of commodity contracts for dte energy and longterm debt obligations for the registrants the commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at december 31 2021 and 2020 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values the hypothetical losses related to longterm debt would be realized only if dte energy transferred all of its fixedrate longterm debt to other creditors

electric 

description 

dte energys electric segment consists principally of dte electric an electric utility engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 22 million customers in southeastern michigan dte electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and egle electricity is generated from fossilfuel plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant a nuclear plant wind and other renewable assets and is supplemented with purchased power the electricity is sold or distributed through the retail access program to three major classes of customers residential commercial and industrial throughout southeastern michigan 

weather economic factors competition energy waste reduction initiatives and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers dte electrics peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands dte electrics operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte electric 

the electric segment also consists of nonutility operations relating to renewable energy projects at dte sustainable generation these projects have been acquired in support of dte energys renewable energy goals 

for a summary of electric segment operating revenues by service see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report revenue 

fuel supply and purchased power 

dte electrics power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power dte electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers dte electrics generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms dte electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases dte electric has longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 14 million tons of lowsulfur western coal and approximately 4 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2021 to 2023 all of these contracts have pricing schedules dte electric has purchase commitments for approximately 77 of the expected coal requirements for 2021 dte electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western and eastern coal rail requirements under multiyear contracts the companys 2021 rail transportation is covered under longterm agreements the company expects to cover all of its 2021 vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities through existing and new agreements given the geographic diversity of supply dte electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso dte electric offers its generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load dte electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance that qualifying customers receive dte electric works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte electric also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to customers 

strategy and competition 

dte electrics electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner and support dte energys goal to reduce carbon emissions with potential capacity constraints in the miso region there will be increased dependency on dte electrics generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers to meet the generation needs and carbon reduction goals continuing investments will be made in renewable resources a natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility and dte electrics primary coal generation fleet and nuclear generating plant 

dte electrics distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to customers dte electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

the electric retail access program in michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan in 2008 and 2016 has placed a 10 cap on total retail access this cap mitigates some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on dte electrics financial performance and full service customer rates customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers and represented approximately 85 10 and 10 of retail sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in retail access sales in 2020 was primarily due to a large customer shutting down operations dte electric expects incremental customers to move into the retail access program and for sales to return to approximately 10 in 2021 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers dte electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

gas 

description 

dte energys gas segment consists principally of dte gas a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity 

dte gas natural gas sales enduser transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of the business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and dte gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in annual average customer usage are minimized by the rdm 

dte gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte gas 

for a summary of gas segment operating revenues by service see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report revenue 

natural gas supply 

dte gas gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 26 bcf with approximately 66 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2020 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity dte gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements dte gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

dte gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify dte gas natural gas supply base natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas appalachian gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpscapproved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2023 

dte gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the appalachian gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions the primary longterm transportation supply contracts at december 31 2020 are listed below 



properties 

dte gas owns distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan the distribution system includes approximately 20000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1308000 service pipelines and approximately 1305000 active meters dte gas also owns approximately 2000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect dte gas storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

dte gas owns storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 139 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to dte gas customers in addition dte gas sells storage services to third parties 

most of dte gas distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by dte gas through easements permits or licenses substantially all of dte gas property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

dte gas leases a portion of its pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a finance lease arrangement see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report leases 

regulation 

dte gas is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte gas mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on investments dte gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to a mpscapproved tariff 

dte gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the fercs jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by dte gas in interstate markets ferc granted dte gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates dte gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc 

dte gas is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 10 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report regulatory matters and commitments and contingencies 

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte gas ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte gas uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive dte gas works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte gas also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to dte gas customers 

strategy and competition 

dte gas strategy is to ensure the safe reliable and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in michigan in addition dte gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to underserved markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces water heaters and appliances within its current customer base dte gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy waste reduction products and services to its customers making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for enduser transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for dte gas enduser transportation service dte gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by its storage capacity 

having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of dte gas storage and transportation services to gas producers marketers distribution companies enduser customers and other pipeline companies the business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

 item 1a risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of the registrants utility businesses and dte energys nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the registrants below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses although the registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect performance 

regulatory legislative and legal risks 

the registrants are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization the registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies the registrants ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations regulators may also disagree with the registrants rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business if the registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact the registrants ability to recover certain costs through customer rates regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for the registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers the registrants cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how the business operates impact the registrants ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery or require the registrants to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric retail access program could negatively impact the registrants financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for dte electric customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes the registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity 

environmental laws and liability may be costly the registrants are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in the registrants generation fleet and for dte energys gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require the registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals the registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally the registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body the registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

the registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulations of ghg emissions are implemented the operations of dte electrics fossilfueled generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process the registrants financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

for dte energy future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of dte energys gas transportation businesses 

the renewable portfolio standard and energy waste reduction may affect the registrants business and federal and state fuel standards may affect dte energys nonutility investments the registrants are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy the registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future in addition the registrants expect to comply with new michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

in addition the registrants are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the registrants revenues as customers decrease their energy usage the registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results 

dte energys nonutility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal renewable fuel standard and californias low carbon fuel standard changes to these standards may affect dte energys business and result in lower earnings 

dte energys ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources the registrants generated production tax credits from renewable energy generation and dte energy generated production tax credits from renewable gas recovery reduced emission fuel and gas production operations if the registrants production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit or changes in tax law there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the registrants earnings and cash flows 

operational risks 

the registrants electric distribution system and dte energys gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation which could reduce revenues increase expenses and have a material adverse effect on their business financial position and results of operations the registrants electric distribution and dte energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks these operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years equipment even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices is subject to operational failure including events that are beyond the registrants control and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently because the registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of the registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties 

construction and capital improvements to the registrants power facilities dte energys distribution systems and its gas storage and pipelines business subject them to risk the registrants are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at the registrants multiple power generation and distribution facilities at dte energys gas distribution system and at dte energys gas storage and pipelines business many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the registrants control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals including required certificates from regulatory agencies construction disputes impediments to acquiring rightsofway or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms cost overruns and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the registrants financial performance operations or expected investment returns at the affected facilities businesses and development projects 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects the registrants to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the registrants to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options insurance maintained by the registrants for various nuclearrelated risks may not be sufficient to cover the registrants costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant which may affect the registrants financial performance in addition the registrants nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning a decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the registrants’ liquidity financial position or results of operations 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact the registrants financial results the registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations dte energys access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers dte energys nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts dte electric charges utility customers for electricity and dte gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of dte energys nonutility businesses the registrants hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for dte energys nonutility businesses particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers as well as midstream services that depend on the demand for natural gas 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact the registrants financial results  the registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of their facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the registrants utility products and for dte energy on the profitability of the nonutility businesses 

weather significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the registrants earnings and cash flows mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the registrants assets lowering income and cash flows at dte electric ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weatherrelated issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance the registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation the registrants financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs 

a work interruption may adversely affect the registrants there are several bargaining units for dte energys approximately 5200 and dte electrics approximately 2800 represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2021 and 2022 a union choosing to strike would have an impact on the registrants businesses the registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance 

financial economic and market risks 

dte energys nonutility businesses may not perform to its expectations dte energy relies on nonutility operations for a significant portion of earnings if dte energys current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels dte energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value 

adverse changes in the registrants credit ratings may negatively affect them regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in the registrants economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in the registrants credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in the registrants credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact their liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the registrants liquidity and results of operations the registrants costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and the registrants required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the registrants plans the registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below the registrants projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the registrants utility customers the results of operations and financial position of the registrants could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets the registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the registrants cash flows financial position or results of operations 

the registrants ability to access capital markets is important the registrants ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain the registrants ability as well as the ability of their subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the registrants access to capital markets the registrants longterm revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2024 but the registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the registrants utilities and dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the registrants  advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include costeffective renewable energy technologies distributed generation energy waste reduction technologies and energy storage devices such developments may impact the price of energy may affect energy deliveries as customerowned generation becomes more costeffective may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply andor distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy each of these factors could materially affect the registrants’ results of operations cash flows or financial position 

dte energys participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations dte energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed dte energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose dte energy to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks dte energys trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines dte energy sets resulting from the management of dte energys business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish dte energys financial results and financial position dte energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

regional national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the registrants the registrants utility and dte energys nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with should the financial conditions of some of dte energys significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional national or international economic conditions reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services dte energy supplies collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows 

if dte energys goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it may be required to record a charge to earnings dte energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment goodwill and other intangible assets are also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization slower industry growth rates or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows dte energy cannot predict the timing strength or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery if the carrying value of any goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be not recoverable dte energy may take a noncash impairment charge which could materially impact dte energys results of operations and financial position 

the registrants may not be fully covered by insurance the registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters war terrorism cyber incidents or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the registrants operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or the registrants insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations 

safety and security risks 

the registrants businesses have safety risks the registrants electric distribution system power plants renewable energy equipment and other facilities and dte energys gas distribution system gas infrastructure and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury death or property loss to employees customers third parties or the public although the registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident they could experience financial loss damage to their reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

threats of cyber incidents physical security and terrorism could affect the registrants business issues may threaten the registrants such as cyber incidents physical security or terrorism that may disrupt the registrants operations and could harm the registrants operating results 

information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches the registrants industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents physical security threats acts of war or terrorism and other causes as well as loss of operational control of the registrants electric generation and distribution assets and dte energys gas distribution assets if the registrants information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way the registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business operating results and financial condition 

suppliers vendors contractors and information technology providers have access to systems that support the registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data a breach of these thirdparty systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system also  because the registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility electric generator system operator or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the registrants’ businesses operating results and financial condition 

in addition the registrants generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and dte energys gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products the registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the registrants cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the registrants in connection with the registrants businesses they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers shareholders and employees customers shareholders and employees expect that the registrants will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the registrants reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

general and other risks 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect the 

registrants businesses and operations the covid19 pandemic is currently impacting countries communities supply chains 

and markets the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus such as quarantines closures or reduced 

operations of businesses governmental agencies and other institutions have caused a recession resulting in disruptions in various public commercial and industrial activities and have caused employee absences which interfered with certain operation and maintenance of the registrants facilities travel bans and restrictions quarantines and shelter in place orders could also cause us to experience operational delays delay the delivery of critical infrastructure and other supplies we source globally or delay the connection of electric or gas service to new customers and have reduced the use of electricity and gas by certain customers in the commercial and industrial segments certain of our businesses have experienced lower sales volumes and any of the foregoing circumstances could further adversely affect customer demand or revenues impact the ability of the registrants suppliers vendors or contractors to perform or cause other unpredictable events which could adversely affect the registrants businesses results of operations or financial condition the continued spread of covid19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the financial markets which could increase the registrants costs to fund capital requirements and impact the operating results of our energy trading operations to the extent that the registrants access to the capital markets is adversely affected by covid19 the registrants may need to consider alternative sources of funding for our operations and for working capital any of which could increase the registrants cost of capital the extent to which covid19 may impact the registrants liquidity financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information concerning the severity of covid19 and related variants vaccine distribution and other actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions can resume among others our business continuity plans and insurance coverage may be insufficient to mitigate these adverse impacts to our business in addition the registrants’ may be required to suspend shut offs for certain customers which may adversely impact the registrants’ collections process and have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the registrants ’ operations the registrants businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the registrants business and future operating results in addition the registrants have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations 

dte energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from the utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

the proposed spinoff of dte midstream the proposed spinoff may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits the proposed spinoff if completed may also present additional risk to dte energy the proposed spinoff is subject to conditions including without limitation final dte energy board of directors approval unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions may delay the proposed spinoff and the proposed spinoff may not occur on the currently contemplated timeline or at all dte energy cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed spinoff will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved if at all furthermore there are various uncertainties and risks relating to the process of the proposed spinoff that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows including disruption of our operations and impairment of our relationship with regulators key personnel customers and vendors if the proposed spinoff is successfully completed dte energy will face new and unique risks including having fewer assets reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources which may adversely impact dte energys financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the changes in our operational and financial profile may not meet some or all of our shareholders investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their dte energy shares and otherwise decrease demand for shares of dte energy common stock excess selling will cause the relative market price of dte energy common stock to decrease and the market price of dte energy common stock may be subject to greater volatility following the completion of the proposed spinoff 

while dte energy does not expect its credit ratings from standard  poors rating service moodys investor service and fitch ratings inc to drop below investment grade as a result of completing the proposed spinoff there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain such investment grade credit ratings in the future if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners 

the distribution of shares of the new midstream company dt midstream to dte energy shareholders in the proposed spinoff is expected to qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code however if the irs determined on audit that the distribution is taxable both dte energy and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

following the proposed spinoff the management and directors each of dte energy and dt midstream may own common stock in both companies and robert skaggs jr who will be a member of dt midstreams board also serves on dte energys board and may be required to recuse himself from deliberations relating to arrangements between dte energy and dt midstream in the future this ownership and directorship overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other company potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that dte energy and dt midstream may enter into in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following combined discussion is separately filed by dte energy and dte electric however dte electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to dte energy or the subsidiaries of dte energy other than itself 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2020 operating revenues of approximately 122 billion and total assets of approximately 455 billion dte energy is the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan dte energy also operates three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes dte energys financial results 



the increase in 2020 net income attributable to dte energy company was primarily due to higher earnings in the electric gas storage and pipelines and corporate and other segments partially offset by lower earnings in the energy trading segment the increase in 2019 net income attributable to dte energy company was due to higher earnings in the electric gas energy trading and corporate and other segments partially offset by lower earnings in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

covid19 pandemic 

during the first quarter of 2020 the covid19 pandemic began impacting michigan and other service territories throughout the united states in which the registrants operate dte energy took certain safety precautions including directing employees to work remotely whenever possible and pausing all noncritical business activities the spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus resulted in closures and reduced operations of businesses governmental agencies and other institutions beginning in may 2020 dte energy resumed business activities that had been temporarily suspended local businesses and other institutions also resumed operations as new cases of covid19 began to decline and government restrictions were reduced 

impacts from the covid19 pandemic have included a reduction in sales volumes from commercial and industrial customers and an increase in sales volumes from residential customers within the electric segment covid19 has also impacted the power and industrial projects segment contributing to lower production in the ref business and lower demand in the steel business 

operation and maintenance expense has been impacted by covid19 primarily in the electric segment due to higher costs for personal protective equipment and other health and safetyrelated costs including shift premiums and related expenses associated with the sequestration of certain employees critical to continued operations the registrants implemented certain cost savings initiatives to offset some of these impacts to the extent they did not affect safety or reliability of service to date impacts from the covid19 pandemic have not had a material effect on the registrants uncollectible expense or capital spend 

in addition the cares act was signed into law in march 2020 to assist individuals and employers with the impacts of the covid19 pandemic this legislation resulted in various tax impacts to the registrants refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report income taxes for additional information 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the results of operations section below including impacts from the covid19 pandemic where applicable also refer to the capital resources and liquidity section for information on the impact of covid19 on the registrants liquidity and cost of capital 

strategy 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

dte energys utilities are investing capital to improve customer reliability through investments in base infrastructure and new generation and to comply with environmental requirements dte energy expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte energy is focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability dte energy operates in a constructive regulatory environment and has solid relationships with its regulators 

dte energy is committed to reduce the carbon emissions of its electric utility operations by 32 by 2023 50 by 2030 and 80 by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels dte energy is also committed to a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for its electric utility gas utility and dte midstream operations to achieve the reduction goals in the near term dte energy will transition away from coalpowered sources and incorporate more renewable energy energy waste reduction projects demand response and natural gas fueled generation dte energy has already begun the transition in the way it produces power through the continued retirement of its aging coalfired plants refer to the capital investments section below for further discussion 

dte energy has significant investments in nonutility businesses dte energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets skills and expertise and provides diversity in earnings and geography specifically dte energy invests in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile dte energy expects growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments these opportunities would be limited to power and industrial projects if dte energy completes the planned spinoff of the dte midstream business and shifts its strategy to a predominantly pureplay utility as discussed in the outlook section below 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity dte energy has an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

dte energys utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

dte electrics capital investments over the 20212025 period are estimated at 14 billion comprised of 5 billion for capital replacements and other projects 7 billion for distribution infrastructure and 2 billion for renewable generation dte electric has retired five coalfired generation units at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities and has announced plans to retire its remaining twelve coalfired generating units river rouges final unit will retire in 2021 and five additional coalfired generating units at trenton channel and st clair will be retired in 2022 the remaining coalfired generating units at the belle river and monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040 the retired facilities will be replaced with renewables energy waste reduction demand response and natural gas fueled generation 

dte gas capital investments over the 20212025 period are estimated at 3 billion comprised of 14 billion for base infrastructure and 16 billion for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs 

dte electric and dte gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment 

dte energys nonutility businesses capital investments are primarily for expansion growth and ongoing maintenance gas storage and pipelines capital investments over the 20212025 period are estimated at 12 billion to 17 billion for gathering and pipeline investments and expansions power and industrial projects capital investments over the 20212025 period are estimated at 1 billion to 14 billion for industrial energy services and renewable energy projects 

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially the registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers as authorized by the mpsc 

see items 1 and 2 business and properties and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report commitments and contingencies for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry dte energys strong utility base combined with its integrated nonutility operations position it well for longterm growth 

looking forward dte energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance 

• electric and gas customer satisfaction 

• electric distribution system reliability 

• new electric generation 

• gas distribution system renewal 

• rate competitiveness and affordability 

• regulatory stability and investment recovery for the electric and gas utilities 

• employee safety and engagement 

• cost structure optimization across all business segments 

• cash capital and liquidity to maintain or improve financial strength and 

• investments that integrate assets and leverage skills and expertise 

in addition on october 27 2020 dte energy announced its intention to spinoff the dte midstream business reflecting a shift in strategy to a predominantly pureplay utility dte energy expects to complete the separation by midyear 2021 subject to final approval by its board of directors and satisfaction of other conditions if the spinoff transaction is completed it would result in a reduction to dte energys earnings and cash flows however dte energy would remain wellpositioned for longterm growth and focused on the key objectives noted above dte energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic financial and risk criteria 

covid19 pandemic 

dte energy will continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on supply chains markets counterparties and customers and any related impacts on the operating costs customer demand and recoverability of assets in our business segments that could materially impact the registrants financial results 

dte energy expects reduced electric demand from commercial and industrial customers and increased demand from residential customers to continue as long as businesses maintain more remote operations operation and maintenance expenses will also continue to be impacted in the near term by the need for personal protective equipment and other safetyrelated costs 

dte energy will continue to review the allowance for doubtful accounts for any additional risk related to covid19 and will monitor any potential challenges to demand in the power and industrial projects segment dte energy will also continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of any regulatory and legislative activities related to the covid19 pandemic refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters for further information on current regulatory issues 

the registrants cannot predict the ultimate impact of these factors to our consolidated financial statements as future developments involving covid19 and related impacts on economic and operating conditions are highly uncertain for further discussion of these uncertainties refer to risk factors in item 1a of this report 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as the nongaap financial measures utility margin and nonutility margin discussed below which dte energy uses as measures of its operational performance generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

dte energy uses utility margin and nonutility margin nongaap financial measures to assess its performance by reportable segment 

utility margin includes electric utility and gas utility operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses the utilities’ fuel purchased power and natural gas supply are passed through to customers and therefore result in changes to the utilities’ revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses as such dte energy believes utility margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the utilities’ operations across periods as it excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses for the electric segment nonutility operating revenues are reported separately so that utility margin can be used to assess utility performance 

the nonutility margin relates to the power and industrial projects and energy trading segments for the power and industrial projects segment nonutility margin primarily includes operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses operating revenues include sales of refined coal to third parties and the affiliated electric utility metallurgical coke and related byproducts petroleum coke renewable natural gas and related credits and electricity as well as rental income and revenues from utilitytype consulting management and operational services for the energy trading segment nonutility margin includes revenue and realized and unrealized gains and losses from physical and financial power and gas marketing optimization and trading activities net of purchased power and gas related to these activities dte energy evaluates its operating performance of these nonutility businesses using the measure of operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses 

utility margin and nonutility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap utility margin and nonutility margin do not intend to represent operating income the most comparable gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of dte energys segments segment information described below includes intercompany revenues and expenses and other income and deductions that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 



electric 

the results of operations discussion for dte electric is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with general instruction i 2 a of form 10k for whollyowned subsidiaries 

the electric segment consists principally of dte electric electric results and outlook are discussed below 



see dte electrics consolidated statements of operations in item 8 of this report for a complete view of its results differences between the electric segment and dte electrics consolidated statements of operations are primarily due to nonutility operations at dte sustainable generation and the classification of certain benefit costs refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements retirement benefits and trusteed assets for additional information 

utility margin increased 283 million in 2020 and 91 million in 2019 revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the registrants consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





 

a represents power that is not distributed by dte electric 

b represents deliveries for selfgenerators that have purchased power from alternative energy suppliers to supplement their power requirements 

dte electric sales volumes decreased in 2020 primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on customers sales volumes decreased for commercial and industrial customers partially offset by an increase in residential sales the net decrease to dte electric sales volumes was also partially offset by slightly favorable weather in 2020 compared to 2019 

operating revenues — nonutility operations increased 9 million in 2020 and 5 million in 2019 the increase in both periods was due to renewable energy projects acquired by dte sustainable generation in september 2019 and january 2020 

operation and maintenance expense increased 55 million in 2020 and decreased 3 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to covid19 related expenses of 50 million associated with the health and safety of employees higher benefits expense of 15 million higher ewr program expense of 11 million higher rps program expense of 9 million and an 11 million adjustment in 2019 to defer expenses previously accrued for a new customer billing system these increases were partially offset by lower generation expense of 25 million and lower distribution expense of 12 million 

the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to lower uncollectible expense of 19 million an 11 million deferral of expenses previously accrued for a new customer billing system and decreased generation expense of 3 million these decreases were partially offset by higher tree trim expense of 20 million tree trim expenses increased by 63 million but were offset by amounts deferred to a regulatory asset of 43 million and higher rps program expense of 11 million 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 108 million in 2020 and 113 million in 2019 in 2020 the increase was primarily due to a 108 million increase resulting from a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective may 2019 and a 10 million increase resulting from new nonutility assets at dte sustainable generation partially offset by a decrease of 11 million associated with the trm in 2019 the increase was primarily due to a 126 million increase resulting from a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective may 2019 and a 4 million increase resulting from new nonutility assets at dte sustainable generation partially offset by a decrease of 17 million associated with the trm 

taxes other than income decreased 14 million in 2020 and increased 4 million in 2019 in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to lower property taxes of 9 million as a result of a property tax settlement and lower payroll taxes of 3 million which was primarily attributable to employee retention credits recognized pursuant to the cares act in 2019 the increase was primarily due to a 2 million tax reserve released in 2018 higher property taxes of 1 million and a 1 million increase resulting from new nonutility assets at dte sustainable generation 

asset gains losses and impairments net increased 28 million in 2020 and 14 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to a 41 million writeoff of capital expenditures related to incentive compensation which were disallowed in the may 8 2020 rate order from the mpsc compared to losses of 13 million in 2019 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to previously recorded capital expenditures of 13 million that were disallowed in the may 2 2019 rate order 

other income and deductions increased 81 million in 2020 and decreased 26 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to a change in investment earnings loss of 3 million in 2020 compared to a gain of 37 million in 2019 30 million of contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations and 22 million of higher interest expense these increases were partially offset by a 2019 accrual of 6 million associated with an environmentalrelated settlement the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to a change in investment earnings gain of 37 million in 2019 compared to a loss of 11 million in 2018 and lower nonoperating retirement benefits expense of 12 million partially offset by higher interest expense of 32 million 

income tax expense decreased 29 million in 2020 and 56 million in 2019 the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to higher amortization of the tcja regulatory liability and higher production tax credits partially offset by higher earnings the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to tcja regulatory liability amortization of 35 million and higher production tax credits 

outlook — dte electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while keeping customer rate increases affordable looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and effects of energy waste reduction programs 

dte electric is also monitoring the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on future operations and financial results refer to the executive overview and outlook sections above for dte energys consideration of covid19 impacts on our business segments 

gas 

the gas segment consists principally of dte gas gas results and outlook are discussed below 



utility margin increased 3 million in 2020 and 65 million in 2019 revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in dte energys consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





sales changes are primarily due to more unfavorable weather in 2020 compared to 2019 and more favorable weather in 2019 compared to 2018 intermediate transportation volumes fluctuate based on available market opportunities 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 19 million in 2020 and increased 13 million in 2019 the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower gas operations expense of 36 million partially offset by higher ewr program expenses of 7 million higher corporate overhead costs of 3 million and a 6 million adjustment in 2019 to defer expenses previously accrued for a new customer billing system the increase in 2019 was primarily due to higher gas operations expenses of 22 million higher customer service costs and related administrative expenses of 7 million and higher ewr expenses of 2 million partially offset by decreased uncollectible expense of 14 million and a 6 million adjustment in 2019 to defer expenses previously accrued for a new customer billing system 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 13 million in 2020 and 11 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective october 2020 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to a higher depreciable base 

taxes other than income increased 4 million in 2020 and 7 million in 2019 the 2020 increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 8 million partially offset by lower payroll taxes of 3 million which was primarily attributable to employee retention credits recognized pursuant to the cares act the 2019 increase was primarily due to higher property taxes 

asset gains losses and impairments net increased 14 million in 2020 primarily due to the writeoff of capital expenditures related to incentive compensation which were disallowed in the july 17 2020 rate case settlement 

other income and deductions increased 4 million in 2020 and 4 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to lower investments earnings of 2 million and higher interest expense of 2 million the increase in 2019 was primarily due to higher interest expense of 8 million partially offset by lower contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations of 6 million 

income tax expense decreased 14 million in 2020 and 5 million in 2019 the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to higher amortization of the tcja regulatory liability and lower earnings the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the absence of a 10 million tcja expense recorded in 2018 partially offset by higher earnings 

outlook — dte gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs dte gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

dte gas filed a rate case with the mpsc on february 12 2021 requesting an increase in base rates of 195 million based on a projected twelvemonth period ending december 31 2022 the requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments and operating and maintenance expenses the rate filing also requested an increase in return on equity from 99 to 1025 and includes projected changes in sales and working capital a final mpsc order in this case is expected by december 2021 

dte gas is also monitoring the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on future operations and financial results refer to the executive overview and outlook sections above for dte energys consideration of covid19 impacts on our business segments 

gas storage and pipelines 

the gas storage and pipelines segment consists of the nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses gas storage and pipelines results and outlook are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations increased 253 million in 2020 and 16 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher pipeline and gathering revenues from the first full year of blue union as well as the leap pipeline which was placed inservice during the third quarter 2020 these increases were partially offset by lower physical sales of gas from ags customers and lower storage revenues the 2019 increase was primarily due to one month of activity for blue union in december 2019 and the first full year of birdsboro pipeline operations 

cost of sales — nonutility increased 3 million in 2020 and decreased 4 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to the first full year of blue union partially offset by lower physical purchases of gas from ags customers the decrease in 2019 was driven primarily by lower physical purchases of gas from ags customers 

operation and maintenance expense increased 31 million in 2020 and 17 million in 2019 the 2020 increase was primarily due to the first full year of blue union and transaction costs related to the planned spinoff of dte midstream partially offset by cost savings initiatives the 2019 increase was primarily due to transaction costs associated with the blue union and leap acquisition and higher laborrelated expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 57 million in 2020 and 12 million in 2019 the 2020 increase was primarily due to the first full year of blue union the 2019 increase was primarily due to additional pipeline and gathering assets placed into service during the year 

taxes other than income increased 7 million in 2020 primarily related to property taxes incurred during the first full year of blue union 

other income and deductions decreased 9 million in 2020 and 27 million in 2019 the 2020 decrease was primarily due to interest expense related to the blue union acquisition partially offset by a postacquisition settlement of 20 million and higher earnings from pipeline investments the 2019 decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from pipeline investments and higher interest expense 

income tax expense increased 42 million in 2020 and 6 million in 2019 the 2020 increase was primarily due to higher earnings the 2019 increase was primarily due to tax impacts from placing the nexus pipeline inservice in late 2018 partially offset by lower earnings 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 4 million in 2020 and 12 million in 2019 the decrease in both periods was primarily due to the may 2019 purchase of an additional 30 ownership interest in sgg 

outlook — dte energy believes its longterm agreements with producers and the quality of the natural gas reserves in the marcellusutica and haynesville shale regions soundly position the business for future revenues gas storage and pipelines will continue to execute quality investments with a focus on continued organic growth from wellpositioned existing assets 

recent declines in commodity prices can have a negative impact on customers of gas storage and pipelines if sustained for an extended period dte energy continues to work with its customers by executing short medium and longterm storage gathering and transportation contracts 

on october 27 2020 dte energy announced that its board of directors has authorized management to pursue a plan to spinoff the dte midstream business dte energy expects to complete the separation by midyear 2021 subject to final approval by its board of directors and satisfaction of other conditions

power and industrial projects 

the power and industrial projects segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity and pipelinequality gas from renewable energy projects power and industrial projects results and outlook are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations decreased 336 million in 2020 and 644 million in 2019 the changes are due to the following 



nonutility margin decreased 17 million in 2020 and increased 24 million in 2019 the changes are due to the following 



operation and maintenance expense decreased 34 million in 2020 and 35 million in 2019 the 2020 decrease was primarily due to 46 million of lower maintenance spending associated with lower production and terminated contracts partially offset by 12 million of costs associated with new projects the 2019 decrease was primarily due to 33 million associated with the sale of membership interests in the ref business and 9 million of lower spend in the renewables business primarily due to an expired contract partially offset by 7 million of higher maintenance spend in the steel business 

asset gains losses and impairments net increased 19 million in 2020 from the net loss of 1 million in 2019 and increased by 26 million in 2019 from the net loss of 27 million in 2018 the 2020 increase was primarily due to 11 million in the steel business for an asset sale and the writeoff of environmental liabilities upon completing site remediation 4 million for the sale of assets in the onsite business and 2 million for the divestiture of a project in the renewables business 

the 2019 increase was primarily due to higher losses incurred in 2018 including a 15 million liability adjustment related to contingent consideration and an 8 million asset writeoff in the renewables business in anticipation of a contract ending in 2020 

other income and deductions decreased 6 million in 2020 and increased 37 million in 2019 the 2020 decrease was primarily due to a 22 million settlement charge associated with a qualified pension plan in the steel business and a change in insurance proceeds in the ref and renewables businesses 7 million received in 2019 this decrease was partially offset by 12 million of higher interest income associated with lease transactions in the onsite business and 11 million of profit recognized from the sale of membership interests in the ref business the 2019 increase was primarily due to the sale of membership interests in the ref business and higher equity earnings at various projects 

income taxes — production tax credits decreased by 17 million in 2020 and 105 million in 2019 the decrease in both periods was primarily due to the sale of membership interests in the ref business 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 4 million in 2020 and 17 million in 2019 the 2020 decrease was primarily due to lower production in the ref business the 2019 decrease was primarily due to the sale of membership interests in the ref business 

outlook — power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy and renewable natural gas projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers in addition to optimizing the ref facilities until the phaseout at the end of 2021 beginning in 2022 power and industrial projects expects decreases in other income and production tax credits that will cause a corresponding reduction to net income as ref facilities will cease operations over the longterm power and industrial projects expects that growth in industrial energy services projects and renewable energy projects will offset the decreases to net income caused by the ref phaseout 

power and industrial projects is also monitoring all other impacts from the covid19 pandemic on future operations and financial results refer to the executive overview and outlook sections above for dte energys consideration of covid19 impacts on our business segments 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power natural gas and environmental marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power environmental and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers energy trading results and outlook are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations and purchased power and gas — nonutility were impacted by a decrease in gas prices for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 primarily in the gas structured strategy 

nonutility margin decreased 17 million in 2020 and increased 15 million in 2019 the change in both periods was primarily due to timing from the unrealized and realized margins presented in the following tables 



 

a natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future andor natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related nonderivative pipeline transportation contract these gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are markedtomarket without revaluing the related nonderivative contracts 

b amount includes 15 million of timing related losses related to gas strategies which will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle 

c amount includes 10 million of timing related gains related to gas strategies recognized in previous periods that reversed as the underlying contracts settled

c amount includes 61 million of timing related gains related to gas strategies recognized in previous periods that reversed as the underlying contracts settled 

outlook — in the nearterm energy trading expects market conditions to remain challenging the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of rtos significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments physical power and natural gas contracts and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas and environmental inventory contracts for pipeline transportation storage assets and some environmental contracts are not derivatives as a result energy trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets energy tradings strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

see also the fair value section herein and notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report fair value and financial and other derivative instruments respectively 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and holds certain investments including funds supporting regional development and economic growth the 2020 net loss of 80 million represents a decrease of 36 million from the 2019 net loss of 116 million this decrease was primarily due a tax adjustment recorded in 2020 pursuant to the cares act which allowed the carryback of net operating losses five years for tax years 2018 through 2020 this enabled dte energy to carryback 2018 net operating losses to 2013 and resulted in a 34 million reduction to income tax expense refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report income taxes for additional information regarding the cares act and related impacts 

the 2019 net loss of 116 million represents a decrease of 13 million from the 2018 net loss of 129 million this decrease was primarily due to lower state income taxes and decreased contributions to notforprofit organizations partially offset by higher interest expense and impairment of an equity method investment 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

dte energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities to grow the nonutility businesses to retire and pay interest on longterm debt and to pay dividends dte energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements dte energy expects that cash from operations in 2021 will be approximately 30 billion dte energy anticipates base level utility capital investments including environmental renewable and energy waste reduction expenditures expenditures for nonutility businesses and contributions to equity method investees in 2021 of approximately 42 billion dte energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

refer to the capital investments section above for additional information on dte energys capital strategy and estimated spend over the next five years any capital commitments are also included in the disclosure of purchase commitments within note 19 to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of dte energys operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric retail access regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

net cash from operations increased 10 billion in 2020 the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income depreciation and amortization and cash from tax refunds and working capital items 

net cash from operations decreased 31 million in 2019 the reduction was primarily due to a decrease in cash from working capital items partially offset by an increase in noncash items primarily deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 

the change in working capital items in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in cash related to accounts receivable net accounts payable and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by a decrease in cash related to prepaid postretirement benefit costs and regulatory assets and liabilities the change in working capital items in 2019 was primarily related to an increase in cash used for accounts payable and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in cash related to accounts receivable net accrued pension and postretirement costs and regulatory assets and liabilities 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions in any given year dte energy looks to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within the nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth dte energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis dte energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria for new business lines dte energy initially invests based on research and analysis dte energy starts with a limited investment evaluates the results and either expands or exits the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of dte energy with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings 

net cash used for investing activities decreased 17 billion in 2020 due primarily to a decrease in acquisitions related to business combinations net of cash acquired primarily driven by dte energys acquisition of blue union and leap in 2019 for net cash of 23 billion the decrease was also due to lower contributions to equity method investees partially offset by an increase in plant and equipment expenditures 

net cash used for investing activities increased 24 billion in 2019 due primarily to the acquisition of blue union and leap and higher plant and equipment expenditures partially offset by lower contributions to equity method investees 

cash from financing activities 

dte energy relies on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations 

dte energys strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity dte energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from financing activities decreased 23 billion in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to the issuance of equity units and common stock associated with the acquisition of blue union and leap in 2019 as well as an increase in cash used for shortterm borrowings net and the acquisition related deferred payment in 2020 these decreases were partially offset by higher cash from issuances of longterm debt net of issuance costs and lower purchases of noncontrolling interest principally sgg 

net cash from financing activities increased 24 billion in 2019 the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash from issuances of longterm debt equity units common stock and shortterm borrowings partially offset by an increase in cash used for redemptions of longterm debt and purchases of noncontrolling interests principally sgg the increased issuances in 2019 were primarily related to the acquisition of blue union and leap for further details refer to the acquisition financing section of note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report longterm debt 

outlook 

dte energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from the utility and nonutility businesses growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments power and industrial projects cash flows are expected to temporarily decrease beginning in 2022 as ref facilities will have ceased operations growth from new industrial energy services projects and renewable energy investments are expected to offset these decreases over the longterm 

dte energys intention to spinoff the dte midstream business could also reduce cash flows if the separation transaction is completed however dte energy would still expect higher cash flows from operations over the longterm due to the growth of its utilities and other nonutility operations dte energy will continue to assess the impact of the potential spinoff transaction on its cash flows including any financing activity related to the separation of dte midstream 

dte energy may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future dte energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of longterm capital projects 

dte energy has 469 million in longterm debt including finance leases maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the debt is expected to be made through internally generated funds or the issuance of new longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 31 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2020 consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

at the discretion of management and depending upon economic and financial market conditions dte energy expects to issue equity up to 200 million in 2021 if issued dte energy anticipates up to 100 million of these equity issuances will be made through contributions to the qualified pension plans at dte electric dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2021 any additional equity issuances are expected to be made through the dividend reinvestment plan and other employee benefit plans 

to finance the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in december 2019 dte energy issued equity units that will result in the issuance of common stock in november 2022 this transaction is not expected to impact dte energys cash flows future cash flow impacts will relate primarily to the payment of dte energys remaining stock purchase liability associated with the equity units refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements longterm debt for additional information over the longterm dte energy does not have any other equity commitments and will continue to evaluate equity needs on an annual basis in consideration of economic and financial market conditions 

dte energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for more than 100 consecutive years and expects to continue paying regular cash dividends in the future including approximately 08 billion in 2021 any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by the board of directors and may depend on dte energys future earnings capital requirements and financial condition over the longterm dte energy expects continued dividend growth and is targeting a payout ratio consistent with pureplay utility companies 

various subsidiaries and equity investees of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as hard triggers state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as soft triggers are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power environmental and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2020 dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was 428 million 

dte energy is actively monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic on capital markets and any related effects to our cost of capital during 2020 concerns over the pandemic led to an impact in liquidity in the commercial paper market and increases to related borrowing costs despite these impacts the registrants have maintained adequate liquidity due to the availability of committed credit facilities and by raising additional liquidity through term loans and the public issuance of debt while paying off maturing commercial paper 

dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all dte energys businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows 

see notes 10 11 15 17 19 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report regulatory matters income taxes longterm debt shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings commitments and contingencies and retirement benefits and trusteed assets respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table details dte energys including dte electrics contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2020 



 

a excludes 25 million of unamortized debt discount and 104 million of unamortized debt issuance costs 

b excludes 35 million of unamortized debt issuance costs 

c includes 3 million of interest 

d excludes amounts associated with full requirements contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required and 58 million of obligations between dte electric and affiliates of dte energy 

e the agreements represent the minimum obligations with suppliers for renewable energy and renewable energy credits under existing contract terms which expire from 2030 through 2035 dte electrics share of plant output ranges from 28 to 100 

f excludes 51 million of power purchase agreements between dte electric and nonutility affiliates of dte energy 

g excludes 316 million of other longterm liabilities that do not reflect contractual obligations or for which the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated including 10 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

h at december 31 2020 dte energy met the minimum pension funding levels required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the pension protection act of 2006 for the defined benefit pension plans dte energy may contribute more than the minimum funding requirements for the pension plans and may also make contributions to other postretirement benefit plans however these amounts are not included in the table above as such amounts are discretionary planned funding levels are disclosed in the capital resources and liquidity and critical accounting estimates sections herein and in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report retirement benefits and trusteed assets 

credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

in april 2020 fitch ratings downgraded dte energys unsecured debt rating from bbb to bbb the downgrade primarily reflects increased leverage and business risk associated with dte energys acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in december 2019 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements acquisitions and dispositions for additional information the downgrade has not negatively impacted dte energys liquidity or access to the capital markets 

in october 2020 dte energy announced its intent to spinoff its midstream business we do not expect the separation transaction to negatively impact dte energys credit ratings liquidity or access to the capital markets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the registrants consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements the registrants management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of the registrants businesses are subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses the registrants management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report regulatory matters 

derivatives 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2020 and 2019 the registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values the registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the registrants estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices the registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts see the sensitivity analysis in item 7a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report fair value and financial and other derivative instruments respectively 

goodwill 

certain of dte energys reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations dte energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in performing the impairment test dte energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit an impairment loss would be recognized a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

dte energy estimates the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit for certain reporting units the fair values were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows and the market approach which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries the income approach includes a terminal value that utilizes an assumed longterm growth rate approach which incorporates managements assumptions regarding sustainable longterm growth of the reporting units the income approach cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance 

one of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies management selects comparable peers based on each peer’s primary business mix operations and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of the test date 

dte energy performs an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests dte energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while dte energy believes the assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact dte energys earnings 

dte energy performed its annual impairment test as of october 1 2020 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed 

the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the october 1 2020 valuation date 



 

a percentage by which the fair value of equity of the reporting unit would need to decline to equal its carrying value including goodwill 

b discounted cash flows dcf incorporated 20212025 projected cash flows plus a calculated terminal value for each of the reporting units dte energy capitalized the terminal year cash flows at the weighted average costs of capital wacc less an assumed longterm growth rate of 20 management applied equal weighting to the dcf and market multiples analysis where applicable to determine the fair value of the respective reporting units 

c due to lack of market comparable information for the power  industrial and energy trading reporting units dte energy did not perform a market multiples analysis 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined based on significant estimates and assumptions including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future market prices in some cases dte energy engages independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements acquisitions and dispositions 

longlived assets 

the registrants evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require the registrants to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact their earnings 

pension and other postretirement costs 

dte energy sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the registrants the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required dte energy considers historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

dte energy had pension costs of 148 million in 2020 112 million in 2019 and 148 million in 2018 other postretirement benefit credits were 49 million in 2020 1 million in 2019 and 36 million in 2018 pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for 2020 were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 710 for the pension plans and 720 for the other postretirement benefit plans in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumptions dte energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets dte energys 2021 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 37 in equity markets 38 in fixed income markets including long duration bonds and 25 invested in other assets dte energys 2021 expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 23 in equity markets 52 in fixed income markets and 25 invested in other assets because of market volatility dte energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate dte energy is lowering its longterm rate of return assumption for the pension plans to 700 and lowering the other postretirement plans to 670 for 2021 dte energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rates of return on the plans assets for 2021 given their respective asset allocations and dtes capital market expectations dte energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions including its expected rate of return at least annually 

dte energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for the pension plans dte energy uses a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized favorable asset performance in 2020 resulted in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2020 dte energy had 507 million of cumulative gains related to investment performance in prior years that were not yet recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for other postretirement benefit plans dte energy uses fair value when determining the mrv of plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that dte energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans the discount rate determined on this basis was 257 for the pension and 258 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2020 compared to 328 and 329 respectively for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2019 

dte energy changed the mortality assumptions as of december 31 2020 to reflect recent plan experience and the updated base tables and projection scales published by the society of actuaries the mortality assumptions used at december 31 2020 are the pri2012 mortality table projected to 2018 using scale mp2019 and projected forward from 2018 using scale mp2020 with generational projection the base mortality tables vary by type of plan employees union status and employment status with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population 

dte energy estimates that total pension costs will be approximately 136 million in 2021 compared to 148 million in 2020 the 2020 total pension costs included 25 million of onetime settlement charges excluding these charges total pension costs are expected to increase from 2020 to 2021 which is primarily due to a lower discount rate and expected rate of return the 2021 other postretirement benefit credit is estimated at approximately 39 million compared to 49 million in 2020 the expected decrease in the credit is primarily due to a lower discount rate and expected rate of return 

the health care trend rates for dte energy assume 675 for pre65 participants and 725 for post65 participants for 2021 trending down to 450 for both pre65 and post65 participants in 2033 

future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2020 pension costs by approximately 47 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2020 pension costs by approximately 23 million lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2020 other postretirement credit by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased the 2020 other postretirement credit by approximately 18 million 

the value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 75 billion at december 31 2020 and 68 billion at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 dte energys qualified pension plans were underfunded by 653 million and its other postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by 153 million in 2020 the funded status of the pension plans improved as plan sponsor contributions and favorable asset returns were partially offset by a decrease in discount rates the funded status of the other postretirement benefit plans improved as favorable asset returns and a favorable change in healthcare cost assumptions were partially offset by a decrease in discount rates 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets dte energy made contributions to its qualified pension plans of 92 million in 2020 and 150 million in 2019 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to 107 million in 2021 and up to 128 million over the next five years dte energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2020 or 2019 dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement plans in 2021 or over the next five years the planned pension contributions will be made in cash andor dte energy common stock

legal reserves 

the registrants are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon the registrants management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the registrants 

accounting for tax obligations 

the registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold the registrants also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the consolidated financial statements the registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2020 and 2019 are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the registrants consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts dte energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power natural gas some environmental contracts and certain forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items dte energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory pipeline transportation contracts storage assets and some environmental contracts see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report fair value and financial and other derivative instruments respectively 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and some environmental contracts which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in the registrants reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the registrants manage their mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

the electric and gas businesses have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of coal natural gas uranium and electricity however the registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales and transportation services revenue at the gas segment the gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the registrants are exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

dte energys gas storage and pipelines segment is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves in its areas of operation low prices for natural gas including those resulting from regional basis differentials could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that is accessible to our pipeline and storage 

assets dte energy manages its exposure through the use of short medium and longterm storage gathering and transportation contracts 

dte energys power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity natural gas and coal product price risk dte energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of longterm contracts 

dte energys energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas environmental crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

dte energys power and industrial projects segment holds ownership interests in and operates five generating plants that sell electric output from renewable sources under longterm power purchase agreements with pge pge filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on january 29 2019 pge emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy effective july 1 2020 dtes renewable power purchase agreements were assumed under pges reorganization plan and payment has been received for all past due receivables related to these agreements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the registrants regularly review contingent matters existing and future economic conditions customer trends and other factors relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts the registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss 

trading activities 

dte energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations dte energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties 

the following table displays the credit quality of dte energys trading counterparties as of december 31 2020 



 

a this category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of baa3 assigned by moody’s investors service moody’s or bbb assigned by standard  poor’s rating group a division of mcgrawhill companies inc standard  poor’s the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented 13 of the total gross credit exposure 

b this category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented 1 of the total gross credit exposure 

c this category includes counterparties that have not been rated by moody’s or standard  poor’s but are considered investment grade based on dte energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented 14 of the total gross credit exposure 

d this category includes counterparties that have not been rated by moody’s or standard  poor’s and are considered noninvestment grade based on dte energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness the five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented 4 of the total gross credit exposure 

other 

the registrants engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade the registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt in order to manage interest costs dte energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements dte energys exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and libor as of december 31 2020 dte energy had floating rate debt of 38 million and a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of 02 

foreign currency exchange risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit dte energys exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations dte energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through june 2030 

summary of sensitivity analyses 

sensitivity analyses were performed on the fair values of commodity contracts for dte energy and longterm debt obligations for the registrants the commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at december 31 2020 and 2019 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values the hypothetical losses related to longterm debt would be realized only if dte energy transferred all of its fixedrate longterm debt to other creditors

electric 

description 

dte energys electric segment consists principally of dte electric an electric utility engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 22 million customers in southeastern michigan dte electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and egle electricity is generated from fossilfuel plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant a nuclear plant wind and other renewable assets and is supplemented with purchased power the electricity is sold or distributed through the retail access program to three major classes of customers residential commercial and industrial throughout southeastern michigan 

weather economic factors competition energy waste reduction initiatives and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers dte electrics peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands dte electrics operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte electric 

the electric segment also consists of nonutility operations relating to renewable energy projects at dte sustainable generation these projects have been acquired in support of dte energys renewable energy goals 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report  revenue  

fuel supply and purchased power 

dte electrics power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power dte electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers dte electrics generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms dte electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases dte electric has longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 22 million tons of lowsulfur western coal and approximately 2 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2020 to 2021  all of these contracts have pricing schedules dte electric has approximately 99 of the expected coal requirements for 2020 under contract given the geographic diversity of supply dte electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements dte electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western and eastern coal rail requirements under multiyear contracts the company expects to cover all of its vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities through new agreements 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso dte electric offers its generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load dte electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages 

properties 

dte electric owns generating facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of dte electrics property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating facilities owned and in service as of december 31 2019 for the electric segment are shown in the following table 



 

 see capital investments in managements discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report for information regarding plant retirements and future capital expenditures 

dte electric owns and operates 700 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 37025000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 445200 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 32392000 kva 

circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2019 are shown in the following table 



there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between dte electric and electricity providers external to the dte electric service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission an unrelated company and connect to neighboring energy companies 

regulation 

dte electric is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte electrics mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on investments the ferc regulates dte electric with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of dte electrics nuclear plant operations dte electric is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 9 10 13 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  asset retirement obligations   regulatory matters   fair value  and  commitments and contingencies  

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance that qualifying customers receive dte electric works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte electric also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to customers 

strategy and competition 

dte electrics electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner with potential capacity constraints in the miso region there will be increased dependency on dte electrics generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers this generation will require continuing investments in dte electrics primary coal generating units nuclear generating plant a natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility and renewables 

dte electrics distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to customers dte electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

the electric retail access program in michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2019  2018  and 2017 and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total retail access related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on dte electrics financial performance and full service customer rates energy legislation passed in 2016 retained the 10 retail access cap with some revisions dte electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales in 2020  

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers dte electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

gas 

description 

dte energys gas segment consists principally of dte gas a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity 

dte gas natural gas sales enduser transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of the business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and dte gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in annual average customer usage are minimized by the rdm 

dte gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte gas 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report  revenue  

natural gas supply 

dte gas gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 25 bcf with approximately 68 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2019  peakuse requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity dte gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements dte gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

dte gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify dte gas natural gas supply base natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas appalachian gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpscapproved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2022  

dte gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the appalachian gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions the primary longterm transportation supply contracts at december 31 2019 are listed below

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte gas ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte gas uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive dte gas works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte gas also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to dte gas customers 

strategy and competition 

dte gas strategy is to ensure the safe reliable and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in michigan in addition dte gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to underserved markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces water heaters and appliances within its current customer base dte gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy waste reduction products and services to its customers making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for enduser transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for dte gas enduser transportation service dte gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by its storage capacity 

having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of dte gas storage and transportation services to gas producers marketers distribution companies enduser customers and other pipeline companies the business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

 energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power natural gas and environmental marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power environmental and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers energy tradings customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

energy trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the mtm method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives energy trading utilizes forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments physical power and natural gas contracts and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas and environmental inventory contracts for pipeline transportation storage assets and some environmental contracts are not derivatives as a result this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the business’ strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the cftc us department of homeland security and doe in addition energy trading is subject to applicable laws rules and regulations in canada

corporate and other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and holds energyrelated investments 

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers the following table summarizes dte energys including dte electrics estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations pending or future reconsiderations of current regulations may impact the estimated expenditures summarized in the table below actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



water — the epa finalized regulations on cooling water intake in august 2014 dte electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes 

contaminated and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites dte gas owns or previously owned 14 such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites dte energy anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the subsequent year the mgp costs were incurred will prevent the associated investigation and remediation costs from having a material adverse effect on dte energys operations dte electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site 

the registrants are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electric distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the registrants financial position and cash flows and the rates charged to their customers 

coal combustion residuals and effluent limitations guidelines — a final epa rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals commonly known as coal ash became effective in october 2015 and was revised in october 2016 and july 2018 the rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a nonhazardous waste and relies on various selfimplementation design and performance standards dte electric owns and operates three permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coalfired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants subject to certain provisions in the ccr rule at certain facilities the rule currently requires the installation of monitoring wells compliance with groundwater standards and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant at other facilities the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks dte electric has estimated the impact of the current rule to be 608 million  

on december 2 2019 a proposed revision to the ccr rule was published in the federal register to address the dc circuit’s 2018 decision regarding ccr impoundments that are not lined with an engineered liner system the rule proposes that all ccr impoundments that do not meet the engineered liner requirements must close by specific dates and it further confirms that all clay lined impoundments are viewed as unlined the epa is also preparing a rule making that is expected to be proposed early in 2020 that will provide mechanisms to determine if certain alternative liner systems may be as protective as the current liners specified in the ccr rule dte electric is currently evaluating options based on the range of outcomes of the current proposed rule and the anticipated proposed rule to determine any changes to dte electrics plans in the operation and closure of coal ash impoundments 

in november 2015 the epa finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which requires additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023 the initial costs to comply with this rule are under development and estimates are included in the coal combustion residual and effluent limitations guidelines amount in the above table 

on april 12 2017 the epa granted a petition for reconsideration of the elg rule the epa also signed an administrative stay of the elg rule’s compliance deadlines for fly ash transport water bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization fgd wastewater among others on june 6 2017 the epa published in the federal register a proposed rule to postpone certain applicable deadlines within the elg rule the final rule was published on september 18 2017 the final rule nullified the administrative stay but also extended the earliest compliance deadlines for the fgd wastewater and bottom ash transport water until november 1 2020 in order for the epa to propose and finalize a new ruling on november 22 2019 the epa issued a proposed rule to revise the technologybased effluent limitations guidelines and standards applicable to flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water the elg compliance requirements and final deadlines for bottom ash transport water and fgd wastewater and total elg related compliance costs will not be known until the epa completes its reconsideration of the elg rule 

air — dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of so 2 and no x  the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce so 2  no x  mercury and other emissions these rulemakings could require additional controls for so 2  no x  and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures will be necessary to comply with air pollution requirements through 2026  subject to the results of future rulemakings 

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing fossilfuel egus in 2019 the performance standards for existing egus also known as the clean power plan were officially repealed and replaced by the ace rule the ace rule requires the state of michigan to submit a plan in 2022 that includes ghg standards for existing coalfired power plant units in michigan these final rules do not impact dte energys revised commitment to reduce carbon emissions 32 by the early 2020s 50 by 2030 and 80 by 2040 or its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 for dte electric from the 2005 carbon emissions levels 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc

employees 

dte energy and its subsidiaries had approximately 10700 employees as of december 31 2019  of which approximately 5300 were represented by unions dte electric had approximately 4900 employees as of december 31 2019  of which approximately 2800 were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for dte energy subsidiaries represented employees the majority of represented employees for both dte energy and dte electric are under contracts that expire in 2021 and 2022  




 item 1a risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of the registrants utility businesses and dte energys nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the registrants below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses although the registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect performance 

the registrants are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization the registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies the registrants ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations regulators may also disagree with the registrants rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business if the registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact the registrants ability to recover certain costs through customer rates regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for the registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers the registrants cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how the business operates impact the registrants ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery or require the registrants to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric retail access program could negatively impact the registrants financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for dte electric customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes the registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity 

the registrants electric distribution system and dte energys gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation which could reduce revenues increase expenses and have a material adverse effect on their business financial position and results of operations the registrants electric distribution and dte energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks these operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years equipment even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices is subject to operational failure including events that are beyond the registrants control and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently because the registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of the registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties 

dte energys nonutility businesses may not perform to its expectations dte energy relies on nonutility operations for an increasing portion of earnings if dte energys current and contemplated nonutility investments including the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in december 2019 do not perform at expected levels dte energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value 

dte energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from the utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

the registrants businesses have safety risks the registrants electric distribution system power plants renewable energy equipment and other facilities and dte energys gas distribution system gas infrastructure and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury death or property loss to employees customers third parties or the public although the registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident they could experience financial loss damage to their reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

environmental laws and liability may be costly the registrants are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in the registrants generation fleet and for dte energys gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require the registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals the registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally the registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body the registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

the registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulations of ghg emissions are implemented the operations of dte electrics fossilfueled generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process the registrants financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

for dte energy future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of dte energys gas transportation businesses 

threats of cyber incidents physical security and terrorism could affect the registrants business issues may threaten the registrants such as cyber incidents physical security or terrorism that may disrupt the registrants operations and could harm the registrants operating results 

information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches the registrants industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents physical security threats acts of war or terrorism and other causes as well as loss of operational control of the registrants electric generation and distribution assets and dte energys gas distribution assets if the registrants information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way the registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business operating results and financial condition 

suppliers vendors contractors and information technology providers have access to systems that support the registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data a breach of these thirdparty systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system also  because the registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility electric generator system operator or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the registrants’ businesses operating results and financial condition 

in addition the registrants generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and dte energys gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products the registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the registrants cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the registrants in connection with the registrants businesses they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers shareholders and employees customers shareholders and employees expect that the registrants will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the registrants reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

construction and capital improvements to the registrants power facilities dte energys distribution systems and its gas storage and pipelines business subject them to risk the registrants are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at the registrants multiple power generation and distribution facilities at dte energys gas distribution system and at dte energys gas storage and pipelines business many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the registrants control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals including required certificates from regulatory agencies construction disputes impediments to acquiring rightsofway or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms cost overruns and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the registrants financial performance operations or expected investment returns at the affected facilities businesses and development projects 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects the registrants to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the registrants to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options a specific example of increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements is dte electric having an open confirmatory action letter with the nrc to complete specific mitigation actions during the next periodic outage in 2020 and that dte electric will not bring the plant back on line until it is completed insurance maintained by the registrants for various nuclearrelated risks may not be sufficient to cover the registrants costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant which may affect the registrants financial performance in addition the registrants nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning a decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the registrants’ liquidity financial position or results of operations 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact the registrants financial results the registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations dte energys access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers dte energys nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts dte electric charges utility customers for electricity and dte gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of dte energys nonutility businesses the registrants hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for dte energys nonutility businesses particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers as well as midstream services that depend on the demand for natural gas 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact the registrants financial results  the registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of their facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the registrants utility products and for dte energy on the profitability of the nonutility businesses 

emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the registrants  advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include costeffective renewable energy technologies distributed generation energy waste reduction technologies and energy storage devices such developments may impact the price of energy may affect energy deliveries as customerowned generation becomes more costeffective may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply andor distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy each of these factors could materially affect the registrants’ results of operations cash flows or financial position 

adverse changes in the registrants credit ratings may negatively affect them regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in the registrants economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in the registrants credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in the registrants credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact their liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the registrants liquidity and results of operations the registrants costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and the registrants required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the registrants plans the registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below the registrants projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the registrants utility customers the results of operations and financial position of the registrants could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets the registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the registrants cash flows financial position or results of operations 

the registrants ability to access capital markets is important the registrants ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain the registrants ability as well as the ability of their subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the registrants access to capital markets the registrants longterm revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2024  but the registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the registrants utilities and dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

dte energys participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations dte energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed dte energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose dte energy to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks dte energys trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines dte energy sets resulting from the management of dte energys business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish dte energys financial results and financial position dte energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

weather significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the registrants earnings and cash flows mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the registrants assets lowering income and cash flows at dte electric ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance the registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation the registrants financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs 

regional national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the registrants the registrants utility and dte energys nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with should the financial conditions of some of dte energys significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional national or international economic conditions reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services dte energy supplies collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows 

renewable portfolio standards and energy waste reduction may affect the registrants business and federal and state fuel standards may affect dte energys nonutility investments the registrants are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy the registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future in addition the registrants expect to comply with new michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

in addition the registrants are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the registrants revenues as customers decrease their energy usage the registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results 

dte energys nonutility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal renewable fuel standard and californias low carbon fuel standard changes to these standards may affect dte energys business and result in lower earnings 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the registrants ’ operations the registrants businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the registrants business and future operating results in addition the registrants have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations 

a work interruption may adversely affect the registrants there are several bargaining units for dte energys approximately 5300 and dte electrics approximately 2800 represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2021 and 2022  a union choosing to strike would have an impact on the registrants businesses the registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance 

dte energys ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources the registrants generated production tax credits from renewable energy generation and dte energy generated production tax credits from renewable gas recovery reduced emission fuel and gas production operations if the registrants production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit or changes in tax law there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the registrants earnings and cash flows 

if dte energys goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it may be required to record a charge to earnings dte energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment goodwill and other intangible assets are also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization slower industry growth rates or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows dte energy cannot predict the timing strength or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery if the carrying value of any goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be not recoverable dte energy may take a noncash impairment charge which could materially impact dte energys results of operations and financial position 

the registrants may not be fully covered by insurance the registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters war terrorism cyber incidents or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the registrants operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or the registrants insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following combined discussion is separately filed by dte energy and dte electric however dte electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to dte energy or the subsidiaries of dte energy other than itself 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2019 operating revenues of approximately 127 billion and total assets of approximately 419 billion  dte energy is the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan dte energy operates three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes dte energys financial results 



the increase in 2019 net income attributable to dte energy company was primarily due to higher earnings in the electric and gas segments partially offset by lower earnings in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments the decrease in 2018 net income attributable to dte energy company was primarily due to lower earnings in the gas storage and pipelines energy trading and corporate and other segments partially offset by higher earnings in the electric gas and power and industrial projects segments the 2018 decrease was primarily due to higher income tax expense as 2017 included a onetime net income tax benefit of 105 million related to the enactment of the tcja 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

dte energys utilities are investing capital to improve customer reliability through investments in base infrastructure and new generation and to comply with environmental requirements dte energy expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte energy is focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability dte energy operates in a constructive regulatory environment and has solid relationships with its regulators 

in march 2019 dte energy announced updated plans for accelerating its reduction of carbon emissions to 32 by the early 2020s 50 by 2030 and 80 by 2040 from the 2005 carbon emissions levels in september 2019 dte energy expanded on its commitment by announcing a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for dte electric to achieve the reduction goals in the near term dte energy will transition away from coalpowered sources and incorporate more renewable energy energy waste reduction projects demand response and natural gas fueled generation dte energy has already begun the transition in the way it produces power through the continued retirement of its aging coalfired plants refer to the capital investments section below for further discussion 

dte energy has significant investments in nonutility businesses dte energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets skills and expertise and provides diversity in earnings and geography specifically dte energy invests in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile dte energy expects growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity dte energy has an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

dte energys utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

dte electrics capital investments over the 20202024 period are estimated at 120 billion comprised of 40 billion for capital replacements and other projects 50 billion for distribution infrastructure and 30 billion for new generation dte electric has retired five coalfired generation units at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities and has announced plans to retire its remaining twelve coalfired generating units six of these coalfired generating units will be retired through 2022 at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities the remaining coalfired generating units at the belle river and monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040 the retired facilities will be replaced with renewables energy waste reduction demand response and natural gas fueled generation 

dte gas capital investments over the 20202024 period are estimated at 30 billion comprised of 14 billion for base infrastructure and 16 billion for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs 

dte electric and dte gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment 

dte energys nonutility businesses capital investments are primarily for expansion growth and ongoing maintenance gas storage and pipelines capital investments over the 20202024 period are estimated at 22 billion to 27 billion for gathering and pipeline investments and expansions power and industrial projects capital investments over the 20202024 period are estimated at 10 billion to 14 billion for industrial energy services and rng projects 

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially the registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers as authorized by the mpsc 

air — dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of so 2 and no x  the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce so 2  no x  mercury and other emissions additional rulemakings may occur over the next few years which could require additional controls for so 2  no x  and other hazardous air pollutants to comply with existing requirements dte electric spent approximately 24 billion through 2019  dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures through 2026  pending the results of future rulemakings 

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions in 2015 the epa finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing fossilfuel egus in 2019 the performance standards for existing egus also known as the clean power plan were officially repealed and replaced by the ace rule the ace rule requires the state of michigan to submit a plan in 2022 that includes ghg standards for existing coalfired power plant units in michigan it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the epas ace rule on existing sources at this time 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

increased costs for energy produced from traditional coalbased sources due to recent pending and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable natural gas fueled generation andor nuclear sources energy waste reduction initiatives and the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon instruments which could provide new business opportunities for dte energys utility and nonutility segments at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on the registrants or their customers 

see items 1 and 2 business and properties and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  commitments and contingencies  for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry dte energys strong utility base combined with its integrated nonutility operations position it well for longterm growth 

looking forward dte energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance 

 dte energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as the nongaap financial measures utility margin and nonutility margin discussed below which dte energy uses as measures of its operational performance generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

dte energy uses utility margin and nonutility margin nongaap financial measures to assess its performance by reportable segment 

utility margin includes electric utility and gas utility operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses the utilities’ fuel purchased power and natural gas supply are passed through to customers and therefore result in changes to the utilities’ revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses as such dte energy believes utility margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the utilities’ operations across periods as it excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses for the electric segment nonutility operating revenues are reported separately so that utility margin can be used to assess utility performance 

the nonutility margin relates to the power and industrial projects and energy trading segments for the power and industrial projects segment nonutility margin primarily includes operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses operating revenues include sales of refined coal to third parties and the affiliated electric utility metallurgical coke and related byproducts petroleum coke renewable natural gas and electricity as well as rental income and revenues from utilitytype consulting management and operational services for the energy trading segment nonutility margin includes revenue and realized and unrealized gains and losses from physical and financial power and gas marketing optimization and trading activities net of purchased power and gas related to these activities dte energy evaluates its operating performance of these nonutility businesses using the measure of operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses 

utility margin and nonutility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap utility margin and nonutility margin do not intend to represent operating income the most comparable gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of dte energys segments segment information described below includes intercompany revenues and expenses and other income and deductions that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 



electric 

the results of operations discussion for dte electric is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with general instruction i 2 a of form 10k for whollyowned subsidiaries 

the electric segment consists principally of dte electric electric results are discussed below 



see dte electrics consolidated statements of operations in item 8 of this report for a complete view of its results differences between the electric segment and dte electrics consolidated statements of operations are primarily due to the classification of certain benefit costs refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements  retirement benefits and trusteed assets  for additional information 

utility margin increased 91 million in 2019 and 98 million in 2018  revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the registrants consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





 

 dte electric changes in sales for residential commercial and industrial are primarily due to less favorable weather in 2019 compared to 2018 

operating revenues — nonutility operations increased 5 million in 2019 due to renewable energy projects acquired by dte sustainable generation in september 2019 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 3 million in 2019 and increased 55 million in 2018  the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to decreased uncollectible expense of 19 million and decreased generation expense of 3 million partially offset by higher tree trim expense of 20 million tree trim expenses increased by 63 million but were offset by amounts deferred to a regulatory asset of 43 million the increase in 2018 was primarily due to increased uncollectible expense of 34 million due to customer billing initiatives following implementation of the new billing system increased power plant generation expense of 24 million an increase in energy waste reduction expense of 10 million to meet higher energy savings targets partially offset by decreased distribution operations expense of 13 million 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 113 million in 2019 and 83 million in 2018  in 2019  the increase was primarily due to a 124 million increase resulting from a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective may 2019 a 6 million increase associated with the rps and a 4 million increase resulting from new nonutility assets at dte sustainable generation partially offset by a decrease of 17 million associated with the trm in 2018  the increase was primarily due to an increase to depreciable base of 46 million and an increase of 42 million associated with the trm partially offset by a decrease in regulatory asset amortization of 5 million 

asset gains losses and impairments net increased 14 million in 2019 and decreased 1 million in 2018  in 2019  the increase was primarily due to previously recorded capital expenditures of 13 million that were disallowed in the may 2 2019 rate order 

other income and deductions decreased 26 million in 2019 and increased 26 million in 2018  the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to a change in investment earnings gain of 37 million in 2019 compared to a loss of 11 million in 2018 and lower nonoperating retirement benefits expense of 12 million partially offset by higher interest expense of 32 million the increase in 2018 was primarily due to higher interest expense of 9 million and change in investment earnings loss of 11 million in 2018 compared to a gain of 26 million in 2017 partially offset by decreased nonoperating retirement benefits expense of 13 million and a contribution to the dte energy foundation of 7 million in 2017 

income tax expense decreased 56 million in 2019 and 128 million in 2018  the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to tcja regulatory liability amortization of 35 million and higher production tax credits in 2019 the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to the reduction in the federal tax rate in the tcja that was enacted in december 2017 

outlook — dte electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while keeping customer rate increases affordable looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and effects of energy waste reduction programs 

dte electric filed a rate case with the mpsc on july 8 2019 requesting an increase in base rates of 351 million based on a projected twelvemonth period ending april 30 2021 the requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure and generation investments the rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 100 to 105 and includes projected changes in sales and operating and maintenance expenses a final mpsc order in this case is expected by may 2020 refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  for additional information 

gas 

the gas segment consists principally of dte gas gas results are discussed below 



utility margin increased 65 million in 2019 and 45 million in 2018  revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in dte energys consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





operation and maintenance expense increased 13 million in 2019 and 53 million in 2018  the increase in 2019 was primarily due to higher gas operations expenses of 22 million  which included higher pipeline integrity and other operating costs and higher customer service costs of 4 million  partially offset by decreased uncollectible expense of 14 million  the increase in 2018 was primarily due to increased uncollectible expense of 28 million due to customer billing initiatives following implementation of a new customer billing system and higher gas operations expenses of 22 million  which included increased investment spending and higher pipeline integrity expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 11 million in 2019 and 10 million in 2018  the increase in both periods was primarily due to increases in depreciable base 

other income and deductions increased 4 million in 2019 and decreased 19 million in 2018  the increase in 2019 was primarily due to higher interest expense of 8 million partially offset by lower contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations of 6 million the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to lower contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations of 27 million partially offset by higher interest expense of 6 million 

income tax expense decreased 5 million in 2019 and 11 million in 2018  the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the absence of a 10 million tcja expense recorded in 2018 partially offset by increased tax expense on higher earnings in 2019 the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to the reduction in the federal tax rate in the tcja that was enacted in december 2017 partially offset by a 10 million tcja expense and the absence of the 7 million favorable depreciation tax benefit that ended in 2017 

outlook — dte gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs dte gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

dte gas filed a rate case with the mpsc on november 25 2019 requesting an increase in base rates of 204 million based on a projected twelvemonth period ending september 30 2021 the requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments and operating and maintenance expenses the rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 100 to 105 and includes projected changes in sales and working capital a final mpsc order in this case is expected by september 2020 

gas storage and pipelines 

the gas storage and pipelines segment consists of the nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations increased 16 million in 2019 and 32 million in 2018  the increase in both periods was primarily due to higher pipeline and gathering revenues partially offset by lower physical sales of gas from ags customers and lower storage revenues the 2019 increase includes the acquisition of blue union in december 2019 and the first full year of birdsboro pipeline operations 

cost of gas — nonutility decreased 4 million in 2019 and 8 million in 2018  the decrease in both periods was driven primarily by lower physical purchases of gas from ags customers 

operation and maintenance expense increased 17 million in 2019 and 20 million in 2018  the 2019 increase was primarily due to transaction costs associated with the blue union and leap acquisition and higher labor related expenses the 2018 increase was primarily due to higher labor related expenses and additional compression activity on the bluestone pipeline and susquehanna gathering systems 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 12 million in 2019 and 6 million in 2018  the 2019 increase was primarily due to additional pipeline and gathering assets placed into service during the year 

other income and deductions decreased 27 million in 2019 and increased 43 million in 2018  the 2019 decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from pipeline investments and higher interest expense the 2018 increase was primarily due to higher earnings from pipeline investments and a 16 million net loss on extinguishment of debt within the storage business in 2017 partially offset by higher interest expense 

income tax expense benefit increased 6 million in 2019 and 98 million in 2018  the 2018 increase was primarily driven by the 115 million remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 12 million in 2019 and increased 1 million in 2018  the 2019 decrease was primarily due to the may 2019 purchase of an additional 30 ownership interest in sgg 

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report acquisitions for discussion of the acquisition of blue union and leap in december 2019 

outlook — significant expansion activities are underway to increase capacity of the blue union and leap assets which provide natural gas gathering and other midstream services to producers located primarily in louisiana 

dte energy believes its longterm agreements with producers and the quality of the natural gas reserves in the marcellusutica and haynesville shale regions soundly position the business for future growth gas storage and pipelines will continue to execute quality investments with a focus on continued organic growth from wellpositioned existing assets 

power and industrial projects 

the power and industrial projects segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity and pipelinequality gas from renewable energy projects power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations decreased 644 million in 2019 and increased 115 million in 2018  the changes are due to the following 



nonutility margin increased 24 million in 2019 and 40 million in 2018  the changes are due to the following 



operation and maintenance expense decreased 35 million in 2019 and increased 21 million in 2018  the 2019 decrease was primarily due to 33 million associated with the sale of membership interests in the ref business and 9 million lower spend in the renewables business primarily due to an expired contract partially offset by 7 million higher maintenance spend in the steel business the 2018 increase was primarily due to higher production in the ref business of 11 million and new contracts in the onsite business of 8 million 

asset gains losses and impairments net decreased 26 million in 2019 and increased 7 million in 2018  the change in both periods was primarily due to higher losses incurred in 2018 including 15 million of a liability adjustment related to contingent consideration and an 8 million asset writeoff associated with the renewable business in anticipation of a contract ending in 2020 

other income and deductions increased 37 million in 2019 and 26 million in 2018  the 2019 increase was primarily due to the sale of membership interests in the ref business and higher equity earnings at various projects the 2018 increase was primarily due to higher production in the ref business of 20 million and decreased contributions to the dte energy foundation of 4 million 

income taxes — expense benefit decreased by 27 million in 2019 from the net benefit of 7 million in 2018 and by 35 million in 2018 from the net benefit of 42 million in 2017 the 2019 decrease was primarily due to the change in pretax income the 2018 decrease was primarily due to the 2017 remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 

income taxes — production tax credits decreased by 105 million in 2019 and increased 35 million in 2018  the 2019 decrease was primarily due to the sale of membership interests in the ref business the 2018 increase was primarily due to higher production in the ref business 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 17 million in 2019 and by 19 million in 2018  the 2019 decrease was primarily due to the sale of membership interests in the ref business the 2018 decrease was primarily due to termination of a project in the ref business 

outlook — in december 2019 power and industrial projects signed an agreement with south jersey industries “sji” to purchase an 8 mw combined heat and power generation facility that provides electricity and hot and chilled water to a hotel and casino in atlantic city new jersey the acquisition had a purchase price of 100 million and is expected to close in early 2020 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy and renewable natural gas projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers in addition to optimizing the ref facilities until the phase out at the end of 2021 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power natural gas and environmental marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power environmental and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers energy trading results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations and purchased power and gas — nonutility decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower gas prices and increased in 2018 primarily due to higher volumes and higher gas prices primarily in the gas structured strategy 

nonutility margin increased 15 million in 2019 and decreased 60 million in 2018  the change in both periods was primarily due to timing from the unrealized and realized margins presented in the following tables 



 





 

 outlook — in the nearterm energy trading expects market conditions to remain challenging the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of rtos significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments physical power and natural gas contracts and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas and environmental inventory contracts for pipeline transportation storage assets and some environmental contracts are not derivatives as a result energy trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets energy tradings strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

corporate and other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and holds energyrelated investments the 2019 net loss of 116 million represents a decrease of 13 million from the 2018 net loss of 129 million primarily due to lower state income taxes and decreased contributions to notforprofit organizations partially offset by higher interest expense and impairment of an equity method investment the 2018 net loss of 129 million represents an increase of 26 million from the 2017 net loss of 103 million primarily due to a reduction in the corporate tax rate from the tcja in december 2017 higher interest expense and increased contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in 2017

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

dte energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities to grow the nonutility businesses to retire and pay interest on longterm debt and to pay dividends dte energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements dte energy expects that cash from operations in 2020 will be approximately 30 billion  dte energy anticipates base level utility capital investments including environmental renewable and energy waste reduction expenditures expenditures for nonutility businesses and contributions to equity method investees in 2020 of approximately 45 billion  dte energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of dte energys operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric retail access regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

net cash from operations decreased 31 million in 2019  the reduction is primarily due to a decrease in cash from working capital items partially offset by an increase in noncash and nonoperating items primarily deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 

net cash from operations increased 563 million in 2018  the increase in operating cash flows reflects an increase in adjustments for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation and amortization and working capital adjustments partially offset by a decrease to deferred income taxes 

the change in working capital items in 2019 was primarily related to an increase in cash used for accounts payable and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by cash received related to accounts receivable accrued pension and postretirement costs and regulatory assets and liabilities the change in working capital items in 2018 primarily related to increases in cash from accounts receivable accrued pension liability derivative assets and liabilities and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by increases of cash used for equity earnings of equity method investees prepaid postretirement benefit costs accrued postretirement liability and regulatory assets and liabilities 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions in any given year dte energy looks to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within the nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth dte energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis dte energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria for new business lines dte energy initially invests based on research and analysis dte energy starts with a limited investment evaluates the results and either expands or exits the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of dte energy with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings 

net cash used for investing activities increased 24 billion in 2019 due primarily to dte energys acquisitions of midstream natural gas assets and renewable energy projects of 25 billion  net of cash acquired of 62 million as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  acquisitions  as well as an increase in plant and equipment expenditures partially offset by a reduction in contributions to equity method investees 

net cash used for investing activities increased 785 million in 2018 due primarily to an increase in plant and equipment expenditures and contributions to equity method investees principally to nexus 

cash from financing activities 

dte energy relies on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations 

dte energys strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity dte energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from financing activities increased 24 billion in 2019  the increase was primarily due to an increase in issuances of longterm debt equity units common stock and shortterm borrowings partially offset by an increase in redemptions of longterm debt and purchases of noncontrolling interests principally related to sgg the increased issuances in 2019 were primarily related to the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets see details disclosed in the acquisition financing section of note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  longterm debt  

net cash from financing activities increased 233 million in 2018  the increase was primarily due to the reduction of redemption of longterm debt and repurchases of common stock and an increase in issuance of longterm debt partially offset by an increase in cash used for repayments of shortterm borrowings and an increase in dividends on common stock 

outlook 

dte energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from the utility and nonutility businesses growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

dte energy may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future dte energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of longterm capital projects 

dte energy has approximately 687 million in longterm debt including finance leases maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 16 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2019  consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

dte energy expects to issue equity up to 300 million in 2020  at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates up to 185 million of these equity issuances will be made through contributions to the qualified pension plans including 160 million of dte electric contributions dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to the other postretirement plans in 2020  any additional equity issuances are expected to be made through other employee benefit plans 

various subsidiaries and equity investees of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as hard triggers state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as soft triggers are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2019  dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was 527 million  

dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all dte energys businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows 

see notes 10 11 15 17 19 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters   income taxes   longterm debt   shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings   commitments and contingencies  and  retirement benefits and trusteed assets  respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table details dte energys including dte electrics contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2019  



 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

in october 2019 moodys investors service downgraded dte energys unsecured debt rating from baa1 to baa2 following dte energys announcement to acquire midstream natural gas assets refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions  for additional information we do not expect the downgrade to negatively impact dte energys liquidity or access to the capital markets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the registrants consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements the registrants management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of the registrants businesses are subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses the registrants management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  

derivatives 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2019 and 2018  the registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values the registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the registrants estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices the registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts see the sensitivity analysis in item 7a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

goodwill 

certain of dte energys reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations dte energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test dte energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test dte energy estimates the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit for certain reporting units the fair values were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows and the market approach which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries the income approach includes a terminal value that utilizes an assumed longterm growth rate approach which incorporates managements assumptions regarding sustainable longterm growth of the reporting units the income approach cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance 

one of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies management selects comparable peers based on each peer’s primary business mix operations and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of the test date 

dte energy performs an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests dte energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while dte energy believes the assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact dte energys earnings 

dte energy performed its annual impairment test as of october 1 2019 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed 

the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the october 1 2019 valuation date 

 

 dte energy recognized additional goodwill of 171 million at the gas storage and pipelines reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the blue union and leap acquisition for further discussion see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions  

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined based on significant estimates and assumptions including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future market prices in some cases dte energy engages independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions  

longlived assets 

the registrants evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require the registrants to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact their earnings 

pension and other postretirement costs 

dte energy sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the registrants the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required dte energy considers historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

dte energy had pension costs of 112 million in 2019  148 million in 2018  and 172 million in 2017  other postretirement benefit credits were 1 million in 2019  36 million in 2018  and 31 million in 2017  pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for 2019 were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 730 for the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumptions dte energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets dte energys 2020 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 35 in equity markets 42 in fixed income markets including long duration bonds and 23 invested in other assets dte energys 2020 expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 35 in equity markets 37 in fixed income markets and 28 invested in other assets because of market volatility dte energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate dte energy is lowering its longterm rate of return assumption for the pension plans to 710 and lowering the other postretirement plans to 720 for 2020  dte energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rates of return on the plans assets for 2020 given their respective asset allocations and dtes capital market expectations dte energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions including its expected rate of return at least annually 

dte energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for the pension plans dte energy uses a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized favorable asset performance in 2019 resulted in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2019  dte energy had 186 million of cumulative gains related to investment performance in prior years that were not yet recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for the other postretirement benefit plans dte energy uses fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that dte energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans the discount rate determined on this basis was 328 for the pension and 329 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2019 compared to 440 for both the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2018  

dte energy changed the mortality assumption as of december 31 2019 to reflect the updated mp2019 projection scale the mortality assumptions used at december 31 2019 are the rp2014 mortality table projected back to 2006 using scale mp2014 projected forward to 2015 using scale mp2017 and projected beyond 2015 using scale mp2019 with generational projection the base mortality tables vary by type of plan employees union status and employment status with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population 

dte energy estimates the 2020 total pension costs will be approximately 120 million in 2020  compared to 112 million in 2019  the increase in total pension costs is primarily due to lower discount rates offset by favorable asset returns the 2020 other postretirement benefit credit will be approximately 40 million compared to 1 million in 2019  

the health care trend rates for dte energy assume 675 for pre65 participants and 725 for post65 participants for 2020  trending down to 450 for both pre65 and post65 participants in 2032 

future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2019 pension costs by approximately 45 million  lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2019 pension costs by approximately 22 million  lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2019 other postretirement credit by approximately 17 million  lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased the 2019 other postretirement credit by approximately 21 million  lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the other postretirement credit for 2019 by approximately 4 million  

the value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 68 billion at december 31 2019 and 60 billion at december 31 2018  at december 31 2019  dte energys qualified pension plans were underfunded by 677 million and its other postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by 68 million  in 2019  the funded status of the pension plans improved as plan sponsor contributions and favorable asset returns were partially offset by a decrease in discount rates the funded status of the other postretirement benefit plans improved as favorable asset returns and favorable healthcare experience were partially offset by a decrease in discount rates 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets dte energy made contributions to its qualified pension plans of 150 million in 2019 and 175 million in 2018  at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to 185 million in 2020 and up to 458 million over the next five years dte energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2019 or 2018  dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement plans in 2020 or over the next five years the planned pension contributions will be made in cash andor dte energy common stock

legal reserves 

the registrants are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon the registrants management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the registrants 

accounting for tax obligations 

the registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold the registrants also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the consolidated financial statements the registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2019 and 2018 are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the registrants consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts dte energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power natural gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items dte energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation contracts renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in the registrants reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the registrants manage their mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

the electric and gas businesses have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of coal natural gas uranium and electricity however the registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales and transportation services revenue at the gas segment the gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the registrants are exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

dte energys gas storage and pipelines segment has exposure to natural gas price fluctuations which impact the pricing for natural gas storage gathering and transportation dte energy manages its exposure through the use of short medium and longterm storage gathering and transportation contracts 

dte energys power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity natural gas and coal product price risk dte energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of longterm contracts 

dte energys energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas coal crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

dte energys power and industrial projects segment holds ownership interests in and operates five generating plants that sell electric output from renewable sources under longterm power purchase agreements with pge pge filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on january 29 2019 as of december 31 2019  pges account is substantially current and outstanding accounts receivable from pge are not material therefore dte energy determined no reserve was necessary 

as of december 31 2019  the book value of longlived assets used in producing electric output for sale to pge was approximately 101 million  the power and industrial projects segment also has equity investments including a note receivable of approximately 74 million in entities that sell power to pge in january 2019 following the bankruptcy filing dte energy performed an impairment analysis on its longlived assets based on its undiscounted cash flow projections dte energy determined it did no t have an impairment loss as of december 31 2018 dte energy also determined there was no t an otherthantemporary decline in its equity investments dte has not identified subsequent facts or circumstances that would cause a change to these conclusions through december 31 2019 dte energy’s assumptions and conclusions may change and it could have impairment losses if any of the terms of the contracts are not honored by pge or the contracts are rejected through the bankruptcy process 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the registrants regularly review contingent matters relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts the registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss 

trading activities 

dte energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations dte energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties 

the following table displays the credit quality of dte energys trading counterparties as of december 31 2019  



 

 other 

the registrants engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade the registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt in order to manage interest costs dte energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements dte energys exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and libor as of december 31 2019  dte energy had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of 48  

foreign currency exchange risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit dte energys exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations dte energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through december 2023  

summary of sensitivity analyses 

sensitivity analyses were performed on the fair values of commodity contracts for dte energy and longterm debt obligations for the registrants the commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at december 31 2019 and 2018 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance that qualifying customers receive dte electric works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte electric also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to customers 

strategy and competition 

dte electrics electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner with potential capacity constraints in the miso region there will be increased dependency on dte electrics generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers this generation will require continuing investments in dte electrics primary coal generating units a natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility and renewables 

dte electrics distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to customers dte electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

 11 

the electric retail access program in michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2018  2017  and 2016  and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total retail access related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on dte electrics financial performance and full service customer rates energy legislation passed in 2016 retained the 10 retail access cap with some revisions dte electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales in 2019  

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers dte electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the risk factors in item 1a of this report

strategy and competition 

dte gas strategy is to ensure the safe reliable and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in michigan in addition dte gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to underserved markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces water heaters and appliances within its current customer base dte gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy waste reduction products and services to its customers making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for enduser transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for dte gas enduser transportation service dte gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by its storage capacity 

having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of dte gas storage and transportation services to gas producers marketers distribution companies enduser customers and other pipeline companies the business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers the following table summarizes dte energys including dte electrics estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations pending or future reconsiderations of current regulations may impact the estimated expenditures summarized in the table below the amounts reported in the table do not include any expenditures related to the epa clean power plan that has been stayed as discussed below actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



water  — the epa finalized regulations on cooling water intake in august 2014 dte electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes 

contaminated and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites dte gas owns or previously owned 14 such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites dte energy anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse effect on dte energys operations dte electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site 

 18 

the registrants are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electric distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the registrants financial position and cash flows and the rates charged to their customers 

coal combustion residuals and effluent limitations guidelines — in april 2015 the epa published a final rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals commonly known as coal ash the rule became effective in october 2015 the rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a nonhazardous waste and relies on various selfimplementation design and performance standards dte electric owns and operates three  permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coalfired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants at certain facilities the rule requires the installation of monitoring wells compliance with groundwater standards and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant at other facilities the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks in 2018 dte electric updated its estimated expenditures to remediate accordingly on october 12 2018 a dc district court decision became effective that may affect the timing of closure of coal ash impoundments that are not lined with an engineered liner system in 2019 the epa is expected to affirmatively undertake rulemaking to implement the dc district courts decision that will determine any changes to dte electrics plans in the operations and closure of coal ash impoundments 

in november 2015 the epa finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which requires additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023 the initial costs to comply with this rule are under development and estimates are included in the coal combustion residual and effluent limitations guidelines amount in the above table 

on april 12 2017 the epa granted a petition for reconsideration of the elg rule the epa also signed an administrative stay of the elg rule’s compliance deadlines for fly ash transport water bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization fgd wastewater among others on june 6 2017 the epa published in the federal register a proposed rule to postpone certain applicable deadlines within the elg rule the final rule was published on september 18 2017 the final rule nullified the administrative stay but also extended the earliest compliance deadlines for the fgd wastewater and bottom ash transport water until november 1 2020 in order for the epa to propose and finalize a new ruling the elg compliance requirements and final deadlines for bottom ash transport water and fgd wastewater and total elg related compliance costs will not be known until the epa completes its reconsideration of the elg rule 

air  — dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of so 2  and no x  the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce so 2  no x  mercury and other emissions these rulemakings could require additional controls for so 2  no x  and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures to comply with air pollution requirements through 2025  pending the results of future rulemakings 

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing fossilfuel egus in february 2016 the us supreme court granted petitioners requests for a stay of the carbon rules for existing egus also known as the epa clean power plan pending final review by the courts the clean power plan has no legal effect while the stay is in place in october 2017 the epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and in august 2018 the epa issued its proposed affordable clean energy rule to replace the clean power plan in addition in december 2018 the epa issued proposed revisions to the carbon dioxide standards for new modified or reconstructed fossilfuel fired egus the carbon dioxide standard for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on dte electric since dte electric has no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards these proposed rules do not impact dte energys goal to reduce carbon emissions 30 by the early 2020s 45 by 2030 75 by 2040 and more than 80 by 2050 

 19 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc

employees 

dte energy and its subsidiaries had approximately 10600  employees as of december 31 2018  of which approximately 5200  were represented by unions dte electric had approximately 4900  employees as of december 31 2018  of which approximately 2800  were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for dte energy subsidiaries represented employees the majority of represented employees for both dte energy and dte electric are under contracts that expire in 2020  and 2021  




 item 1a  risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of the registrants utility businesses and dte energys nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the registrants below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses although the registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect performance 

the registrants are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization the registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies the registrants ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations regulators may also disagree with the registrants rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business if the registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact the registrants ability to recover certain costs through customer rates regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for the registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers the registrants cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how the business operates impact the registrants ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery or require the registrants to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric retail access program could negatively impact the registrants financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for dte electric customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes the registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity 

 20 

the registrants electric distribution system and dte energys gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation which could reduce revenues increase expenses and have a material adverse effect on their business financial position and results of operations the registrants electric distribution and dte energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks these operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years equipment even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices is subject to operational failure including events that are beyond the registrants control and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently because the registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of the registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties 

dte energys nonutility businesses may not perform to its expectations  dte energy relies on nonutility operations for an increasing portion of earnings if dte energys current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels dte energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value 

dte energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from the utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

the registrants businesses have safety risks the registrants electric distribution system power plants renewable energy equipment and other facilities and dte energys gas distribution system gas infrastructure and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury death or property loss to employees customers third parties or the public although the registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident they could experience financial loss damage to their reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

environmental laws and liability may be costly the registrants are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in the registrants generation fleet and for dte energys gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require the registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals the registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally the registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body the registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

the registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulations of ghg emissions are implemented the operations of dte electrics fossilfueled generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process the registrants financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

for dte energy future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of dte energys gas transportation businesses 

threats of cyber incidents physical security and terrorism could affect the registrants business issues may threaten the registrants such as cyber incidents physical security or terrorism that may disrupt the registrants operations and could harm the registrants operating results 

 21 

information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches the registrants industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents physical security threats acts of war or terrorism and other causes as well as loss of operational control of the registrants electric generation and distribution assets and dte energys gas distribution assets if the registrants information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way the registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business operating results and financial condition 

suppliers vendors contractors and information technology providers have access to systems that support the registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data a breach of these thirdparty systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system also  because the registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility electric generator system operator or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the registrants’ businesses operating results and financial condition 

in addition the registrants generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and dte energys gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products the registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the registrants cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the registrants in connection with the registrants businesses they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers shareholders and employees customers shareholders and employees expect that the registrants will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the registrants reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

construction and capital improvements to the registrants power facilities dte energys distribution systems and its gas storage and pipelines business subject them to risk   the registrants are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at the registrants multiple power generation and distribution facilities at dte energys gas distribution system and at dte energys gas storage and pipelines business many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the registrants control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals including required certificates from regulatory agencies construction disputes impediments to acquiring rightsofway or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms cost overruns and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the registrants financial performance operations or expected investment returns at the affected facilities businesses and development projects 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects the registrants to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the registrants to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options insurance maintained by the registrants for various nuclearrelated risks may not be sufficient to cover the registrants costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant which may affect the registrants financial performance in addition the registrants nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning a decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the registrants’ liquidity financial position or results of operations 

 22 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact the registrants financial results the registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations dte energys access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers dte energys nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts dte electric charges utility customers for electricity and dte gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of dte energys nonutility businesses the registrants hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and for dte energy nonutility businesses and the registrants financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for dte energys nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact the registrants financial results  the registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of their facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the registrants utility products and for dte energy on the profitability of the nonutility businesses 

emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the registrants  advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include costeffective renewable energy technologies distributed generation energy waste reduction technologies and energy storage devices such developments may impact the price of energy may affect energy deliveries as customerowned generation becomes more costeffective may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply andor distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy each of these factors could materially affect the registrants’ results of operations cash flows or financial position 

adverse changes in the registrants credit ratings may negatively affect them regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in the registrants economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in the registrants credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in the registrants credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact their liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the registrants liquidity and results of operations the registrants costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and the registrants required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the registrants plans the registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below the registrants projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the registrants utility customers the results of operations and financial position of the registrants could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets the registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the registrants cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 23 

the registrants ability to access capital markets is important the registrants ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain the registrants ability as well as the ability of their subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the registrants access to capital markets the registrants longterm revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2022  but the registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the registrants utilities and dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

dte energys participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations dte energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed dte energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose dte energy to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks dte energys trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines dte energy sets resulting from the management of dte energys business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish dte energys financial results and financial position dte energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

weather significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the registrants earnings and cash flows mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the registrants assets lowering income and cash flows at dte electric ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance the registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation the registrants financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs 

regional national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the registrants the registrants utility and dte energys nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with should the financial conditions of some of dte energys significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional national or international economic conditions reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services dte energy supplies collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows 

renewable portfolio standards and energy waste reduction programs may affect the registrants business the registrants are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy the registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future in addition the registrants expect to comply with new michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

the registrants are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the registrants revenues as customers decrease their energy usage the registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results 

 24 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the registrants ’  operations the registrants businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the registrants business and future operating results in addition the registrants have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations 

a work interruption may adversely affect the registrants  there are several bargaining units for dte energys approximately 5200  and dte electrics approximately 2800  represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2020  and 2021  a union choosing to strike would have an impact on the registrants businesses the registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance 

dte energys ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources dte energy generated production tax credits from coke production renewable gas recovery reduced emission fuel and gas production operations and for the registrants renewable energy generation if the registrants production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit or changes in tax law there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the registrants earnings and cash flows 

if dte energys goodwill becomes impaired it may be required to record a charge to earnings dte energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of dte energy goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in the industry dte energy cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable dte energy may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact dte energys results of operations and financial position 

the registrants may not be fully covered by insurance the registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters war terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the registrants operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or the registrants insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following combined discussion is separately filed by dte energy and dte electric however dte electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to dte energy or the subsidiaries of dte energy other than itself 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2018  operating revenues of approximately 142 billion  and total assets of approximately 363 billion  dte energy is the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan dte energy operates three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes dte energys financial results 



the decrease  in 2018   net income attributable to dte energy company  was primarily due to lower earnings in the gas storage and pipelines energy trading and corporate and other segments partially offset by higher earnings in the electric gas and power and industrial projects segments the 2018   decrease  was partially attributable to trueup adjustments for the remeasurement of deferred taxes of 21 million as the adjustments increased income tax expense of which 17 million was attributable to the regulated utilities and increased regulatory liabilities the increase  in 2017   net income attributable to dte energy company  was primarily due to higher earnings in the gas storage and pipelines energy trading and power and industrial projects segments partially offset by lower earnings in the corporate and other segment the 2017   increase  was also due to 105 million of net income tax benefit related to the enactment of the tcja 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

 29 

dte energys utilities are investing capital to improve customer reliability through investments in base infrastructure and new generation and to comply with environmental requirements dte energy expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte energy is focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability dte energy operates in a constructive regulatory environment and has solid relationships with its regulators 

in may 2017 dte energy announced its plan to reduce carbon emissions this goal will be attained by cutting carbon emissions 30 by the early 2020s 45 by 2030 75 by 2040 and more than 80 by 2050 to achieve this reduction dte energy will transition away from coalpowered sources and incorporate more renewable energy energy waste reduction projects demand response and natural gas fueled generation dte energy has already begun the transition in the way it produces power through the continued retirement of its aging coalfired plants in may 2018 dte energy announced its plans to accelerate its clean energy initiatives by targeting at least a 50 clean energy goal by 2030 to be achieved through a combination of investments in renewable energy and energy waste reduction projects refer to the capital investments section below for further discussion 

dte energy has significant investments in nonutility businesses dte energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets skills and expertise and provides diversity in earnings and geography specifically dte energy invests in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile dte energy expects growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity dte energy has an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

dte energys utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

dte electrics capital investments over the 20192023  period are estimated at 113 billion  comprised of 40 billion  for capital replacements and other projects 46 billion  for distribution infrastructure and 27 billion  for new generation dte electric has retired four coalfired generation units at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities and has announced plans to retire its remaining thirteen coalfired generating units seven of these coalfired generating units will be retired through 2023 at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities the remaining coalfired generating units at the belle river and monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040 the retired facilities will be replaced with renewables energy waste reduction demand response and natural gas fueled generation in april 2018 dte electric received approval from the mpsc to build a natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility to provide approximately 1100 megawatts of energy beginning in 2022 in august 2018 dte electric began construction on its natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility in march 2018 dte electric filed its 2018 renewable energy plan with the mpsc proposing approximately 1000 additional megawatts of energy from new wind and solar projects to be completed by 2022 the mpsc had previously approved 300 of the 1000 additional megawatts for wind projects in an mpsc order received in september 2016 in january 2018 dte electric filed with the mpsc its fiveyear distribution operations investment and maintenance plan to improve system reliability dte electric plans to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment for further discussion of regulatory matters see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  

dte gas capital investments over the 20192023  period are estimated at 25 billion  comprised of 12 billion  for base infrastructure and 13 billion  for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs dte gas plans to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment 

dte energys nonutility businesses capital investments are primarily for expansion growth and ongoing maintenance gas storage and pipelines capital investments over the 20192023  period are estimated at 40 billion  to 50 billion  for gathering and pipeline investments and expansions power and industrial projects capital investments over the 20192023  period are estimated at 10 billion  to 14 billion  for industrial energy services and rng projects

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially the registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers as authorized by the mpsc 

air  — dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of so 2  and no x  the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce so 2  no x  mercury and other emissions additional rulemakings may occur over the next few years which could require additional controls for so 2  no x  and other hazardous air pollutants to comply with existing requirements dte electric spent approximately 24 billion  through 2018  dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures through 2025  

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions in 2015 the epa finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing egus in february 2016 the us supreme court granted petitioners requests for a stay of the carbon rules for existing egus also known as the epa clean power plan pending final review by the courts the clean power plan has no legal effect while the stay is in place on march 28 2017 a presidential executive order was issued on promoting energy independence and economic growth the order instructs the epa to review and if appropriate suspend revise or rescind the clean power plan rule following the issuance of this order the federal government requested the us court of appeals for the dc circuit to hold all legal challenges in abeyance until the review of these regulations is completed on october 10 2017 the epa proposed to rescind the clean power plan and announced its intent to issue an anpr seeking input as to whether it should replace the rule and if so what form it should take in august 2018 the epa proposed revised emission guidelines for ghgs from existing electric utility generating units the proposed rule named the affordable clean energy ace rule is intended to replace the clean power plan rule comments on the proposed ace rule were due on october 31 2018 it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the epas proposed ace rule on existing sources at this time 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

increased costs for energy produced from traditional coalbased sources due to recent pending and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable natural gas fueled generation andor nuclear sources energy waste reduction initiatives and the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon instruments which could provide new business opportunities for dte energys utility and nonutility segments at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on the registrants or their customers 

see items 1 and 2 business and properties and note 18  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  commitments and contingencies  for further discussion of environmental matters

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry dte energys strong utility base combined with its integrated nonutility operations position it well for longterm growth 

looking forward dte energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance 

 dte energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as the nongaap financial measures utility margin and nonutility margin discussed below which dte energy uses as measures of its operational performance generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

dte energy uses utility margin and nonutility margin nongaap financial measures to assess its performance by reportable segment 

utility margin includes electric and gas operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses the utilities’ fuel purchased power and natural gas supply are passed through to customers and therefore result in changes to the utilities’ revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses as such dte energy believes utility margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the utilities’ operations across periods as it excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses 

the nonutility margin relates to the power and industrial projects and energy trading segments for the power and industrial projects segment nonutility margin primarily includes operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses operating revenues include sales of refined coal to third parties and the affiliated electric utility metallurgical coke and related byproducts petroleum coke renewable natural gas and electricity as well as rental income and revenues from utilitytype consulting management and operational services for the energy trading segment nonutility margin includes revenue and realized and unrealized gains and losses from physical and financial power and gas marketing optimization and trading activities net of purchased power and gas related to these activities dte energy evaluates its operating performance of these nonutility businesses using the measure of operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses 

 32 

utility margin and nonutility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap utility margin and nonutility margin do not intend to represent operating income the most comparable gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of dte energys segments segment information described below includes intercompany revenues and expenses and other income and deductions that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 



electric 

the results of operations discussion for dte electric is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with general instruction i 2 a of form 10k for whollyowned subsidiaries 

the electric segment consists principally of dte electric electric results are discussed below 



see dte electrics consolidated statements of operations in item 8 of this report for a complete view of its results for an explanation of differences between the electric segment and dte electrics consolidated statements of operations refer to note 20  to the consolidated financial statements  retirement benefits and trusteed assets  

utility margin   increased   98 million  in 2018  and decreased   45 million  in 2017  revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the registrants consolidated statements of operations 

 33 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





 

 dte electric sales increased for residential commercial and industrial primarily due to favorable weather in 2018 

operation and maintenance  expense increased   55 million  in 2018  and decreased   26 million  in 2017  the increase  in 2018  was primarily due to increased uncollectible expense of 34 million due to customer billing initiatives following implementation of the new billing system increased power plant generation expense of 24 million an increase in energy waste reduction expense of 10 million to meet higher energy savings targets partially offset by decreased distribution operations expense of 13 million   the decrease  in 2017  was primarily due to decreased power plant generation expenses of 66 million partially offset by increased storm restoration expenses of 27 million and increased line clearance expenses of 10 million the decrease in power plant generation includes an increase of 6 million of costs related to the 2016 fire at a generation facility offset by 21 million of insurance proceeds received in 2017 

depreciation and amortization  expense increased   83 million  in 2018  and increased   3 million  in 2017  in 2018  the increase  was primarily due to an increase to depreciable base of 46 million and an increase of 42 million associated with the trm partially offset by a decrease in regulatory asset amortization of 5 million in 2017  the increase  was due to 45 million of increased expense from an increased depreciable base partially offset by a decrease of 29 million associated with the trm and a decrease of 13 million in amortization of regulatory assets

other income and deductions   increased   26 million  in 2018  and increased   8 million  in 2017  the increase  in 2018  was primarily due to higher interest expense of 9 million and change in investment earnings loss of 11 million in 2018 compared to a gain of 26 million in 2017 partially offset by decreased nonoperating retirement benefits expense of 13 million and a contribution to the dte energy foundation of 7 million in 2017 the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to higher interest expense of 10 million lower interest income of 8 million related to a sales and use tax settlement received in 2016 and a 7 million contribution to the dte energy foundation partially offset by 12 million of higher investment earnings and a 3 million decrease in low income selfsufficiency plan lsp contributions to notforprofit organizations in 2016 

outlook   —  dte electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while keeping customer rate increases affordable looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and effects of energy waste reduction programs 

dte electric filed a rate case with the mpsc on july 6 2018 requesting an increase in base rates of 328 million  based on a projected twelvemonth period ending april 30 2020 the requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments depreciation expense as requested in the 2016 dte electric depreciation case filing and reliability improvement projects the rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 100  to 105  and includes projected changes in sales operation and maintenance expenses and working capital in addition the rate filing requests an infrastructure recovery mechanism to recover the incremental revenue requirement associated with certain distribution fossil generation and nuclear generation capital expenditures through 2022 dte electric also included calculation c in this filing to address all remaining issues relative to the enactment of the tcja which is primarily the remeasurement of deferred taxes and how the amounts deferred as regulatory liabilities will flow to ratepayers a final mpsc order in this case is expected by may 2019 refer to note 9  to the consolidated financial statements “ regulatory matters ” for additional information 

gas 

the gas segment consists principally of dte gas gas results are discussed below 



utility margin   increased   45 million  in 2018  and increased   75 million  in 2017  revenues associated with certain surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in dte energys consolidated statements of operations 

 35 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





operation and maintenance  expense increased   53 million  in 2018  and increased   9 million  in 2017  the increase  in 2018  was primarily due to increased uncollectible expense of 28 million due to customer billing initiatives following implementation of a new customer billing system and higher gas operations expenses of 22 million which included increased investment spending and higher pipeline integrity expenses the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to increased corporate expenses of 3 million and increased gas operations expenses of 3 million 

depreciation and amortization   expense increased   10 million  in 2018  and increased   17 million  in 2017  the increase  in 2018  was primarily due to an increased depreciable base the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to an increased depreciable base and higher depreciation rates 

other income and deductions   decreased   19 million  in 2018  and increased   43 million  in 2017  the decrease  in 2018  was primarily due to lower contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations of 27 million partially offset by higher net interest expense of 6 million the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to increased nonoperating retirement benefits expenses of 31 million increased contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations of 7 million and higher interest expense of 5 million 

outlook —  dte gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs dte gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

dte filed its calculation c case with the mpsc on november 16 2018 to reduce the revenue requirement by 12 million related to the amortization of deferred tax remeasurement calculation c addresses all remaining issues relative to the enactment of the tcja which is primarily the remeasurement of deferred taxes and how the amounts deferred as regulatory liabilities will flow to ratepayers refer to note 9  to the consolidated financial statements “ regulatory matters ” for additional information

gas storage and pipelines 

the gas storage and pipelines segment consists of the nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations   increased   32 million  in 2018  and increased   151 million  in 2017  the increase  in both periods was primarily due to increased pipeline and gathering volumes the 2017   increase  was also due to the acquisition of ags and sgg in october 2016 

cost of gas — nonutility   decreased   8 million  in 2018  and increased   24 million  in 2017  the 2018 decrease  was driven by lower physical purchases of gas from ags customers for resale to optimize available transportation capacity the 2017   increase  was driven by higher physical purchases of gas from ags customers for resale to optimize available transportation capacity 

operation and maintenance   expense increased   20 million  in 2018  and increased   2 million  in 2017  the 2018   increase  was primarily due to increased labor related expenses and additional compression activity on the bluestone pipeline and susquehanna gathering systems 

depreciation and amortization  expense increased   6 million  in 2018  and increased   31 million  in 2017  the 2017   increase  was primarily due to the acquisition of ags and sgg in october 2016 

other income and deductions   increased   43 million  in 2018  and decreased   13 million  in 2017  the 2018   increase  was primarily due to increased earnings from pipeline investments and a 16 million net loss on extinguishment of debt within the storage business in 2017 partially offset by higher interest expense the 2017   decrease  was primarily due to a 16 million net loss on extinguishment of debt within the storage business and contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations partially offset by increased earnings from pipeline investments 

income tax expense benefit   increased 98 million  in 2018  and decreased 101 million  in 2017  the changes were primarily driven by the 115 million remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 the 2017 change was partially offset by increased tax expense on higher earnings in 2017 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   increased   1 million  in 2018  and increased   20 million  in 2017  the 2017 increase  was primarily due to the acquisition of sgg in october 2016 

outlook —  dte energy believes its longterm agreements with producers and the quality of the natural gas reserves in the marcellusutica region soundly position the gathering systems for future revenues 

nexus pipeline was placed in service in in october 2018 the nexus pipeline provides a transportation path for appalachian basin shale gas including utica and marcellus shale gas directly to consuming markets in northern ohio southeastern michigan and dawn ontario dte energy owns a 50 partnership interest in the nexus pipeline with an investment balance of 126 billion  at december 31 2018  

 37 

on january 11 2019 nexus signed an agreement to purchase generation pipeline llc a public utility regulated by the public utilities commission of ohio this 23mile pipeline system supplies gas to industrial customers in the toledo oh area has existing interconnects with anr pipeline company and panhandle eastern pipeline company and is located 4 miles away from nexus the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019 upon regulatory approvals 

ags and sgg provide a platform for midstream growth and access to further investment opportunities in the appalachian basin an additional connection to the nexus pipeline which should drive incremental volumes on the nexus pipeline and producer relationships that may lead to more partnering opportunities 

gas storage and pipelines expects to maintain its steady growth by developing an asset portfolio with multiple growth platforms through investment in new projects and expansions gas storage and pipelines will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other storage and pipeline projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects 

the power and industrial projects segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity and pipelinequality gas from renewable energy projects power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



 38 

operating revenues — nonutility operations   increased   115 million  in 2018  and increased   183 million  in 2017  the changes are due to the following 



nonutility margin   increased   40 million  in 2018  and increased   10 million  in 2017  the changes are due to the following 



operation and maintenance  expense increased   21 million  in 2018  and increased   25 million  in 2017  the 2018   increase  was primarily due to higher production in the ref business of 11 million and new contracts in the onsite business of 8 million the 2017   increase  was primarily due to an increase in maintenance spending driven by improved conditions in the steel business of 16 million higher maintenance and a new acquisition in the renewables business of 7 million and an increase associated with new projects in the ref business of 5 million offset by lower spending as a result of shenango plant closure activities in the first half of 2016 of 6 million 

asset gains losses and impairments net   increased   7 million  in 2018  from the net loss  of 20 million  in 2017  and decreased   21 million  in 2017  from the net gain  of 1 million  in 2016  the 2018   increase  was primarily due to 15 million of a liability adjustment related to contingent consideration and an 8 million asset writeoff associated with the renewable business in anticipation of a contract ending in 2020 the 2017   decrease  was primarily due to an impairment in the ref business of 14 million and an impairment of a petroleum coke project of 6 million 

 39 

other income and deductions   increased   26 million  in 2018  and increased   14 million  in 2017  the 2018   increase  was primarily due to higher production in the ref business of 20 million and decreased contributions to the dte energy foundation of 4 million the 2017   increase  was primarily due to increased equity earnings in the renewable business of 9 million and insurance settlements in the renewable and ref businesses of 6 million offset by increased contributions to the dte energy foundation of 6 million 

income taxes — benefit   decreased  by 35 million  in 2018  and increased  by 16 million  in 2017  the 2018   decrease  was primarily due to the 2017 remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 of 21 million an increase due to higher pretax loss of 7 million and a decrease due to a worthless stock deduction associated with the shenango closure in 2016 of 10 million 

income taxes — production tax credits   increased  by 35 million  in 2018  and increased   39 million  in 2017  the increase  in both periods was primarily due to higher production in the ref business 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests   decreased  by 19 million  in 2018  and increased  by 8 million  in 2017  the 2018   decrease  was primarily due to termination of a project in the ref business the 2017   increase  was primarily due to a change in the ownership percentage in one of the ref projects of 8 million 

outlook —  power and industrial projects has constructed and placed in service ref facilities at ten sites including facilities located at seven thirdparty owned coalfired power plants dte energy has sold membership interests in five of the facilities and entered into lease arrangements in three of the facilities three ref facilities will phase out in 2019 with the remaining seven to be phased out at the end of 2021 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and natural gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers energy trading results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations   and   purchased power and gas — nonutility  were impacted primarily by an increase in volumes as well as an increase in gas prices for the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  primarily in the gas structured strategy 

 40 

nonutility margin   decreased   60 million  in 2018  and increased   177 million  in 2017  the change in both periods was primarily due to timing from the unrealized and realized margins presented in the following tables 



 

 

 

 other income and deductions   increased   1 million  in 2018  and decreased   27 million  in 2017  due to contributions to the dte energy foundation in 2016 

outlook —  in the nearterm energy trading expects market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of rtos significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result energy trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets energy tradings strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

 41 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and holds energyrelated investments the 2018   net loss  of 129 million  represents an increase  of 26 million  from the 2017   net loss  of 103 million  primarily due to a reduction in the corporate tax rate from the tcja in december 2017 higher interest expense and increased contributions to other notforprofit organizations partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in 2017 the 2017   net loss  of 103 million  represents an increase  of 42 million  from the 2016   net loss  of 61 million  primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 resulting in income tax expense of 34 million and the contribution of land and improvements to the dte energy beacon park foundation 

see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  income taxes  

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

dte energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities to grow the nonutility businesses to retire and pay interest on longterm debt and to pay dividends dte energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements dte energy expects that cash from operations in 2019  will be approximately 24 billion  dte energy anticipates base level utility capital investments including environmental renewable and energy waste reduction expenditures expenditures for nonutility businesses and contributions to equity method investees in 2019  of approximately 39 billion  dte energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

 42 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of dte energys operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric retail access regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

cash from operations increased   563 million  in 2018  the increase  in operating cash flows reflects an increase in adjustments for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation and amortization and working capital adjustments partially offset by a decrease to deferred income taxes 

cash from operations increased   33 million  in 2017  the increase  in operating cash flows reflects an increase in net income and adjustments for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation and amortization and asset gains losses and impairments partially offset by a decrease to deferred income taxes and working capital adjustments 

the change in working capital items in 2018  primarily related to increases in cash from accounts receivable accrued pension liability derivative assets and liabilities and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by increases of cash used for equity earnings of equity method investees prepaid postretirement benefit costs accrued postretirement liability and regulatory assets and liabilities the change in working capital items in 2017  primarily related to increases of cash used for accounts receivable inventories accrued pension liability derivative assets and liabilities equity earnings of equity method investees and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by increases in cash from the accrued postretirement liability and regulatory assets and liabilities 

 43 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures in any given year dte energy looks to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within the nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth dte energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis dte energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria for new business lines dte energy initially invests based on research and analysis dte energy starts with a limited investment evaluates the results and either expands or exits the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of dte energy with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings 

net cash used for  investing activities increased   785 million  in 2018  due primarily to an increase in plant and equipment expenditures and contributions to equity method investees principally to nexus 

net cash used for  investing activities decreased   828 million  in 2017  due primarily to dte energys 2016 acquisition of midstream natural gas assets partially offset by increased plant and equipment expenditures contributions to equity method investees principally to nexus and two acquisitions of renewable gas recovery sites which are presented in investing activities — other 

cash from financing activities 

dte energy relies on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations 

dte energys strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity dte energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from  financing activities increased   233 million  in 2018  the increase  was primarily due to the reduction of redemption of longterm debt and repurchases of common stock and an increase in issuance of longterm debt partially offset by an increase in cash used for repayments of shortterm borrowings and an increase in dividends on common stock 

net cash from  financing activities decreased   938 million  in 2017  the decrease  was primarily due to a decrease in issuances of longterm debt and equity units contributions from noncontrolling interests an increase in dividends on common stock and distributions to noncontrolling interests partially offset by an increase to shortterm borrowings and a decrease to redemptions and repurchases of longterm debt 

outlook 

dte energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from the utility and nonutility businesses growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

dte energy may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future dte energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of longterm capital projects 

dte energy has approximately 15 billion  in longterm debt including capital leases maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

 44 

dte energy has approximately 14 billion  of available liquidity at december 31 2018  consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

dte energy expects to issue equity up to 250 million  in 2019  through the pension and other employee benefit plans which is exclusive from any amounts related to the equity units described in note 14  to the consolidated financial statements  longterm debt  

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making up to 150 million  in contributions including 100 million  of dte electric contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2019  dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to the other postretirement plans in 2019  

various subsidiaries and equity investees of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as hard triggers state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as soft triggers are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2018  dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was approximately 638 million  

dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of dte energys businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows 

see notes 9 10 14 16 18 and 20  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters   income taxes   longterm debt   shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings   commitments and contingencies  and  retirement benefits and trusteed assets  respectively

contractual obligations 

the following table details dte energys including dte electrics contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2018  



 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

 46 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the registrants consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements the registrants management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of the registrants businesses are subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses the registrants management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  

derivatives 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2018  and 2017  the registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values the registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the registrants estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices the registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts see the sensitivity analysis in item 7a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 12 and 13  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of dte energys reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations dte energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

 47 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test dte energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test dte energy estimates the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple or assumed longterm growth rate approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities or managements assumptions regarding sustainable longterm growth of the reporting units respectively these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance dte energy also employs marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

dte energy performs an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests dte energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while dte energy believes the assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact dte energys earnings 

dte energy performed its annual impairment test as of october 1 2018  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed 

the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the october 1 2018  valuation date 



 

 longlived assets 

the registrants evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require the registrants to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact their earnings 

 48 

pension and other postretirement costs 

dte energy sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the registrants the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required dte energy considers historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

dte energy had pension costs of 148 million  in 2018  172 million  in 2017  and 167 million  in 2016  other postretirement benefit credits were 36 million  in 2018  31 million  in 2017  and 111 million  in 2016  pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for 2018  were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 750  for the pension plans and 775  for the other postretirement benefit plans in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumptions dte energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets dte energys 2019  expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 35  in equity markets 42  in fixed income markets including long duration bonds and 23  invested in other assets dte energys 2019  expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 39  in equity markets 28  in fixed income markets and 33  invested in other assets because of market volatility dte energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate dte energy is lowering its longterm rate of return assumption for the pension plans to 730  and maintaining the other postretirement plans at 775  for 2019  dte energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rates of return on the plans assets for 2019  given their respective asset allocations and dtes capital market expectations dte energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions including its expected rate of return at least annually 

dte energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for the pension plans dte energy uses a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized negative asset performance in 2018  resulted in unrecognized net losses as of december 31 2018  dte energy had 248 million  of cumulative losses related to investment performance in 2018  and 2017  that were not yet recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for the other postretirement benefit plans dte energy uses fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that dte energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans the discount rate determined on this basis was 440  for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2018  compared to 370  for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2017  

dte energy changed the mortality assumption as of december 31 2018 to reflect the updated mp2018 projection scale along with the actual experience and credibility of each population the mortality assumptions used at december 31 2018  are the rp2014 mortality table projected back to 2006 using the scale mp2014 projected forward to 2015 using the scale mp2017 and projected beyond 2015 using the scale mp2018 with generational projection the base mortality tables vary by type of plan employees union status and employment status with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population 

 49 

dte energy estimates the 2019  total pension costs will be approximately 100 million  in 2019  compared to 148 million  in 2018 the reduction in total pension costs is primarily due to updated demographic assumptions and favorable discount rates offset by lower asset returns the 2019  other postretirement benefit credit will be approximately 45 million  compared to 36 million  in 2018  

the health care trend rates for dte energy assume 675  for pre65 participants and 725  for post65 participants for 2019  trending down to 450  for both pre65 and post65 participants in 2031 

future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2018  pension costs by approximately 44 million  lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2018  pension costs by approximately 24 million  lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2018  other postretirement credit by approximately 18 million  lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have decreased the 2018  other postretirement credit by approximately 27 million  lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the other postretirement credit for 2018  by approximately 4 million  

the value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 60 billion  at december 31 2018  and 65 billion  at december 31 2017  at december 31 2018  dte energys qualified pension plans were underfunded by 720 million  and its other postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by 44 million  in 2018  the funded status of the pension plans improved as plan sponsor contributions and an increase in discount rates were partially offset by negative asset returns the funded status of the other postretirement benefit plans improved as an increase in discount rates and favorable healthcare experience were partially offset by negative asset returns 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets dte energy made contributions to its qualified pension plans of 175 million  in 2018  and 223 million  in 2017  at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to 150 million  in 2019  and up to 700 million  over the next five years dte energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2018  or 2017  dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement plans in 2019  or over the next five years the planned pension contributions will be made in cash andor dte energy common stock

legal reserves 

the registrants are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon the registrants management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the registrants 

accounting for tax obligations 

the registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold the registrants also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

 50 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the consolidated financial statements the registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2018  and 2017  are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the registrants consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts dte energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power natural gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items dte energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation contracts renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 12 and 13  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in the registrants reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the registrants manage their mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value

weather economic factors competition energy efficiency initiatives and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers dte electrics peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands dte electrics operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte electric 

fuel supply and purchased power 

dte electrics power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power dte electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers dte electrics generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms dte electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases dte electric has longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 267 million tons of lowsulfur western coal and approximately 1 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2018  to 2021 all of these contracts have pricing schedules dte electric has approximately 94 of the expected coal requirements for 2018 under contract given the geographic diversity of supply dte electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements dte electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western and eastern coal rail requirements under contract through 2021 contracts covering expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities are under contract through 2019 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso dte electric offers its generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load dte electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance that qualifying customers receive dte electric works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte electric also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to customers 

strategy and competition 

dte electrics electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner with potential capacity constraints in the miso region there will be increased dependency on dte electrics generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers this generation will require a large investment in dte electrics aging coal fleet proposed natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility and renewables 

dte electrics distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to customers dte electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

 11 

the electric retail access program in michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total retail access related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on dte electrics financial performance and full service customer rates energy legislation passed in 2016 retained the 10 retail access cap with some revisions dte electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales in 2018  

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers dte electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

gas 

description 

dte energys gas segment consists principally of dte gas a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million  residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity 

operating revenues by service 



 dte gas natural gas sales enduser transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of the business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and dte gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in annual average customer usage are minimized by the rdm 

dte gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte gas

strategy and competition 

dte gas strategy is to ensure the safe reliable and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in michigan in addition dte gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to underserved markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces water heaters and appliances within its current customer base dte gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy efficiency products and services to its customers making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for enduser transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for dte gas enduser transportation service dte gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by its storage capacity 

having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of dte gas storage and transportation services to gas producers marketers distribution companies enduser customers and other pipeline companies the business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

 energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers energy tradings customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies energy trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the mtm method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives energy trading utilizes forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory contracts for pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the business’ strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the cftc us department of homeland security and doe in addition energy trading is subject to applicable laws rules and regulations in canada

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers the following table summarizes dte energys including dte electrics estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations pending or future reconsiderations of current regulations may impact the estimated expenditures summarized in the table below the amounts reported in the table do not include any expenditures related to the epa clean power plan as discussed below actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



water  — the epa finalized regulations on cooling water intake in august 2014 dte electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes 

contaminated and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites dte gas owns or previously owned 14 such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites dte energy anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse effect on dte energys operations dte electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site 

the registrants are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electric distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the registrants financial position and cash flows and the rates charged to their customers 

coal combustion residuals and effluent limitations guidelines — in april 2015 the epa published a final rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals commonly known as coal ash the rule became effective in october 2015 the rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a nonhazardous waste and relies on various selfimplementation design and performance standards dte electric owns and operates 3  permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coalfired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants at certain facilities the rule requires the installation of monitoring wells compliance with groundwater standards and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant at other facilities the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks 

in november 2015 the epa finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which may require additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023 the initial costs to comply with this rule are under development and estimates are included in the coal combustion residual and effluent limitations guidelines amount in the above table 

 19 

on april 12 2017 the epa granted a petition for reconsideration of the elg rule the epa also signed an administrative stay of the elg rule’s compliance deadlines for fly ash transport water bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization fgd wastewater among others on june 6 2017 the epa published in the federal register a proposed rule to postpone certain applicable deadlines within the elg rule the final rule was published on september 18 2017 which extended the earliest compliance deadlines for the fgd wastewater and bottom ash transport until november 1 2020 in order for the epa to propose and finalize a new ruling the elg compliance requirements final deadlines and compliance costs will not be known until the epa completes its reconsideration of the elg rule 

air  — dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide mercury and other emissions these rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures to comply with air pollution requirements through 2024  pending the results of future rulemakings 

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing egus the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on dte electric since dte electric has no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards in february 2016 the us supreme court granted petitioners requests for a stay of the carbon rules for existing egus also known as the epa clean power plan pending final review by the courts the clean power plan has no legal effect while the stay is in place in october 2017 the epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and a notice that it is intending to issue an anpr that may create a replacement rule for the clean power plan it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the epas repeal and potential replacement of the clean power plan on existing sources at this time 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc

employees 

dte energy and its subsidiaries had approximately 10200  employees as of december 31 2017  of which approximately 5000  were represented by unions dte electric had approximately 4700  employees as of december 31 2017  of which approximately 2700  were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for dte energy subsidiaries represented employees the majority of represented employees for both dte energy and dte electric are under contracts that expire in 2020  and 2021  




 item 1a  risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of the registrants utility businesses and dte energys nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the registrants below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses although the registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect performance 

 20 

the registrants are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization the registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies the registrants ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations regulators may also disagree with the registrants rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business if the registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact the registrants ability to recover certain costs through customer rates regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for the registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers the registrants cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how the business operates impact the registrants ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery or require the registrants to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric retail access program could negatively impact the registrants financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for dte electric customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes the registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity 

environmental laws and liability may be costly the registrants are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in the registrants generation fleet and for dte energys gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require the registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals the registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally the registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body the registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

the registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulations of ghg emissions are implemented the operations of dte electrics fossilfueled generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process the registrants financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

for dte energy future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of dte energys gas transportation businesses 

dte energys nonutility businesses may not perform to its expectations  dte energy relies on nonutility operations for an increasing portion of earnings if dte energys current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels dte energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value 

dte energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from the utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

 21 

threats of cyber crime physical security and terrorism could affect the registrants business the registrants may be threatened by issues such as cyber crime physical security or terrorism that may disrupt the registrants operations and could harm the registrants operating results 

cyber crime which includes the use of malware computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies including the registrants has increased in frequency scope and potential impact in recent years the registrants industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber crime physical security threats acts of war or terrorism and other causes if the registrants information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way the registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business operating results and financial condition 

in addition the registrants generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and dte energys gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products the registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the registrants cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the registrants in connection with the registrants businesses they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers shareholders and employees customers shareholders and employees expect that the registrants will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the registrants reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects the registrants to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the registrants to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options while the registrants maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the registrants costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant which may affect the registrants financial performance in addition while the registrants have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning a decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the registrants’ liquidity financial position or results of operations 

construction and capital improvements to the registrants power facilities dte energys distribution systems and its gas storage and pipelines business subject them to risk   the registrants are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at dte electrics multiple power generation and distribution facilities at dte energys gas distribution system and at dte energys gas storage and pipelines business many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the registrants control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals including required certificates from regulatory agencies construction disputes impediments to acquiring rightsofway or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms cost overruns and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the registrants financial performance operations or expected investment returns at the affected facilities businesses and development projects 

 22 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact the registrants financial results the registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity dte energys access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers dte energys nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts dte electric charges utility customers for electricity and dte gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of dte energys nonutility businesses the registrants have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and for dte energy nonutility businesses but there can be no assurances that the registrants financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for dte energys nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact the registrants financial results  the registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of their facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the registrants utility products and for dte energy on the profitability of the nonutility businesses 

emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the registrants  advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include costeffective renewable energy technologies distributed generation energy efficiency technologies and energy storage devices such developments may impact the price of energy may affect energy deliveries as customerowned generation becomes more costeffective may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply andor distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy each of these factors could materially affect the registrants’ results of operations cash flows or financial position 

adverse changes in the registrants credit ratings may negatively affect them regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in the registrants economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in the registrants credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in the registrants credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact their liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the registrants liquidity and results of operations the registrants costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and the registrants required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the registrants plans the registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below the registrants projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the registrants utility customers the results of operations and financial position of the registrants could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets the registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the registrants cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 23 

the registrants ability to access capital markets is important the registrants ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain the registrants ability as well as the ability of their subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the registrants access to capital markets the registrants longterm revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2022  but the registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the registrants utilities and dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

dte energys participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations dte energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed dte energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose dte energy to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks dte energys trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines dte energy sets resulting from the management of dte energys business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish dte energys financial results and financial position dte energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

dte energys ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources dte energy generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery reduced emission fuel renewable energy generation and gas production operations if dte energys production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit or changes in tax law there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact dte energys earnings and cash flows 

weather significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the registrants earnings and cash flows mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the registrants assets lowering income and cash flows at dte electric ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance the registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation the registrants financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect the registrants business the registrants are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy the registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future in addition the registrants expect to comply with new michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

the registrants are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the registrants revenues as customers decrease their energy usage the registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results 

 24 

regional national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the registrants the registrants utility and dte energys nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with should the financial conditions of some of dte energys significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional national or international economic conditions reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services dte energy supplies collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the registrants ’  operations the registrants businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the registrants business and future operating results in addition the registrants have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations 

a work interruption may adversely affect the registrants  there are several bargaining units for dte energys approximately 5000  and dte electrics approximately 2700  represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2020  and 2021  a union choosing to strike would have an impact on the registrants businesses the registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance 

if dte energys goodwill becomes impaired it may be required to record a charge to earnings dte energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of dte energy goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in the industry dte energy cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable dte energy may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact dte energys results of operations and financial position 

the registrants businesses have safety risks the registrants electric distribution system power plants renewable energy equipment and other facilities and dte energys gas distribution system gas infrastructure and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury death or property loss to employees customers or the public although the registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident they could experience financial loss damage to their reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

the registrants may not be fully covered by insurance the registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters war terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the registrants operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or the registrants insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following combined discussion is separately filed by dte energy and dte electric however dte electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to dte energy or the subsidiaries of dte energy other than itself 

 29 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2017  operating revenues of approximately 126 billion  and total assets of approximately 338 billion  dte energy is the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan dte energy operates three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes dte energys financial results 



the increase  in 2017   net income attributable to dte energy company  is primarily due to higher earnings in the gas storage and pipelines energy trading and power and industrial projects segments partially offset by lower earnings in the corporate and other segment the 2017 increase is also due to 105 million of net income tax benefit related to the enactment of the tcja the increase  in 2016   net income attributable to dte energy company  is primarily due to higher earnings in the electric and power and industrial projects segments 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

dte energys utilities are investing capital to improve customer reliability through investments in base infrastructure and new generation and to comply with environmental requirements dte energy expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte energy is focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability dte energy operates in a constructive regulatory environment and has solid relationships with its regulators 

in may 2017 dte energy announced its plan to reduce carbon emissions this goal will be attained by cutting carbon emissions 30 by the early 2020s 45 by 2030 75 by 2040 and more than 80 by 2050 to achieve this reduction dte energy will transition away from coalpowered sources and incorporate more renewable energy energy efficiency demand response and highlyefficient natural gas fueled power plants dte energy has already begun the transition in the way it produces power through the continued retirement of its aging coalfired plants refer to the capital investments section below for further discussion 

dte energy has significant investments in nonutility businesses dte energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets skills and expertise and provides diversity in earnings and geography specifically dte energy invests in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile dte energy expects growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity dte energy has an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

dte energys utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

 30 

dte electrics capital investments over the 20182022  period are estimated at 104 billion  comprised of 41 billion  for capital replacements and other projects 43 billion  for distribution infrastructure and 20 billion  for new generation dte electric has retired four coalfired generation units at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities and has announced plans to retire its remaining thirteen coalfired generating units seven of these coalfired generating units will be retired through 2023 at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities the remaining coalfired generating units at the belle river and monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040 the retired facilities will be replaced with renewables energy efficiency demand response and natural gas fueled generation in september 2016 dte electric received an order from the mpsc in its amended renewable energy plan approving two 150 megawatt wind projects expected to be constructed and in service between 2018 and 2020 and 25 megawatts of companyowned solar projects which will be constructed and in service between 2019 and 2020 dte electric constructed and placed in service 50 megawatts of solar generation in 2017 dte electric plans to build a natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility to provide approximately 1100 megawatts of energy beginning in 2022 in the third quarter of 2017 dte electric filed a con with the mpsc seeking approval for the planned build of this natural gas plant on january 31 2018 dte electric filed its fiveyear distribution operations investment and maintenance plan to improve system reliability with the mpsc dte electric plans to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

dte gas capital investments over the 20182022  period are estimated at 21 billion  comprised of 950 million  for base infrastructure 11 billion  for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs and 10 million  for expenditures related to the nexus pipeline dte gas plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings for base infrastructure capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

dte energys nonutility businesses capital investments are primarily for expansion growth and ongoing maintenance gas storage and pipelines capital investments over the 20182022  period are estimated at 28 billion  to 34 billion  for gathering and pipeline investments and expansions including the nexus pipeline power and industrial projects capital investments over the 20182022  period are estimated at 800 million  to 12 billion  for investments in cogeneration and onsite energy projects 

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially the registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers as authorized by the mpsc 

dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of so 2  and no x  the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce no x  so 2  mercury and other emissions additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for so 2  no x  and other hazardous air pollutants to comply with existing requirements dte electric spent approximately 24 billion  through 2017  dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures through 2024  

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing egus the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on dte electric since dte electric has no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the applicable standards in february 2016 the us supreme court granted petitioners requests for a stay of the carbon rules for existing egus also known as the epa clean power plan pending final review by the courts the clean power plan has no legal effect while the stay is in place on march 28 2017 a presidential executive order was issued on promoting energy independence and economic growth the order instructs the epa to review and if appropriate suspend revise or rescind the clean power plan rule additionally federal agencies have been directed to conduct a review of all existing regulations that potentially burden the development and use of domestically produced energy resources following the issuance of this order the federal government requested the us court of appeals for the dc circuit to hold all legal challenges in abeyance until the review of these regulations is completed on october 10 2017 the epa proposed to rescind the clean power plan and announced its intent to issue an anpr seeking input as to whether it should replace the rule and if so what form it should take it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the epas repeal and possible replacement of the clean power plan on existing sources at this time 

 31 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

increased costs for energy produced from traditional coalbased sources due to recent pending and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable natural gas fueled generation andor nuclear sources energy efficiency initiatives and the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon instruments which could provide new business opportunities for dte energys utility and nonutility segments at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on the registrants or their customers 

see items 1 and 2 business and properties and note 18  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  commitments and contingencies  for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry dte energys strong utility base combined with its integrated nonutility operations position it well for longterm growth 

looking forward dte energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance 

 dte energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as the nongaap financial measures utility margin and nonutility margin discussed below which dte energy uses as measures of its operational performance generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

dte energy uses utility margin and nonutility margin nongaap financial measures to assess its performance by reportable segment 

 32 

utility margin includes electric and gas operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses the utilities’ fuel purchased power and natural gas supply are passed through to customers and therefore result in changes to the utilities’ revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses as such dte energy believes utility margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the utilities’ operations across periods as it excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses 

the nonutility margin relates to our power and industrial projects and energy trading segments for the power and industrial projects segment nonutility margin primarily includes operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses operating revenues include sales of refined coal to third parties and the affiliated electric utility metallurgical coke and related byproducts petroleum coke renewable natural gas and electricity as well as rental income and revenues from utilitytype consulting management and operational services for the energy trading segment nonutility margin includes revenue and realized and unrealized gains and losses from physical and financial power and gas marketing optimization and trading activities net of purchased power and gas related to these activities dte energy evaluates its operating performance of these nonutility businesses using the measure of operating revenues net of fuel purchased power and gas expenses 

utility margin and nonutility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap utility margin and nonutility margin do not intend to represent operating income the most comparable gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of dte energys segments segment information described below includes intercompany revenues and expenses and other income and deductions that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements

 33 

utility margin   decreased   45 million  in 2017  and increased   365 million  in 2016  revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the registrants consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





 

 dte electric sales decreased for residential commercial and industrial primarily due to favorable weather in 2016 

operation and maintenance  expense decreased   27 million  in 2017  and increased   111 million  in 2016  the decrease  in 2017  was primarily due to decreased power plant generation expenses of 66 million partially offset by increased storm restoration expenses of 27 million and increased line clearance expenses of 10 million the decrease in power plant generation expenses includes an increase of 6 million of costs related to the 2016 fire at a generation facility offset by 21 million of insurance proceeds received in 2017   the increase  in 2016  was primarily due to increased power plant generation expenses of 55 million related to outages increased distribution operations expenses of 13 million and 47 million of expenses related to the deferral of negative other postretirement costs pursuant to the order in dte electrics base rate case received in december 2015 the increase in the power plant generation expenses included 19 million of costs related to a fire at a generation facility which were partially reimbursed by insurance proceeds in 2017 

depreciation and amortization  expense increased   3 million  in 2017  and increased   113 million  in 2016  in 2017  the increase  was due to 45 million of increased expense from an increased depreciable base partially offset by a decrease of 29 million associated with the trm and a decrease of 13 million in amortization of regulatory assets in 2016  38 million of the increase  was due to a higher depreciable base 42 million was primarily due to the end of securitization amortization in 2015 and an additional 42 million was associated with the trm offset by a 9 million decrease in nuclear decommissioning amortization 

 34 

other income and deductions   increased   9 million  in 2017  and decreased   9 million  in 2016  the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to higher interest expense of 10 million lower interest income of 8 million related to a sales and use tax settlement received in 2016 and a 7 million contribution to the dte energy foundation partially offset by 12 million of higher investment earnings and a 3 million decrease in low income selfsufficiency plan lsp contributions to notforprofit organizations in 2016 the decrease  in 2016  was primarily due to 13 million of higher investment earnings 8 million of interest income related to a sales and use tax settlement offset by 3 million of lsp contributions to notforprofit organizations 2 million afudc equity and 6 million higher interest expense 

outlook   —  dte electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte electric expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs impact of 2016 michigan energy legislation uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and effects of energy efficiency programs 

dte electric filed a rate case with the mpsc on april 19 2017 requesting an increase in base rates of 231 million  based on a projected twelvemonth period ending october 31 2018 the requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments environmental compliance and reliability improvement projects the rate filing also includes projected changes in sales operation and maintenance expenses and working capital the rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 101  to 105  on september 8 2017 dte electric filed an application with the mpsc for a 125 million  selfimplemented base rate increase effective november 1 2017 a final mpsc order in this case is expected by april 2018 

on january 19 2018 dte electric filed information with the mpsc regarding the potential change in revenue requirements due to the tcja effective january 1 2018 and outlined our recommended method to flow the current and deferred tax benefits of those impacts to ratepayers

the gas segment consists principally of dte gas gas results are discussed below 



utility margin   increased   75 million  in 2017  and increased   20 million  in 2016  revenues associated with certain surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in dte energys consolidated statements of operations 

 35 

the following table details changes in various utility margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





operation and maintenance  expense increased   40 million  in 2017  and decreased   19 million  in 2016  the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to increased employee benefits expenses of 30 million increased corporate expenses of 3 million and increased gas operations expenses of 3 million the decrease  in 2016  was primarily due to decreased uncollectible expenses of 14 million and decreased transmission expenses of 8 million the decreased uncollectible expenses and transmission expenses in 2016 were primarily the result of weatherrelated impacts of warmer weather in 2016 additionally dte gas took actions to reduce costs to partially offset the negative impacts to revenue and utility margin resulting from the warmer weather in 2016 

depreciation and amortization   expense increased   17 million  in 2017  and increased   2 million  in 2016  the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to increased expense from an increased depreciable base and higher depreciation rates 

other income and deductions   increased   12 million  in 2017  and increased   20 million  in 2016  the increase  in 2017  was primarily due to increased contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations of 7 million and higher interest expense of 5 million the increase  in 2016  was primarily due to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations 

outlook —  dte gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustain strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs dte gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability

gas storage and pipelines 

the gas storage and pipelines segment consists of the nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations   increased   151 million  in 2017  and increased   59 million  in 2016  the increase  in both periods was primarily due to the acquisition of ags and sgg in october 2016 and increased volumes on the bluestone pipeline and susquehanna gathering systems 

cost of gas — nonutility   increased   24 million  in 2017  and increased   6 million  in 2016  the increase  in both periods was primarily driven by the physical purchase of gas from ags customers for resale to optimize available transportation capacity 

operation and maintenance   expense increased   2 million  in 2017  and increased   23 million  in 2016  the 2016   increase  was primarily due to the transaction costs related to the acquisition of ags and sgg in 2016 and increased activity on the susquehanna gathering system 

depreciation and amortization  expense increased   31 million  in 2017  and increased   15 million  in 2016  the 2017   increase  was primarily due to the acquisition of ags and sgg in october 2016 the 2016   increase  was due primarily to the acquisition of ags and sgg and additional bluestone and susquehanna expansion projects placed in service 

other income and deductions   decreased   13 million  in 2017  and increased   2 million  in 2016  the 2017   decrease  was primarily due to a 16 million net loss on extinguishment of debt within the storage business and contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations partially offset by increased earnings from pipeline investments the 2016   increase  was primarily due to increased earnings from pipeline investments partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of the acquisition of ags and sgg in 2016 

income tax expense benefit   decreased   101 million  in 2017  from the expense of 71 million  in 2016  and increased   1 million  in 2016  the 2017   decrease  was primarily due to the 115 million remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 this was partially offset by increased tax expense on higher earnings in 2017  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   increased   20 million  in 2017  and increased   5 million  in 2016  the increase  in both periods was primarily due to the acquisition of sgg in october 2016 

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report acquisitions and exit activities for discussion of the acquisition of ags and sgg in october 2016 

outlook —  the bluestone pipeline and susquehanna gathering system are being expanded with additional compression facilities and gathering lines as needed to accommodate shipper demand dte energy believes its longterm agreement with southwestern energy production company and the quality of the natural gas reserves in the marcellus region soundly positions bluestone pipeline and susquehanna gathering system for future growth 

 37 

progress continues on development activities on the nexus pipeline a transportation path to transport appalachian basin shale gas including utica and marcellus shale gas directly to consuming markets in northern ohio southeastern michigan and dawn ontario dte energy owns a 50 partnership interest in the nexus pipeline the ferc application was approved on august 25 2017 and construction commenced in october 2017 dte energy anticipates a third quarter 2018 inservice date for the nexus pipeline 

the october 2016 acquisition of ags and sgg provides a platform for midstream growth and access to further investment opportunities in the appalachian basin an additional connection to the nexus pipeline which should drive incremental volumes on the nexus pipeline and a new set of producer relationships that may lead to more partnering opportunities 

in may 2017 dte energy filed a ferc application for approval of the birdsboro pipeline a 14mile lateral to serve a new power plant in pennsylvania dte energy is targeting a 2018 inservice date 

gas storage and pipelines expects to maintain its steady growth by developing an asset portfolio with multiple growth platforms through investment in new projects and expansions gas storage and pipelines will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other storage and pipeline projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects 

the power and industrial projects segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity from renewable energy projects power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



 38 

operating revenues — nonutility operations   increased   183 million  in 2017  and decreased   318 million  in 2016  the changes are due to the following 



nonutility margin   increased   10 million  in 2017  and decreased   121 million  in 2016  the changes are due to the following 



operation and maintenance  expense increased   23 million  in 2017  and decreased   59 million  in 2016  the 2017   increase  was primarily due to an increase in maintenance spending driven by improved conditions in the steel business of 16 million higher maintenance and a new acquisition in the renewables business of 7 million and an increase associated with new projects in the ref business of 5 million offset by lower spending as a result of the closure of the shenango coke battery in 2015 of 6 million the 2016   decrease  was primarily due to lower spending as a result of the closure of the shenango coke battery in 2015 of 68 million cost control due to lower demand in the steel business and lower spending primarily due to the closure of a renewable power project of 4 million partially offset by an increase associated with new projects in the ref business of 14 million 

asset gains losses and impairments net   decreased  by 21 million  in 2017  from the net gain  of 1 million  in 2016  and decreased  by 107 million  in 2016  from the net loss  of 106 million  in 2015  the 2017   decrease  was primarily due to an impairment in the ref business of 14 million and an impairment of a petroleum coke project of 6 million the 2016   decrease  was primarily due to a loss associated with the closure of the shenango coke battery in 2015 

 39 

other income and deductions   increased   12 million  in 2017  and decreased   6 million  in 2016  the 2017   increase  was primarily due to increased equity earnings in the renewable business of 9 million and insurance settlements in the renewable and ref businesses of 6 million offset by increased contributions to the dte energy foundation of 6 million the 2016   decrease  was primarily due to the reduction of refined coal produced at ref sites with investors of 9 million and lower equity earnings primarily from a renewable power project of 8 million offset by higher contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations in 2015 of 11 million 

income taxes — benefit   increased  by 16 million  in 2017  and decreased  by 23 million  in 2016  the 2017   increase  was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 of 21 million an increase due to higher pretax loss of 7 million and a decrease due to a worthless stock deduction associated with the shenango closure in 2016 of 10 million the decrease  in 2016  was primarily driven by a lower pretax loss of 33 million offset by a 10 million worthless stock deduction due to the shenango closure 

income taxes — production tax credits   increased  by 39 million  in 2017  and increased   23 million  in 2016  the increase  in both periods was primarily due to new projects in the ref business 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests   increased  by 8 million  in 2017  and increased  by 32 million  in 2016  the 2017   increase  is primarily due to a change in the ownership percentage in one of the ref projects of 8 million the 2016   increase  consists of 27 million due to new lease arrangements and 5 million due to existing lease arrangements with investors at various ref facilities 

outlook —  power and industrial projects has constructed and placed in service ref facilities at eleven sites including facilities located at eight thirdparty owned coalfired power plants dte energy has sold membership interests in four of the facilities and entered into lease arrangements in three of the facilities dte energy will continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors or entering into lease arrangements for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and natural gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers energy trading results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations   and   purchased power and gas — nonutility  were impacted by an increase in both volumes and gas prices for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily in the gas structured strategy for 2016  these line items were impacted by an increase in volumes partially offset by a decrease in gas prices primarily in the gas structured strategy 

 40 

nonutility margin   increased   177 million  in 2017  and decreased   19 million  in 2016  the change in both periods was primarily due to timing from the unrealized and realized margins presented in the following tables 



 

 

 

 other income and deductions   decreased   27 million  in 2017  and increased   23 million  in 2016  the change in both periods was primarily due to 2016 contributions to the dte energy foundation 

outlook —  in the nearterm energy trading expects market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of rtos significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result energy trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets energy tradings strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

dte energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities to grow the nonutility businesses to retire and pay interest on longterm debt and to pay dividends dte energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements dte energy expects that cash from operations in 2018  will be approximately 20 billion  dte energy anticipates base level utility capital investments including environmental renewable and energy waste reduction expenditures expenditures for nonutility businesses and contributions to equity method investees in 2018  of approximately 36 billion  dte energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

 42 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of dte energys operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric retail access regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

cash from operations increased   33 million  in 2017  the increase  in operating cash flows reflects an increase in net income and adjustments for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation and amortization and assets gains losses and impairments partially offset by a decrease to deferred income taxes and working capital adjustments 

cash from operations increased   168 million  in 2016  the increase  in operating cash flows reflects an increase in net income and adjustments for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation and amortization partially offset by decreases from asset gains losses and impairments net and working capital items 

the change in working capital items in 2017  primarily related to increases of cash used for accounts receivable inventories accrued pension liability derivative assets and liabilities equity earnings of equity method investees and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities partially offset by increases in cash from the accrued postretirement liability and regulatory assets and liabilities the change in working capital items in 2016  primarily related to increases in cash used for accounts receivable and regulatory assets and liabilities partially offset by increases in cash from accounts payable accrued pension liability and accrued postretirement liability 

 43 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures in any given year dte energy looks to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within the nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth dte energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis dte energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria for new business lines dte energy initially invests based on research and analysis dte energy starts with a limited investment evaluates the results and either expands or exits the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of dte energy with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings 

net cash used for  investing activities decreased   824 million  in 2017  due primarily to dte energys 2016 acquisition of midstream natural gas assets partially offset by increased capital expenditures contributions to equity method investees primarily the nexus pipeline as it continues to develop and two acquisitions of landfill gas facilities which are presented in investing activities  other 

net cash used for  investing activities increased   12 billion  in 2016  due primarily to dte energys acquisition of midstream natural gas assets net of cash acquired of 83 million  of 11 billion  as described in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  acquisitions and exit activities  as well as increased contributions to equity method investees primarily the nexus pipeline as it continues to develop 

cash from financing activities 

dte energy relies on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations 

dte energys strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity dte energy continually evaluates its leverage target which is currently 50 to 54 to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from  financing activities decreased   938 million  in 2017  the decrease  is primarily attributable to a decrease in issuances of longterm debt and equity units contributions from noncontrolling interests an increase in dividends on common stock and distributions to noncontrolling interests partially offset by an increase to shortterm borrowings and a decrease to redemptions and repurchases of longterm debt 

net cash from  financing activities increased   11 billion  in 2016  the increase  is primarily attributable to increases in issuances of longterm debt and equity units which are partially offset by increased redemptions of longterm debt and a decrease in shortterm borrowings the increased issuances in 2016  were primarily related to the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets see details in the acquisition financing section of note 14  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  longterm debt  

outlook 

dte energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from the utility and nonutility businesses growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

dte energy may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future dte energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of longterm capital projects 

 44 

dte energy has approximately 110 million  in longterm debt including capital leases maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 14 billion  of available liquidity at december 31 2017  consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

dte energy expects to issue equity up to 300 million  in 2018  through the dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans 

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy may make contributions up to 200 million  including contributions from dte electric of 175 million  to its pension plans in 2018  dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2018  

various subsidiaries and equity investees of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as hard triggers state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as soft triggers are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2017  dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was approximately 456 million  

dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of dte energys businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows

contractual obligations 

the following table details dte energys including dte electrics contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2017  



 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the registrants consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements the registrants management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of the registrants businesses are subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses the registrants management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  

derivatives 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2017  and 2016  the registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values the registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the registrants estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices the registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts see the sensitivity analysis in item 7a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 12 and 13  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of dte energys reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations dte energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

 47 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test dte energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test dte energy estimates the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance dte energy also employs marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

dte energy performs an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests dte energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while dte energy believes the assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact dte energys earnings 

dte energy performed its annual impairment test as of october 1 2017  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed as part of the annual impairment test dte energy also compared the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to its overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity 

the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the october 1 2017  valuation date 



 

 longlived assets 

the registrants evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require the registrants to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact their earnings 

 48 

pension and other postretirement costs 

dte energy sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the registrants the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required dte energy considers historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

dte energy had pension costs of 172 million  in 2017  167 million  in 2016  and 221 million  in 2015  other postretirement benefit credits were 31 million  in 2017  111 million  in 2016  and 99 million  in 2015  pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for 2017  were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 750  for the pension plans and 775  for the other postretirement benefit plans in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumptions dte energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets dte energys 2018  expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 40  in equity markets 32  in fixed income markets including long duration bonds and 28  invested in other assets dte energys 2018  expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 40  in equity markets 26  in fixed income markets and 34  invested in other assets because of market volatility dte energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions and financial market risk considerations dte energy is maintaining its longterm rate of return assumptions for the pension plans and other post retirement plans at 750  and 775  respectively for 2018  dte energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rate of return on the plan assets for 2018  given its investment strategy dte energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions including its expected rate of return at least annually 

dte energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for the pension plans dte energy uses a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized positive asset performance in 2017  resulted in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2017  dte energy had 223 million  of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets related to investment performance in 2017  and 2016  for the other postretirement benefit plans dte energy uses fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that dte energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans the discount rate determined on this basis was 370  for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2017  compared to 425  for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2016  

dte energy changed the mortality assumption as of december 31 2017  to reflect the updated mp2017 projection scale along with the actual experience and credibility of each population the mortality assumptions used at december 31 2017  are the rp2014 mortality table projected back to 2006 using scale mp2014 and projected forward using scale mp2017 with generational projection the base mortality tables vary by type of plan employees union status and employment status with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population 

 49 

dte energy estimates the 2018  total pension costs will be approximately 150 million  in 2018  compared to 172 million  in 2017 the reduction in total pension costs is primarily due to updated demographic assumptions and positive asset performance offset by a lower discount rate the 2018  other postretirement benefit credit will be approximately 30 million  compared to 31 million  in 2017  

the health care trend rates for dte energy assume 675  for pre65 participants and 725  for post65 participants for 2018  trending down to 450  for both pre65 and post65 participants in 2030 

future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2017  pension costs by approximately 42 million  lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2017  pension costs by approximately 38 million  lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2017  other postretirement credit by approximately 18 million  lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have decreased the 2017  other postretirement credit by approximately 26 million  lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the other postretirement credit for 2017  by approximately 5 million  

the value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 65 billion  at december 31 2017  and 58 billion  at december 31 2016  at december 31 2017  dte energys qualified pension plans were underfunded by 807 million  and its other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 62 million  the 2017  funding levels improved as positive asset performance and plan sponsor contributions offset a decrease in discount rates 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets dte energy made contributions to its qualified pension plans of 223 million  in 2017  and 179 million  in 2016  at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to 200 million  in 2018  and up to 415 million  over the next five years dte energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2017  and made contributions of 20 million  in 2016  dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement plans in 2018  or over the next five years the planned pension contributions will be made in cash andor dte energy common stock

legal reserves 

the registrants are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon the registrants management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the registrants 

accounting for tax obligations 

the registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold the registrants also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

 50 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the consolidated financial statements the registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2017  and 2016  are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the registrants consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts dte energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power natural gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items dte energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation contracts renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 12 and 13  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in the registrants reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the registrants manage their mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

the electric and gas businesses have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of coal natural gas uranium and electricity however the registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales and transportation services revenue at the gas segment the gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the registrants are exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

dte energys gas storage and pipelines segment has exposure to natural gas price fluctuations which impact the pricing for natural gas storage gathering and transportation dte energy manages its exposure through the use of short medium and longterm storage gathering and transportation contracts 

dte energys power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity natural gas and coal product price risk dte energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of longterm contracts 

dte energys energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas coal crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

the registrants regularly review contingent matters relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts the registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss 

trading activities 

dte energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations dte energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties 

 52 

the following table displays the credit quality of dte energys trading counterparties as of december 31 2017  



 

 other 

the registrants engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade the registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt in order to manage interest costs dte energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements dte energys exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and libor as of december 31 2017  dte energy had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately 48  

foreign currency exchange risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit dte energys exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations dte energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through june 2022  

summary of sensitivity analyses 

the registrants performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values of commodity contracts and longterm debt obligations the commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at december 31 2017  and 2016  by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values

weather economic factors competition energy efficiency initiatives and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers dte electrics peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands dte electrics operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte electric 

fuel supply and purchased power 

dte electrics power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power dte electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers dte electrics generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms dte electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases dte electric has longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 280 million tons of lowsulfur western coal and approximately 23 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2017 to 2021 all of these contracts have pricing schedules dte electric has approximately 90 of the expected coal requirements for 2017 under contract given the geographic diversity of supply dte electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements dte electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western and eastern coal rail requirements under contract through 2021 contracts covering expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities are under contract through 2019 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso dte electric offers its generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load dte electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages

there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between dte electric and electricity providers external to the dte electric service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission an unrelated company and connect to neighboring energy companies 

regulation 

dte electric is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte electrics mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on investments the ferc regulates dte electric with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of dte electrics nuclear plant operations dte electric is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 8 9 12 and 18  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  asset retirement obligations   regulatory matters   fair value  and  commitments and contingencies  

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance that qualifying customers receive dte electric works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte electric also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to customers 

strategy and competition 

dte electrics electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner with potential capacity constraints in the miso region there will be increased dependency on dte electrics generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers this generation will require a large investment due to dte electrics aging coal fleet along with increased environmental regulations 

dte electrics distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to customers dte electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

 9 

the electric retail access program in michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total retail access related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on dte electrics financial performance and full service customer rates energy legislation passed in 2016 retained the 10 retail access cap with some revisions as discussed in energy legislation in item 7 of this report dte electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales in 2017  

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers dte electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

gas 

description 

dte energys gas segment consists principally of dte gas a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million  residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity 

operating revenues by service 



 dte gas natural gas sales enduser transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of the business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and dte gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in average customer usage are minimized by the rdm 

dte gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte gas 

 10 

natural gas supply 

dte gas gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 25 bcf with approximately 67 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2016  peakuse requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity dte gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements dte gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

dte gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify dte gas natural gas supply base natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpscapproved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2019 

dte gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions the primary longterm transportation supply contracts at december 31 2016  are as follows 



properties 

dte gas owns distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan the distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1149000 service pipelines and approximately 1297000 active meters and dte gas owns approximately 2000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect dte gas storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

dte gas owns storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 139 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to dte gas customers in addition dte gas sells storage services to third parties 

most of dte gas distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by dte gas through easements permits or licenses substantially all of dte gas property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

dte gas leases a portion of its pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 17  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report  capital and operating leases  

regulation 

dte gas is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte gas mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on investments dte gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to a mpscapproved tariff 

dte gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the fercs jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by dte gas in interstate markets ferc granted dte gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates dte gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc

dte gas is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 9 and 18  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  and  commitments and contingencies  

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte gas ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte gas uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive dte gas works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the gas service territory dte gas also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to dte gas customers 

strategy and competition 

dte gas strategy is to ensure the safe reliable and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in michigan in addition dte gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to under served markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces water heaters and appliances within its current customer base dte gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy efficiency products and services to its customers making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for enduser transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for dte gas enduser transportation service dte gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by its storage capacity 

having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of dte gas storage and transportation services to gas producers marketers distribution companies enduser customers and other pipeline companies the business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

 energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers energy tradings customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies energy trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the mtm method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives energy trading utilizes forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory contracts for pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the business’ strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the cftc us department of homeland security and doe in addition energy trading is subject to applicable laws rules and regulations in canada

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers the following table summarizes dte energys including dte electrics estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations the amounts reported in the following table do not include any expenditures related to the epa clean power plan as discussed below actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



water  — the epa finalized regulations on cooling water intake in august 2014 dte electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes 

contaminated and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites dte gas owns or previously owned 14 such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites dte energy anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse effect on dte energys operations dte electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site 

the registrants are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electric distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the registrants financial position and cash flows and the rates charged to their customers 

coal combustion residuals and effluent limitations guidelines — in april 2015 the epa published a final rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals commonly known as coal ash the rule became effective in october 2015 the rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a nonhazardous waste and relies on various selfimplementation design and performance standards dte electric owns and operates 3  permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coalfired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants at certain facilities the rule requires the installation of monitoring wells compliance with groundwater standards and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant at other facilities the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks 

in november 2015 the epa finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which may require additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023 the initial costs to comply with this rule are under development and estimates are included in the coal combustion residual and effluent limitations guidelines amount in the above table 

 17 

air  — dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide mercury and other emissions these rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures to comply with air pollution requirements through 2023  pending the results of future rulemakings 

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing egus the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on dte electric since dte electric has no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards in february 2016 the us supreme court granted petitioners requests for a stay of the carbon rules for existing egus also known as the epa clean power plan pending final review by the courts the clean power plan has no legal effect while the stay is in place it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the epa clean power plan on existing sources at this time 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

see management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report and notes 8  9  and 18  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  asset retirement obligations   regulatory matters  and  commitments and contingencies  

employees 

dte energy had approximately 10000  employees as of december 31 2016  of which approximately 4800  were represented by unions dte electric had approximately 4600  employees as of december 31 2016  of which approximately 2600  were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for dte energy’s represented employees the majority of represented employees for both dte energy and dte electric are under contracts that expire in 2017  and 2020  




 item 1a  risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of the registrants utility businesses and dte energys nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the registrants below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses although the registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect performance 

the registrants are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization the registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies the registrants ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations regulators may also disagree with the registrants rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business if the registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact the registrants ability to recover certain costs through customer rates regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for the registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers the registrants cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how the business operates impact the registrants ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery or require the registrants to incur additional expenses 

 18 

changes to michigans electric retail access program could negatively impact the registrants financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for dte electric customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes the registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity 

the miso regional energy market including the state of michigan is expected to face capacity constraints due primarily to the retirement of coalfired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements significant investment in new natural gasfired generation and renewables will be required 

environmental laws and liability may be costly the registrants are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in the registrants generation fleet and for dte energy gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require the registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals the registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally the registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body the registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

the registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulations of ghg emissions are implemented the operations of dte electrics fossilfueled generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process the registrants financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

for dte energy future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of dte energys gas transportation businesses 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects the registrants to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the registrants to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options while the registrants maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the registrants costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant which may affect the registrants financial performance in addition while the registrants have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact the registrants financial results the registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity dte energys access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers dte energys nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts dte electric charges utility customers for electricity and dte gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of dte energys nonutility businesses the registrants have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and for dte energy nonutility businesses but there can be no assurances that the registrants financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for dte energys nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

 19 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact the registrants financial results  the registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of their facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the registrants utility products and for dte energy on the profitability of the nonutility businesses 

adverse changes in the registrants credit ratings may negatively affect them regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in the registrants economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in the registrants credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in the registrants credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact their liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the registrants liquidity and results of operations the registrants costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and the registrants required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the registrants plans the registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below the registrants projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the registrants utility customers the results of operations and financial position of the registrants could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets the registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the registrants cash flows financial position or results of operations 

the registrants ability to access capital markets is important the registrants ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain the registrants ability as well as the ability of their subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the registrants access to capital markets the registrants longterm revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2021 but the registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the registrants utilities and dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

construction and capital improvements to the registrants power facilities dte energys distribution systems and its gas storage and pipelines business subject them to risk   the registrants are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at dte electrics multiple power generation and distribution facilities at dte energys gas distribution system and at dte energys gas storage and pipelines business many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the registrants control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals including required certificates from regulatory agencies construction disputes impediments to acquiring rightsofway or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms cost overruns and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the registrants financial performance operations or expected investment returns at the affected facilities businesses and development projects 

dte energys nonutility businesses may not perform to its expectations  dte energy relies on nonutility operations for an increasing portion of earnings if dte energys current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels dte energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value 

 20 

dte energys participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations dte energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed dte energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose dte energy to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks dte energys trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines dte energy sets resulting from the management of dte energys business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish dte energys financial results and financial position dte energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

dte energys ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources dte energy generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery reduced emission fuel renewable energy generation and gas production operations if dte energys production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact dte energys earnings and cash flows 

weather significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the registrants earnings and cash flows mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the registrants assets lowering income and cash flows at dte electric ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance the registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation the registrants financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs 

dte energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from the utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect the registrants business the registrants are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy the registrants have complied with the existing state legislation but do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation in addition the registrants expect to comply with new michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

the registrants are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the registrants revenues as customers decrease their energy usage the registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results 

regional national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the registrants the registrants utility and dte energys nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with should the financial conditions of some of dte energys significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional national or international economic conditions reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services dte energy supplies collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows 

 21 

threats of cyber crime and terrorism could affect the registrants business the registrants may be threatened by issues such as cyber crime or terrorism that may disrupt the registrants operations and could harm the registrants operating results 

cyber crime which includes the use of malware computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies including the registrants has increased in frequency scope and potential impact in recent years the registrants industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber crime acts of war or terrorism and other causes if the registrants information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way the registrants might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business operating results and financial condition 

in addition the registrants generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and for dte energy gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products the registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that the registrants cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the registrants in connection with the registrants businesses they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers shareholders and employees customers shareholders and employees expect that the registrants will adequately protect their personal information and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the registrants reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

failure to successfully implement new processes and information systems could interrupt the registrants ’  operations registrants businesses depend on numerous information systems for operations financial information and billings the registrants are in the midst of an initiative to replace its customer billing systems in the second quarter of 2017 failure to successfully implement this initiative could affect the registrants ability to timely and accurately bill and collect from its customers which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants’ business operating results and financial condition 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the registrants ’  operations the registrants businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the registrants business and future operating results in addition the registrants have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations 

a work interruption may adversely affect the registrants  there are several bargaining units for dte energys approximately 4800  and dte electrics approximately 2600  represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2017  and 2020  a union choosing to strike would have an impact on the registrants businesses the registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance 

if dte energys goodwill becomes impaired it may be required to record a charge to earnings dte energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of dte energy goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in the industry dte energy cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable dte energy may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact dte energys results of operations and financial position 

the registrants businesses have safety risks the registrants electric distribution system power plants renewable energy equipment and other facilities and dte energys gas distribution system gas infrastructure and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury death or property loss to employees customers or the public although the registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident they could experience financial loss damage to their reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

 22 

the registrants may not be fully covered by insurance the registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the registrants operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or the registrants insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

the allowance for doubtful accounts for dte electric and dte gas is generally calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies dte electric and dte gas establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and management’s assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the due date which is typically in 21  days however factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action dte electric and dte gas assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on pastdue terms with customers customer accounts are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted the time period for writeoff is 150  days after service has been terminated 

the customer allowance for doubtful accounts for dte energys other businesses is calculated based on specific review of probable future collections based on receivable balances generally in excess of 30 days 

dte energy unbilled revenues of 814 million  and 620 million  including 267 million  and 237 million  of dte electric unbilled revenues are included in customer accounts receivable at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

notes receivable 

notes receivable or financing receivables for dte energy are primarily comprised of capital lease receivables and loans and are included in notes receivable and other current assets on dte energy’s consolidated statements of financial position notes receivable or financing receivables for dte electric are primarily comprised of loans 

notes receivable are typically considered delinquent when payment is not received for periods ranging from 60  to 120  days the registrants cease accruing interest nonaccrual status consider a note receivable impaired and establish an allowance for credit loss when it is probable that all principal and interest amounts due will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the note receivable cash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable that do not bring the account contractually current are first applied to contractually owed past due interest with any remainder applied to principal accrual of interest is generally resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current 

in determining the allowance for credit losses for notes receivable the registrants consider the historical payment experience and other factors that are expected to have a specific impact on the counterparty’s ability to pay in addition the registrants monitor the credit ratings of the counterparties from which they have notes receivable 

inventories 

inventory related to utility operations is generally valued at average cost inventory related to nonutility operations is valued at the lower of cost or market 

dte gas natural gas inventory of 45 million  and 65 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively is determined using the lastin firstout lifo method the replacement cost of gas in inventory exceeded the lifo cost by 132 million  and 60 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

property retirement and maintenance and depreciation and amortization 

property is stated at cost and includes constructionrelated labor materials overheads and afudc for utility property the cost of utility properties retired is charged to accumulated depreciation expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred except for fermi 2 

utility property at dte electric and dte gas is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straightline rates approved by the mpsc 

dte energys nonutility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using the straightline method 

depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of certain regulatory assets for the registrants 

approximately 27 million  and 4 million  of expenses related to fermi 2 refueling outages were accrued at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively amounts are accrued on a prorata basis generally over an 18 month period that coincides with scheduled refueling outages at fermi 2 this accrual of outage costs matches the regulatory recovery of these costs in rates set by the mpsc see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  

the cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized the amortization of nuclear fuel is included within fuel purchased power and gas —  utility in the dte energy consolidated statements of operations and fuel and purchased power in the dte electric consolidated statements of operations and is recorded using the unitsofproduction method

longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected discounted future cash flows generated by the asset an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

intangible assets 

the registrants have certain intangible assets as shown below 



 

 the following table summarizes dte energys estimated customer relationship and contract intangible amortization expense expected to be recognized during each year through 2021  



dte energy amortizes customer relationship and contract intangible assets on a straightline basis over the expected period of benefit dte energys intangible assets amortization expense was 16 million  in 2016  11 million  in 2015  and 12 million  in 2014  

excise and sales taxes 

the registrants record the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing authority with no  net impact on the registrants’ consolidated statements of operations

deferred debt costs 

the costs related to the issuance of longterm debt are deferred and amortized over the life of each debt issue the deferred amounts are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of each debt issue in mortgage bonds notes and other and junior subordinated debentures on dte energys consolidated statements of financial position and in mortgage bonds notes and other on dte electrics consolidated statements of financial position in accordance with mpsc regulations applicable to dte energy’s electric and gas utilities the unamortized discount premium and expense related to utility debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue discount premium and expense on early redemptions of debt associated with dte energys nonutility operations are charged to earnings 

investments in debt and equity securities 

the registrants generally classify investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or availableforsale and have recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains or losses included in earnings or in other comprehensive income or loss respectively changes in the fair value of fermi 2 nuclear decommissioning investments are recorded as adjustments to regulatory assets or liabilities due to a recovery mechanism from customers the registrants equity investments are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if the assessment indicates that the impairment is other than temporary a loss is recognized resulting in the equity investment being written down to its estimated fair value see note 12  of the consolidated financial statements  fair value  

government grants 

grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that any conditions associated with the grant will be met when grants are received related to property plant and equipment the registrants reduce the cost of the assets on their consolidated statements of financial position resulting in lower depreciation expense over the life of the associated asset grants received related to expenses are reflected as a reduction of the associated expense in the period in which the expense is incurred 

dte energy foundation 

dte energys charitable contributions to the dte energy foundation were 26 million  12 million  and 25 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the dte energy foundation is a nonconsolidated notforprofit private foundation the purpose of which is to contribute to and assist charitable organizations

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  this asu requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts this asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods therein it is to be applied retrospectively the registrants adopted this asu at january 1 2016 the implementation of this guidance is reflected in note 14  of the consolidated financial statements  longterm debt  the effect of the adoption decreased assets and liabilities on dte energys and dte electrics consolidated statements of financial position by 75 million  and 36 million  respectively at december 31 2015 

in may 2015 the fasb issued asu 201507  fair value measurement topic 820 disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent this guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share or its equivalent practical expedient the guidance applies to investments for which there is not a readily determinable fair value market quote or the investment is in a mutual fund without a publicly available net asset value it is effective for the registrants for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 it is to be applied retrospectively the registrants adopted this asu at january 1 2016 the implementation of this guidance is reflected in notes 12 and 20  to the consolidated financial statements  fair value  and  retirement benefits and trusteed assets  respectively this implementation did not have a significant impact on the registrants consolidated financial statements 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 compensation   — stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting   the asu simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the consolidated statements of cash flows under the new standard income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be recognized in the income statement and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur this provision is to be applied prospectively excess tax benefits should be recognized regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period along with any valuation allowance on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the retained earnings as of the date of adoption excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity this provision can be applied prospectively or retrospectively for all periods presented the standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods therein effective july 1 2016 dte energy elected to early adopt this standard as permitted as a result of the adoption dte energy recognized 1 million  of excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis dte energy also recognized a 3 million  cumulativeeffect adjustment to increase retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach while there was no impact to the current period cash flows related to the excess tax benefits on dte energys consolidated statements of cash flows will be classified as operating activities on a prospective basis due to the prospective election prior period amounts have not been adjusted in addition cash paid on the employees’ behalf related to restricted shares withheld for tax purposes have been classified as a financing activity on a retrospective basis for the year ended december 31 2016  the implementation resulted in an increase to net cash from operating activities with a corresponding decrease to net cash from financing activities of 4 million  this retrospective application resulted in an increase to net cash from operating activities with a corresponding decrease to net cash from financing activities of 5 million  and 6 million  for the years ended   december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively finally dte energys stock compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures

note 8  — asset retirement obligations 

dte electric has a legal retirement obligation for the decommissioning costs for its fermi 1 and fermi 2 nuclear plants dismantlement of facilities located on leased property and various other operations dte electric has conditional retirement obligations for asbestos and pcb removal at certain of its power plants and various distribution equipment dte gas has conditional retirement obligations for gas pipelines certain service centers compressor and gate stations the registrants recognize such obligations as liabilities at fair market value when they are incurred which generally is at the time the associated assets are placed in service fair value is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the registrants creditadjusted riskfree rate for its utility operations the registrants recognize in the consolidated statements of operations removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment any differences between costs recognized related to asset retirement and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated statements of financial position

dte energy company — dte electric company 

combined notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 

if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred such as for assets with indeterminate lives the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made natural gas storage system and certain other distribution assets for dte gas and substations manholes and certain other distribution assets for dte electric have an indeterminate life therefore no liability has been recorded for these assets 

a reconciliation of the asset retirement obligations for 2016  follows 



 

 approximately 18 billion  of the asset retirement obligations represent nuclear decommissioning liabilities that are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the life of the fermi 2 nuclear plant the nrc has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires minimum decommissioning funding based upon a formula the mpsc and ferc regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of fermi 2 rates approved by the mpsc provide for the recovery of decommissioning costs of fermi 2 and the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste dte electric believes the mpsc collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning the decommissioning assets anticipated earnings thereon and future revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to decommission fermi 2 dte electric expects the liabilities to be reduced to zero  at the conclusion of the decommissioning activities if amounts remain in the trust funds for fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning activities those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by the mpsc and ferc 

a portion of the funds recovered through the fermi 2 decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust accounts is designated for the removal of nonradioactive assets and returning the site to greenfield this removal and greenfielding is not considered a legal liability therefore it is not included in the asset retirement obligation but is reflected as the nuclear decommissioning liability the decommissioning of fermi 1 is funded by dte electric contributions to the fermi 1 trust are discretionary for additional discussion of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements  fair value

regulatory assets and liabilities 

dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and collected from customers future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses and may require the writeoff of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment 

the following are balances and a brief description of the registrants regulatory assets and liabilities at december 31

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2016  and 2015  the registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs

a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 in some cases the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy all assets and liabilities are required to be classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy the registrants classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined as follows

 cash equivalents 

cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased the cash equivalents shown in the fair value table are comprised of shortterm investments and money market funds 

nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments 

the nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through institutional mutual funds and commingled funds exchangetraded debt and equity securities held directly are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded markets nonexchangetraded fixed income securities are valued based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services the institutional mutual funds hold exchangetraded equity or debt securities exchange and nonexchange traded and are valued based on publicly available navs the commingled funds hold exchangetraded equity or debt securities exchange and nonexchange traded and are valued based on a calculated nav as a practical expedient a primary price source is identified by asset type class or issue for each security the trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the trustee determines that another price source is considered to be preferable the registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices additionally the registrants selectively corroborate the fair value of securities by comparison of marketbased price sources investment policies and procedures are determined by dte energys trust investments department which reports to dte energys vice president and treasurer

derivative assets and liabilities 

derivative assets and liabilities are comprised of physical and financial derivative contracts including futures forwards options and swaps that are both exchangetraded and overthecounter traded contracts various inputs are used to value derivatives depending on the type of contract and availability of market data exchangetraded derivative contracts are valued using quoted prices in active markets the registrants consider the following criteria in determining whether a market is considered active frequency in which pricing information is updated variability in pricing between sources or over time and the availability of public information other derivative contracts are valued based upon a variety of inputs including commodity market prices broker quotes interest rates credit ratings default rates marketbased seasonality and basis differential factors the registrants monitor the prices that are supplied by brokers and pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of an index if prices become unavailable or another price source is determined to be more representative of fair value the registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived additionally the registrants selectively corroborate the fair value of their transactions by comparison of marketbased price sources mathematical valuation models are used for derivatives for which external market data is not readily observable such as contracts which extend beyond the actively traded reporting period the registrants have established a risk management committee whose responsibilities include directly or indirectly ensuring all valuation methods are applied in accordance with predefined policies the development and maintenance of the registrants forward price curves has been assigned to dte energys risk management department which is separate and distinct from the trading functions within dte energy

the following table presents the fair value reconciliation of level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for dte electric for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  



derivatives are transferred between levels primarily due to changes in the source data used to construct price curves as a result of changes in market liquidity transfers in and transfers out are reflected as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period 

there were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 for the registrants during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  and there were no transfers from or into level 3 for dte electric during the same periods 

the following tables present the unobservable inputs related to dte energys level 3 assets and liabilities as of december 31 2016  and 2015  





the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the electricity and natural gas commodity types consist of inputs that are less observable due in part to lack of available broker quotes supported by little if any market activity at the measurement date or are based on internally developed models certain basis prices ie the difference in pricing between two locations included in the valuation of natural gas and electricity contracts were deemed unobservable 

the inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above security types if they were adjusted a significant increase decrease in the basis price would result in a higher lower fair value for long positions with offsetting impacts to short positions

fair value of financial instruments 

the fair value of financial instruments included in the table below is determined by using quoted market prices when available when quoted prices are not available pricing services may be used to determine the fair value with reference to observable interest rate indexes the registrants have obtained an understanding of how the fair values are derived the registrants also selectively corroborate the fair value of their transactions by comparison of marketbased price sources discounted cash flow analyses based upon estimated current borrowing rates are also used to determine fair value when quoted market prices are not available the fair values of notes receivable excluding capital leases and notes payable are generally estimated using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining life of the loans and credit risk depending on the information available other valuation techniques may be used that rely on internal assumptions and models valuation policies and procedures for the registrants are determined by dte energys treasury department which reports to dte energys vice president and treasurer and dte energys controllers department which reports to dte energys vice president and controller

the following table summarizes dte electrics fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets 



the costs of securities sold are determined on the basis of specific identification the following table sets forth dte electrics gains and losses and proceeds from the sale of securities by the nuclear decommissioning trust funds 



realized gains and losses from the sale of securities for fermi 2 are recorded to the regulatory asset and nuclear decommissioning liability realized gains and losses from the sale of securities for lowlevel radioactive waste funds are recorded to the nuclear decommissioning liability 

the following table sets forth dte electrics fair value and unrealized gains and losses for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds 



the debt securities at december 31 2016  and 2015  had an average maturity of approximately 7 years  and 6 years  respectively securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are classified as availableforsale as dte electric does not have the ability to hold impaired investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery of market value all unrealized losses are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments 

unrealized losses incurred by the fermi 2 trust are recognized as a regulatory asset and nuclear decommissioning liability unrealized losses on the lowlevel radioactive waste funds are recognized as a nuclear decommissioning liability 

other securities 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  the registrants securities were comprised primarily of money market and equity securities there were no  unrealized losses on availableforsale securities which were reclassified out of other comprehensive income loss and realized into net income for dte energy or dte electric during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  gains related to trading securities held at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were 15 million  1 million  and 14 million  respectively for the registrants the trading gains or losses related to the rabbi trust assets included in other investments at dte energy are allocated from dte energy to dte electric

note 13  — financial and other derivative instruments 

the registrants recognize all derivatives at their fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on their respective consolidated statements of financial position unless they qualify for certain scope exceptions including the normal purchases and normal sales exception further derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge or as hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge for cash flow hedges the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the value of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs gains or losses from the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately for fair value hedges changes in fair values for the derivative and hedged item are recognized in earnings each period for derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period 

the registrants primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices credit and interest rates the registrants have risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks the registrants use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure dte energy uses derivative instruments for trading purposes in its energy trading segment contracts classified as derivative instruments include electricity natural gas oil certain coal forwards futures options swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items not classified as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation contracts renewable energy credits and natural gas storage assets 

dte electric  — dte electric generates purchases distributes and sells electricity dte electric uses forward energy contracts to manage changes in the price of electricity and fuel substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method other derivative contracts are mtm and recoverable through the pscr mechanism when settled this results in the deferral of unrealized gains and losses as regulatory assets or liabilities until realized 

dte gas — dte gas purchases stores transports distributes and sells natural gas and sells storage and transportation capacity dte gas has fixedpriced contracts for portions of its expected natural gas supply requirements through march 2019 substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method dte gas may also sell forward transportation and storage capacity contracts forward transportation and storage contracts are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method 

gas storage and pipelines —  this segment is primarily engaged in services related to the gathering transportation and storage of natural gas primarily fixedpriced contracts are used in the marketing and management of transportation and storage services generally these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method 

power and industrial projects  — this segment manages and operates energy and pulverized coal projects a coke battery reduced emissions fuel projects landfill gas recovery and power generation assets primarily fixedprice contracts are used in the marketing and management of the segment assets these contracts are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method 

energy trading — commodity price risk —  energy trading markets and trades electricity natural gas physical products and energy financial instruments and provides energy and asset management services utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments forwards futures options and swap agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations in its operations these derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met 

energy trading — foreign currency exchange risk —  energy trading has foreign currency exchange forward contracts to economically hedge fixed canadian dollar commitments existing under natural gas and power purchase and sale contracts and natural gas transportation contracts energy trading enters into these contracts to mitigate price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar these derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met 

corporate and other — interest rate risk —  dte energy may use interest rate swaps treasury locks and other derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rate market volatility

credit risk —  dte energy maintains credit policies that significantly minimize overall credit risk these policies include an evaluation of potential customers’ and counterparties’ financial condition including the viability of underlying productive assets credit rating collateral requirements or other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees dte energy generally uses standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty dte energy maintains a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers historical trends and other information based on dte energys credit policies and its december 31 2016  provision for credit losses dte energy’s exposure to counterparty nonperformance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on dte energys consolidated financial statements 

derivative activities 

dte energy manages its mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year the following describes the categories of activities represented by their operating characteristics and key risks

the following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments as of december 31 2016  and 2015  for dte electric 



certain of dte energys derivative positions are subject to netting arrangements which provide for offsetting of asset and liability positions as well as related cash collateral such netting arrangements generally do not have restrictions under such netting arrangements dte energy offsets the fair value of derivative instruments with cash collateral received or paid for those contracts executed with the same counterparty which reduces dte energys total assets and liabilities cash collateral is allocated between the fair value of derivative instruments and customer accounts receivable and payable with the same counterparty on a prorata basis to the extent there is exposure any cash collateral remaining after the exposure is netted to zero is reflected in accounts receivable and accounts payable as collateral paid or received respectively 

dte energy also provides and receives collateral in the form of letters of credit which can be offset against net derivative assets and liabilities as well as accounts receivable and payable dte energy had issued letters of credit of approximately 2 million  and 7 million  outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively which could be used to offset net derivative liabilities letters of credit received from third parties which could be used to offset net derivative assets were 2 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  such balances of letters of credit are excluded from the tables below and are not netted with the recognized assets and liabilities in dte energys consolidated statements of financial position 

for contracts with certain clearing agents the fair value of derivative instruments is netted against realized positions with the net balance reflected as either 1 a derivative asset or liability or 2 an account receivable or payable other than certain clearing agents accounts receivable and accounts payable that are subject to netting arrangements have not been offset against the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities certain contracts that have netting arrangements have not been offset in dte energys consolidated statements of financial position the impact of netting these derivative instruments and cash collateral related to such contracts is not material only the gross amounts for these derivative instruments are included in the table below 

for dte energy the total cash collateral posted net of cash collateral received was 34 million  and 37 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively dte energy had 7 million  of cash collateral related to unrealized positions to net against derivative assets while derivative liabilities are shown net of cash collateral of 28 million  as of december 31 2016  dte energy had 2 million  of cash collateral related to unrealized positions to net against derivative assets while derivative liabilities are shown net of cash collateral of 36 million  as of december 31 2015  dte energy recorded cash collateral paid of 18 million  and cash collateral received of 5 million  not related to unrealized derivative positions as of december 31 2016  dte energy recorded cash collateral paid of 6 million  and cash collateral received of 3 million  not related to unrealized derivative positions as of december 31 2015  these amounts are included in accounts receivable and accounts payable and are recorded net by counterparty

the following represents the cumulative gross volume of dte energys derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2016  



various subsidiaries of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as “hard triggers” state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as “soft triggers” are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2016  dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was approximately 429 million  

as of december 31 2016  dte energy had approximately 487 million  of derivatives in net liability positions for which hard triggers exist there is no  collateral that has been posted against such liabilities including cash and letters of credit associated derivative net asset positions for which contractual offset exists were approximately 433 million  the net remaining amount of approximately 54 million  is derived from the 429 million  noted above

the cross state air pollution rule csapr required further reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides nox emissions beginning in january 2015 on september 7 2016 the epa finalized an update to the csapr ozone season program by issuing the csapr update rule beginning in may 2017 this rule is expected to reduce summertime may  september nox emissions from power plants in 22  states in the eastern half of the us including dte energy facilities the csapr update rule is intended to reduce air quality impacts of the interstate transport of air pollution on downwind areas ability to meet the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards implementing power sector emission budgets and nox allowance trading programs dte electric expects to meet its obligations under csapr dte electric does not expect this rule to have a material effect on its compliance program 

the mercury and air toxics standards mats rule formerly known as the electric generating unit maximum achievable control technology rule was finalized in december 2011 the mats rule required reductions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants beginning in april 2015 dte electric requested and was granted compliance date extensions for all relevant units to april 2016 in november 2014 the us supreme court agreed to review a challenge to the mats rule based on a narrowly focused question of how the epa considered costs in regulating air pollutants emitted by electric utilities in june 2015 the us supreme court reversed the decision of the court of appeals for the dc district and remanded the mats rule to the court of appeals for further consideration based on their decision that the epa must consider costs prior to deciding to regulate under the provisions of the clean air act subsequently in december 2015 the court of appeals ordered a remand of the mats rule back to the epa without staying the rule a petition to the us supreme court for review of the dc circuit’s remand of the rule was denied in april 2016 leaving the mats rule in place dte electric is currently substantially in compliance with the rule at all regulated units although various issues surrounding the mats rule remain subject to litigation in the dc circuit at this time dte electric does not expect future decisions to have a material effect on its compliance program 

the epa proposed revised air quality standards for ground level ozone in november 2014 and specifically requested comments on the form and level of the ozone standards the standards were finalized in october 2015 the state of michigan recommended designations to the epa in october 2016 and the epa will finalize designations by october 2017 dte electric cannot predict the financial impact of the revised ozone standards at this time 

in july 2009 dte energy received a novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five  dte electric power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and operating permit requirements under the clean air act in june 2010 the epa issued a novfov making similar allegations related to a project and outage at unit 2 of the monroe power plant in march 2013 dte energy received a supplemental nov from the epa relating to the july 2009 novfov the supplemental nov alleged additional violations relating to the new source review provisions under the clean air act among other things 

in august 2010 the us department of justice at the request of the epa brought a civil suit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against dte energy and dte electric related to the june 2010 novfov and the outage work performed at unit 2 of the monroe power plant in august 2011 the us district court judge granted dte energys motion for summary judgment in the civil case dismissing the case and entering judgment in favor of dte energy and dte electric in october 2011 the epa caused to be filed a notice of appeal to the court of appeals for the sixth circuit in march 2013 the court of appeals remanded the case to the us district court for review of the procedural component of the new source review notification requirements in september 2013 the epa caused to be filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint regarding the june 2010 novfov adding additional claims related to outage work performed at the trenton channel and belle river power plants as well as additional claims related to work performed at the monroe power plant in march 2014 the us district court judge granted again dte energys motion for summary judgment dismissing the civil case related to monroe unit 2 in april 2014 the us district court judge granted motions filed by the epa and the sierra club to amend their new source review complaint adding additional claims for monroe units 1 2 and 3 belle river units 1 and 2 and trenton channel unit 9 in october 2014 the epa and the us department of justice filed a notice of appeal of the us district court judges dismissal of the monroe unit 2 case the amended new source review claims were all stayed until the appeal is resolved by the court of appeals for the sixth circuit oral arguments for the appeal occurred in december 2015 on january 10 2017 a divided panel of the court reversed the decision of the us district court dte energy and dte electric have 45 days from the date of the sixth circuit court judgment to petition the court for rehearing or for a hearing en banc

the registrants believe that the plants and generating units identified by the epa and the sierra club have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations depending upon the outcome of the litigation and further discussions with the epa regarding the two  novsfovs dte electric could be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution 

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing egus the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on dte electric since dte electric has no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards in february 2016 the us supreme court granted petitioners requests for a stay of the carbon rules for existing egus also known as the epa clean power plan pending final review by the courts the clean power plan has no legal effect while the stay is in place it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the epa clean power plan on existing sources at this time 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

to comply with air pollution requirements dte electric spent approximately 24 billion  through 2016  dte electric does not  anticipate additional capital expenditures through 2023  

water  — in response to an epa regulation dte electric was required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intake structures a final rule became effective in october 2015 the final rule requires studies to be completed by april 2018 to determine the type of technology needed to reduce impacts to fish dte electric has initiated the process of completing the required studies final compliance for the installation of any required technology will be determined by each state on a case by case site specific basis dte electric is currently evaluating the compliance options and working with the state of michigan on evaluating whether any controls are needed these evaluationsstudies may require modifications to some existing intake structures it is not possible to quantify the impact of this rulemaking at this time 

contaminated and other sites  — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites dte electric conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including three  former mgp sites the investigations have revealed contamination related to the byproducts of gas manufacturing at each mgp site in addition to the mgp sites dte electric is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites including the area surrounding an ash landfill electrical distribution substations electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations the findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years at december 31 2016  and 2015  dte electric had 8 million  accrued for remediation any change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect dte electric’s financial position and cash flows dte electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site 

coal combustion residuals and effluent limitations guidelines — a final epa rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals commonly known as coal ash became effective in october 2015 dte electric owns and operates three  permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coalfired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants at certain facilities the rule requires the installation of monitoring wells compliance with groundwater standards and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant or as a basin becomes inactive at other facilities the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks

in november 2015 the epa finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which may require additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023 compliance schedules for individual facilities and individual waste streams are determined through issuance of new wastewater permits by the state of michigan no new permits have been issued consequently no compliance timelines have been established certain effluent limitations guidelines requirements will be required to be performed in conjunction with the coal combustion residuals requirements costs associated with the building of new facilities or installation of controls over the next 6  years to comply with coal combustion residuals requirements and effluent limitations guidelines are estimated to be approximately 296 million  

dte gas 

contaminated and other sites — dte gas owns or previously owned 14  former mgp sites investigations have revealed contamination related to the byproducts of gas manufacturing at each site cleanup of six  of the mgp sites is complete and the sites are closed dte gas has also completed partial closure of two  additional sites cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years the mpsc has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former mgp sites in addition to the mgp sites dte gas is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites including gate stations gas pipeline releases and underground storage tank locations as of december 31 2016  and 2015  dte gas had 43 million  and 22 million  accrued for remediation respectively the increase in the accrual was primarily due to additional cleanup efforts identified in 2016 at an mgp site any change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect dte gas financial position and cash flows dte gas anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc which allows for amortization of the mgp costs over a ten year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on dte gas results of operations 

nonutility 

dte energys nonutility businesses are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants 

the district attorneys office of yolo county california is investigating the ash management and disposition practices of woodland biomass power ltd and dte woodland llc whollyowned subsidiaries of dte energy the woodland companies a renewable woodfired power generation facility the district attorney has alleged that some of the ash generated at the woodland companies generating facility should have been characterized and handled as hazardous waste under california regulation woodland is cooperating with the investigation and has committed to remove or remediate any ash that was improperly characterized the investigation will likely result in a negotiated settlement including reimbursement of the district attorneys investigation costs as of december 31 2016  dte energy had approximately 4 million  accrued for this matter changes in estimated remediation and settlement costs if any that occur upon completion of the investigation are not expected to have a material impact on dte energy’s consolidated financial statements 

other 

in 2010 the epa finalized a new one hour sulfur dioxide ambient air quality standard that requires states to submit plans for nonattainment areas to be in compliance by 2018 michigans nonattainment area includes dte energy facilities in southwest detroit and areas of wayne county modeling runs by the mdeq suggest that emission reductions may be required by significant sources of sulfur dioxide emissions in these areas including dte electric power plants and dte energys michigan coke battery facility as part of the state implementation plan process dte energy has worked with mdeq to develop air permits reflecting significant so2 emission reductions that in combination with other nondte energy sources emission reduction strategies will help the state attain the standard and sustain its attainment since several nondte energy sources are also part of the proposed compliance plan dte energy is unable to determine the full impact of the final required emissions reductions at this time

the increase  in 2016   net income attributable to dte energy company  is primarily due to higher earnings in the electric and power and industrial projects segments the decrease  in 2015   net income attributable to dte energy company  is primarily due to lower earnings in the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

dte energys utilities are investing capital to improve customer reliability through investments in base infrastructure and new generation and to comply with environmental requirements dte energy expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte energy is focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability dte energy operates in a constructive regulatory environment and has solid relationships with its regulators 

dte energy has significant investments in nonutility businesses dte energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets skills and expertise and provides diversity in earnings and geography specifically dte energy invests in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile dte energy expects growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity dte energy has an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

energy legislation 

on december 21 2016 the governor of michigan signed michigan senate bills 437438 into law senate bills 437438 set out to address michigans electric supply reliability protect retail open access support the transition to cleaner energy and ensure the cost competitiveness of michigans infrastructure transformation the legislation will be effective on april 20 2017 and involves a number of regulatory proceedings and processes that will be implemented over a period of years the following are key provisions of the law 

retail open access provisions — the legislation maintains the current 10 availability for retail access and continues the queue for utility customers who wish to switch from utility service to retail access current retail access customers have the right to expand their energy usage at existing facilities beyond the 10 cap the bill also provides the potential for periodic downward adjustments to the 10 cap where the mpsc determines that retail open access load dropped below the 10 cap cap reductions would go into effect in the year of the mpsc determination and for 5 years thereafter the cap may return to 10 if not adjusted for 6 consecutive calendar years 

resource adequacy requirements and establishment of a capacity charge — the mpsc will implement a process to address adequacy of electric supply that will consider a variety of mechanisms including capacity forward auctions a prevailing state compensation mechanism a state reliability mechanism and a state capacity charge the process is designed to require timely demonstration that sufficient capacity will be secured for all customers to facilitate resource adequacy 

 28 

integrated resource planning process irp and certificate of necessity con — utilities are required to file an irp no later than 2 years after the effective date of the act to plan for a range of cost factors including fuel costs demand forecasts resource adequacy competitive pricing environmental regulations and transmission options before constructing major projects the irp a comprehensive planning process will be coordinated with the current con process new base load generation facilities with 225mw of capacity or higher must use the con process the voluntary threshold for use of the con process will be reduced from 500 million to 100 million 

regulatory reform — the legislation requires the mpsc to review its policies on a regular basis for qualifying facilities under the public utilities regulatory policies act purpa the current twelvemonth deadline for the mpsc to complete a base rate case will be reduced to 10 months after a rate filing the ability of utilities to selfimplement rates six months after a base rate filing will be eliminated 

renewable portfolio standard rps and energy efficiency — a new goal to achieve 35 renewable energyenergy waste reduction by 2025 will be established the current renewable energy requirements are increasing from 10 to 15 by 2021 utilities must achieve 125 by 2019 a voluntary green pricing program will be established and allow customers to request that a certain portion of their energy come from renewable sources utilities are authorized to create onbill financing programs for residential customers who wish to invest in energy efficiency or clean energy installation projects 

net metering — the mpsc will conduct a study on an appropriate tariff reflecting equitable cost of service for utility revenue requirements for net metering customers the mpsc will approve such a tariff in any rate case filed after june 1 2018 

code of conduct reform — value added programs and services vaps — the legislation will allow utilities to offer vaps if the program does not unduly restrain trade or competition in an unregulated market vaps are programs and services that are utility or energy related and may include but are not limited to home comfort and protection appliance service building energy performance alternative energy options or engineering or constructions services 

dte energy was involved in the legislative process leading to the passage of senate bills 437438 and is incorporating the new requirements into its capital and regulatory planning process 

the foregoing discussion is included as a summary only moreover the legislation is subject to future rulemaking which has yet to occur for a complete review of the aforementioned legislation please visit michigans legislation website at wwwlegislaturemigov  

capital investments 

dte energys utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

dte electrics capital investments over the 20172021  period are estimated at 84 billion  comprised of 32 billion  for maintenance and other projects 32 billion  for distribution infrastructure and 20 billion  for new generation dte electric has retired three coalfired generation units at the trenton channel and river rouge facilities and has announced plans to retire an additional eight coalfired generating units through 2023 at the trenton channel river rouge and st clair facilities the retired facilities will be replaced with natural gasfired generation and renewables dte electric plans to build natural gas turbine plants to provide approximately 1000 megawatts of energy between 2021 and 2023 in september 2016 dte electric received an order from the mpsc in its amended renewable energy plan approving two 150 megawatt wind projects expected to be constructed and in service between 2018 and 2020 and 25 megawatts of companyowned solar projects which will be constructed and in service between 2019 and 2020 dte electric is also currently constructing 50 megawatts of solar generation expected to be in service mid2017 dte electric plans to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

dte gas capital investments over the 20172021  period are estimated at 18 billion  comprised of 10 billion  for base infrastructure 700 million  for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs and 100 million  for expenditures related to the nexus pipeline dte gas plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings for base infrastructure capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  for a description of dte gas irm 

 29 

dte energys nonutility businesses capital investments are primarily for expansion growth and ongoing maintenance gas storage and pipelines capital investments over the 20172021  period are estimated at 22 billion  to 28 billion  for gathering and pipeline investments and expansions including the nexus pipeline power and industrial projects capital investments over the 20172021  period are estimated at 600 million  to 10 billion  for investments in cogeneration and onsite energy projects 

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially the registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers 

dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the epa and the state of michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide mercury and other emissions additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and other hazardous air pollutants to comply with these requirements dte electric spent approximately 24 billion  through 2016  dte electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures through 2023  

the epa has implemented regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing egus the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on dte electric since dte electric has no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards in february 2016 the us supreme court granted petitioners requests for a stay of the carbon rules for existing egus also known as the epa clean power plan pending final review by the courts the clean power plan has no legal effect while the stay is in place it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the epa clean power plan on existing sources at this time 

pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

increased costs for energy produced from traditional coalbased sources due to recent pending and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable natural gasfired generation andor nuclear sources energy efficiency initiatives and the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon instruments which could provide new business opportunities for dte energys utility and nonutility segments at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on the registrants or their customers 

see items 1 and 2 business and properties and note 18  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  commitments and contingencies  for further discussion of environmental matters

progress continues on development activities on the nexus pipeline a transportation path to transport appalachian basin shale gas including utica and marcellus shale gas directly to consuming markets in northern ohio southeastern michigan and dawn ontario dte energy owns a 50 partnership interest in the nexus pipeline with an investment balance of 322 million  at december 31 2016  a ferc application was filed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the departure of one of the three ferc commissioners on february 3 2017 a necessary quorum of three ferc commissioners no longer exists thereby delaying pipeline approvals until a new commissioner is appointed however given a timely new ferc commissioner appointment and ferc order dte remains committed to a fourth quarter 2017 inservice date for the nexus pipeline 

the october 2016 acquisition of ags and sgg provides a platform for midstream growth and access to further investment opportunities in the appalachian basin an additional connection to the nexus pipeline which should drive incremental volumes on the nexus pipeline and a new set of producer relationships that may lead to more partnering opportunities 

gas storage and pipelines expects to maintain its steady growth by developing an asset portfolio with multiple growth platforms through investment in new projects and expansions gas storage and pipelines will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other storage and pipeline projects at favorable prices

power and industrial projects 

the power and industrial projects segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity from renewable energy projects power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



gross margin   decreased   121 million  in 2016  and increased   11 million  in 2015  the 2016   decrease  was primarily due to a 58 million decrease associated with the closure of the shenango coke battery a 56 million decrease due to lower demand in the steel business and a 12 million decrease primarily due to termination of a lease arrangement in the ref business offset by a 4 million increase primarily due to lower fuel cost in a renewable power project business the 2015   increase  was primarily due to an 8 million increase in production at a renewable power project a 6 million increase in pricing at two landfill gas projects a 6 million increase associated with a newly constructed project in the onsite business and a 5 million increase in production in the ref business partially offset by a 13 million decrease in product sales at the steel projects for more information on the shenango coke battery closure see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  acquisitions and exit activities  

operation and maintenance   expense   decreased   59 million  in 2016  and increased   11 million  in 2015  the 2016   decrease  was primarily due to 68 million of lower spending as a result of the closure of the shenango coke battery cost control due to lower demand in the steel business and 4 million of lower spending primarily due to the closure a renewable power project partially offset by a 14 million increase associated with new projects in the ref business the 2015   increase  was primarily due to costs associated with closure of the shenango coke battery 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased  by 6 million  in 2016  and increased  by 1 million  in 2015  the 2016   decrease  was due primarily to the closure of shenango coke battery at the end of 2015 

asset gains losses and impairments net   increased  by 107 million  in 2016  and decreased  by 118 million  in 2015  the 2016   increase  was due primarily to a loss associated with the closure of the shenango coke battery recorded in the prior year the 2015   decrease  was due primarily to the closure of the shenango coke battery and a renewable power project 

other income and deductions   decreased   6 million  in 2016  and decreased   8 million  in 2015  the 2016   decrease  was due primarily to 9 million related to the reduction of refined coal produced at ref sites with investors and 8 million of lower equity earnings primarily from a renewable power project offset by an 11 million increase related to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations recorded in the prior year the 2015   decrease  was due primarily to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other notforprofit organizations 

 37 

income taxes — benefit   decreased  by 23 million  in 2016  and increased  by 46 million  in 2015  the 2016   decrease  was primarily driven by a lower pretax loss of 33 million offset by a 10 million worthless stock deduction due to the shenango closure the increase  in 2015  was primarily due to the impact of the closure of the shenango coke battery and a renewable power project 

income taxes — production tax credits increased  by 23 million  in 2016  and decreased   6 million  in 2015  the 2016   increase  was primarily due to new projects in the ref business the 2015   decrease  was primarily due to the reduction of ownership interests in the ref projects 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased  by 32 million  in 2016  and decreased  by 13 million  in 2015  the 2016   decrease  consists of 27 million due to new lease arrangements and 5 million due to existing lease arrangements with investors at various ref facilities the 2015  loss allocated to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to lease arrangements with investors at various ref facilities 

outlook —  power and industrial projects has constructed and placed in service ref facilities at eleven sites including facilities located at eight thirdparty owned coalfired power plants dte energy has sold membership interests in four of the facilities and entered into lease arrangements in three of the facilities dte energy will continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors or entering into lease arrangements for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites dte energy is in the process of entering into a sub license agreement with a new thirdparty owned and operated ref facility 

dte energy expects lower production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2017 a downturn in the steel industry in the united states will continue to negatively impact the volume and pricing of metallurgical coke sales for the nearterm the segment has four renewable power generation facilities in operation onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts dte energy will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other energy projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and natural gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers energy trading results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations and  purchased power and gas — nonutility  were impacted by an increase in volumes partially offset by a decrease in gas prices for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily in the gas structured strategy for 2015  these line items were impacted by a decrease in gas prices partially offset by an increase in volumes primarily in the gas structured strategy 

gross margin   decreased   19 million  in 2016  and decreased   242 million  in 2015  the decrease  in 2016  and the decrease  in 2015  were primarily due to timing from mtm adjustments on certain transactions in the gas structured strategy 

 38 

the decrease  in gross margin in 2016  represents a 46 million decrease in unrealized margins offset by a 27 million increase in realized margins the 46 million decrease in unrealized margins was due to 74 million of unfavorable results primarily in gas structured gas full requirements gas transportation and power trading strategies offset by 28 million of favorable results primarily in gas trading and power full requirements strategies the 27 million increase in realized margins was due to 48 million of favorable results primarily in power full requirements gas full requirements power trading and gas structured strategies offset by 21 million of unfavorable results primarily in the gas transportation strategy 

the decrease  in gross margin in 2015  represents a 155 million decrease in realized margins and an 87 million decrease in unrealized margins the 155 million decrease in realized margins was due to 201 million of unfavorable results primarily in gas structured and power trading strategies offset by 46 million of favorable results primarily in power full requirements and gas transportation strategies the 87 million decrease in unrealized margins was due to 120 million of unfavorable results primarily in the gas structured strategy offset by 33 million of favorable results primarily in power full requirements and gas transportation strategies 

during the first quarter of 2015 energy trading experienced slightly colder than normal weather conditions on average in the gas and power markets served unlike the extreme weather conditions in the midwest and northeast that energy trading experienced in the first quarter of 2014 consequently this led to less favorable results in gas asset optimization strategies due to lower gas prices as compared to 2014 partially offset by lower realized losses from energy tradings power full requirements strategy as compared to 2014 

natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future andor natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related nonderivative pipeline transportation contract these gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are markedtomarket without revaluing the related nonderivative contracts included in the 74 million of unfavorable unrealized results for the year ended december 31 2016 related to gas strategies was 46 million of timing related losses which will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle included in the 21 million of unfavorable realized results for the year ended december 31 2016 related to gas strategies was 4 million of timing related gains recognized in previous periods that reversed as the underlying contracts settled 

included in the 201 million of unfavorable realized results for the year ended december 31 2015 related to gas strategies was 113 million of timing related gains and losses recognized in previous years that reversed as the underlying contracts settled the 113 million of timing related items was comprised of a reversal of timing related losses of 65 million in 2014 and a reversal of timing gains of 48 million in 2015 included in the 120 million of unfavorable unrealized results for the year ended december 31 2015 related to gas strategies was 126 million of timing related gains and losses the 126 million of timing related items was the variance of timing gains of 102 million in 2014 and timing losses of 24 million in 2015 which will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle 

other income and deductions  increased 23 million in 2016 due primarily to contributions to the dte energy foundation 

outlook —  in the nearterm energy trading expects market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of rtos significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result energy trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets energy tradings strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and holds energyrelated investments the 2016   net loss  of 61 million  represents an increase  of 13 million  from the 2015   net loss  of 48 million  due primarily to state tax adjustments related to the gas storage and pipelines acquisition and the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redemption of junior subordinated debentures the 2015   net loss  of 48 million  represents an improvement  of 9 million  from the 2014   net loss  of 57 million  due primarily to 2014 investment impairments and lower deferred tax expense related to the impact of new york state income tax reform enacted in march 2014 partially offset by higher interest expense

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

dte energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities to grow the nonutility businesses to retire and pay interest on longterm debt and to pay dividends dte energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements dte energy expects that cash from operations in 2017  will be approximately 19 billion  dte energy anticipates base level utility capital investments environmental renewable and energy optimization expenditures expenditures for nonutility businesses and contributions to equity method investees in 2017  of approximately 30 billion  dte energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

 40 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of dte energys operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric retail access regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

cash from operations increased   168 million  in 2016  the increase  in operating cash flows reflects an increase in net income and adjustments for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation and amortization partially offset by decreases from asset gains losses and impairments net and working capital items 

cash from operations increased   71 million  in 2015  the increase  in operating cash flows reflects a decrease in cash expenditures for working capital items partially offset by lower net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items the decreases in depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes are partially offset by the increase in asset gains losses and impairments net which is primarily due to dte energys closure of the shenango coke battery plant in 2015 see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  acquisitions and exit activities  

 41 

the change in working capital items in 2016  primarily related to increases in cash used for accounts receivable net and regulatory assets and liabilities partially offset by increases in cash from accounts payable the accrued pension liability and the accrued postretirement liability the change in working capital items in 2015  primarily related to increases in regulatory assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities accounts receivable net and inventories partially offset by decreases in accrued pension liability accrued postretirement liability and accounts payable 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions in any given year dte energy looks to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within the nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth dte energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis dte energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria for new business lines dte energy initially invests based on research and analysis dte energy starts with a limited investment evaluates the results and either expands or exits the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of dte energy with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings 

net cash used for  investing activities increased   12 billion  in 2016  due primarily to dte energys acquisition of midstream natural gas assets net of cash acquired of 83 million  of 11 billion  as described in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  acquisitions and exit activities  as well as increased contributions to equity method investees primarily the nexus pipeline as it continues to develop 

net cash used for  investing activities increased   144 million  in 2015  due primarily to dte energys 241 million  acquisition in january 2015 this is partially offset by the increase in restricted cash for debt redemption as this activity primarily relates to securitization bonds that were fully redeemed in march 2015 

cash from financing activities 

dte energy relies on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations 

dte energys strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity dte energy continually evaluates its leverage target which is currently 50 to 53 to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from  financing activities increased   11 billion  in 2016  the increase  is primarily attributable to increases in issuances of longterm debt and equity units which are partially offset by increased redemptions of longterm debt and a decrease in shortterm borrowings net the increased issuances in 2016  were primarily related to the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets see details in the acquisition financing section of note 14  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  longterm debt  

net cash from  financing activities increased   66 million  in 2015  the increase  is primarily attributable to decreased redemptions of longterm debt which is offset by decreases in issuances of longterm debt shortterm borrowings and repurchase of common stock 

 42 

outlook 

dte energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from the utility and nonutility businesses growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments in october 2016 dte energy closed on an acquisition of midstream natural gas assets that are part of the gas storage and pipelines segment see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions and exit activities  for more information the acquisition was financed through the issuance of equity units and senior notes see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements  longterm debt  for more information 

dte energy may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future dte energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of longterm capital projects 

dte energy has approximately 15 million  in longterm debt including capital leases maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 15 billion  of available liquidity at december 31 2016  consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making 2017  contributions to the pension plans of up to 310 million  and does not anticipate making any contributions to the other postretirement benefit plans 

various subsidiaries and an equity investee of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as hard triggers state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as soft triggers are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2016  dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was approximately 429 million  

dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of dte energys businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows

contractual obligations 

the following table details dte energys including dte electrics contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2016  



 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews

in october 2016 moodys downgraded dte energys unsecured debt rating from a3 to baa1 following the midstream natural gas assets acquisition 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the registrants consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements the registrants management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of the registrants businesses are subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses the registrants management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  

derivatives 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2016  and 2015  the registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values the registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the registrants estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices the registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts see the sensitivity analysis in item 7a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 12 and 13  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the registrants each establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and their respective managements assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for dte electric and dte gas is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances the registrants believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 

 45 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of dte energys reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations dte energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test dte energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test dte energy estimates the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance dte energy also employs marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

dte energy performs an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests dte energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while dte energy believes the assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact dte energys earnings 

dte energy performed its annual impairment test as of october 1 2016  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed as part of the annual impairment test dte energy also compared the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to its overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity 

the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the october 1 2016  valuation date 



 



 46 

longlived assets 

the registrants evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require the registrants to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact their earnings 

dte energy operates a coke battery with assets of approximately 101 million within the power and industrial projects reporting unit dte energy continues to monitor the steel industry as further deterioration could lead to a future impairment of the assets 

pension and other postretirement costs 

dte energy sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the registrants the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required dte energy considers historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

dte energy had pension costs of 167 million  in 2016  221 million  in 2015  and 179 million  in 2014  other postretirement benefit credits were 111 million  in 2016  99 million  in 2015  and 123 million  in 2014  pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for 2016  are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 775  for the pension plans and 800  for the other postretirement benefit plans in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumptions dte energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets dte energys 2017  expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47  in equity markets 25  in fixed income markets including long duration bonds and 28  invested in other assets dte energys 2017  expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 41  in equity markets 25  in fixed income markets and 34  invested in other assets because of market volatility dte energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions and financial market risk considerations dte energy is decreasing its longterm rate of return assumptions for the pension plans from 775  in 2016  to 750  in 2017  and the other postretirement plans from 800  in 2016  to 775  in 2017  dte energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rate of return on the plan assets for 2017  given its investment strategy dte energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions including its expected rate of return at least annually

dte energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for the pension plans dte energy uses a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2016  modestly detracted from dte energys investment performance resulting in unrecognized net losses as of december 31 2016  dte energy had 410 million  of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets related to investment performance in 2016  and 2015  for the other postretirement benefit plans dte energy uses fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that dte energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans the discount rate determined on this basis was 425  for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2016  compared to 450  for the pension and other postretirement plans at december 31 2015  

the mortality assumptions that dte energy used to determine the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2016  were updated to incorporate the mp2016 generational projection scale issued by the society of actuaries in 2016 the mortality assumptions used at december 31 2016  are the rp2014 mortality table with variations by type of plan and participant’s union status and employment status projected back to 2006 using scale mp2014 and projected forward using scale mp2016 

dte energy estimates the 2017  total pension costs will be consistent with the 2016  pension costs at approximately 175 million  in 2017  the reduction in pension costs from the update to the mortality assumptions was offset by a lower discount rate and a decrease from 2016  expected returns the 2017  other postretirement benefit credit will approximate 16 million  compared to a 110 million  credit in 2016  primarily due to 20122013 plan change credits being fully recognized in 2017 

the health care trend rates for dte energy assume 650  for pre65 participants and 675  for post65 participants for 2017  trending down to 450  for both pre65 and post65 participants in 2028  

future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2016  pension costs by approximately 40 million  lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2016  pension costs by approximately 33 million  lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2016  other postretirement credit by approximately 16 million  lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have decreased the 2016  other postretirement credit by approximately 26 million  lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the other postretirement credit for 2016  by approximately 5 million  

the value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 58 billion  at december 31 2016  and 54 billion  at december 31 2015  at december 31 2016  dte energys qualified pension plans were underfunded by 10 billion  and its other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 37 million  the 2016  funding levels modestly improved as plan sponsor contributions and favorable mortality changes offset a lower discount rate and modestly lower financial market returns 

 48 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets dte energy made contributions to its qualified pension plans of 179 million  in 2016  and 177 million  in 2015  at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to 310 million  in 2017  and up to 12 billion  over the next five years dte energy made other postretirement benefit plan contributions of 20 million  in 2016  and 199 million  in 2015  dte energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement plans in 2017  or over the next five years the planned pension contributions will be made in cash or a combination of cash and dte energy common stock

legal reserves 

the registrants are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon the registrants management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the registrants 

accounting for tax obligations 

the registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold the registrants also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the consolidated financial statements the registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2016  and 2015  are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the registrants consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts dte energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power natural gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items dte energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation contracts renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 12 and 13  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in the registrants reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

 49 

the registrants manage their mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value

interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt in order to manage interest costs dte energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements dte energys exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and libor as of december 31 2016  dte energy had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately 43  

 51 

foreign currency exchange risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit dte energys exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations dte energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through december 2020  

summary of sensitivity analyses 

the registrants performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values of commodity contracts and longterm debt obligations the commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at december 31 2016  and 2015  by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values

operating revenues by service 



 

  6 

weather economic factors competition energy efficiency initiatives and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers dte electrics peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands dte electrics operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte electric 

fuel supply and purchased power 

dte electrics power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power dte electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers dte electrics generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms dte electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases dte electric has longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 379 million tons of lowsulfur western coal and approximately 30 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2016 to 2021 all of these contracts have pricing schedules dte electric has approximately 98 of the expected coal requirements for 2016 under contract given the geographic diversity of supply dte electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements dte electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western coal rail requirements under contract through 2018 all of the expected eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2016 contracts covering expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities are under contract through 2019 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso dte electric offers its generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load dte electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages 

properties 

dte electric owns generating facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of dte electrics property is subject to the lien of a mortgage

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance that qualifying customers receive dte electric works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the service territory dte electric also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to customers 

strategy and competition 

dte electrics electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner with potential capacity constraints in the miso region there will be increased dependency on dte electrics generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers this generation will require a large investment due to dte electrics aging coal fleet along with increased environmental regulations 

dte electrics distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to customers dte electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

the electric retail access program in michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total retail access related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on dte electrics financial performance and full service customer rates dte electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales in 2016  

 9 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers dte electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

gas 

description 

dte energys gas segment consists principally of dte gas a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 12 million  residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity 

operating revenues by service 



 dte gas gas sales enduser transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of the business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and dte gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in average customer usage are minimized by the rdm 

dte gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of dte gas 

natural gas supply 

dte gas gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 24 bcf with approximately 66 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2015  peakuse requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity dte gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements dte gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

 10 

dte gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify dte gas natural gas supply base natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpscapproved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2018 

dte gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions the primary longterm transportation supply contracts at december 31 2015 are as follows 



properties 

dte gas owns distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan the distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1165000 service pipelines and approximately 1314000 active meters and dte gas owns approximately 2000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect dte gas storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

dte gas owns storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 141 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to dte gas customers in addition dte gas sells storage services to third parties 

most of dte gas distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by dte gas through easements permits or licenses substantially all of dte gas property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

dte gas leases a portion of its pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 16  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report  capital and operating leases  

regulation 

dte gas is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte gas mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on investments dte gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff 

dte gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the fercs jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by dte gas in interstate markets ferc granted dte gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates dte gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte gas ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte gas uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive dte gas works continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in the gas service territory dte gas also partners with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to dte gas customers 

strategy and competition 

dte gas strategy is to ensure the safe reliable and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in michigan in addition dte gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to under served markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces water heaters and appliances within its current customer base dte gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy efficiency products and services to its customers making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for enduser transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for dte gas enduser transportation service dte gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by its storage capacity 

having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of dte gas storage and transportation services to gas producers marketers distribution companies enduser customers and other pipeline companies the business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow its steel onsite energy renewable power and ref businesses power and industrial projects will also continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for power and industrial projects existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services power and industrial projects operations are dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects anticipates building around its core strengths in the markets where it operates in determining the markets in which to compete power and industrial projects examines closely the regulatory and competitive environment new and pending legislation the number of competitors and its ability to achieve sustainable margins power and industrial projects plans to maximize the effectiveness of its related businesses as it expands as power and industrial projects pursues growth opportunities the first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

power and industrial projects intends to focus on the following areas for growth 

 energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers energy tradings customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies energy trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of their marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the mtm method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives energy trading utilizes forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory contracts for pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the business’ strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the cftc us department of homeland security and doe in addition energy trading is subject to applicable laws rules and regulations in canada 

strategy and competition 

dte energys strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to dte energy customers dte energy seeks to manage this business in a manner complementary to the growth of dte energys other business segments energy trading focuses on physical marketing and the optimization of its portfolio of energy assets the segment competes with electric and gas marketers financial institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the energy trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating dte energy believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities dte energy monitors its use of capital closely to ensure that its commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact energy tradings financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage dte energy has risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers the following table summarizes dte energys including dte electrics estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations the amounts reported in the following table do not include any expenditures related to the epa clean power plan as discussed below actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



air  — dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the epa and the state of michigan have issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide with further emission controls planned for reductions of mercury and other emissions these rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years 

 16 

the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing electric generating units egus the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on dte electric since dte electric has no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the final carbon standards also known as the epa clean power plan on existing sources at this time pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on dte electrics operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical dte electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

water  — the epa finalized regulations on cooling water intake in august 2014 dte electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes 

contaminated and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites dte gas owns or previously owned fourteen such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites dte energy anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse effect on dte energys operations dte electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each of its sites 

the registrants are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electric distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the registrants financial position and cash flows and the rates charged to their customers 

coal combustion residuals and effluent limitations guidelines — in april 2015 the epa published a final rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals commonly known as coal ash the rule became effective in october 2015 the rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a nonhazardous waste and relies on various selfimplementation design and performance standards dte electric owns and operates 3  permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coalfired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants at certain facilities the rule requires the installation of monitoring wells compliance with groundwater standards and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant at other facilities the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks 

in november 2015 the epa finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which may require additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023 the initial costs to comply with this rule have been developed and included in the coal combustion residual and effluent limitations guidelines amount in the above table

 item 1a   risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of the registrants utility businesses and dte energys nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the registrants below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses although the registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect performance 

the registrants are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization the registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies the registrants ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations the registrants utilities typically selfimplement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with michigan law however if the final rates authorized by regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts the registrants collected during the selfimplementation period the registrants must refund the difference with interest regulators may also disagree with the registrants rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business if the registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact the registrants ability to recover certain costs through customer rates regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for the registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers the registrants cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how the business operates impact the registrants ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery or require the registrants to incur additional expenses the outcome of the current michigan energy policy reform legislative process could impact the registrants recovery of costs through rates 

changes to michigans electric retail access program could negatively impact the registrants financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for dte electric customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan in 2008 have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes the registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity the outcome of the current michigan energy policy reform legislative process could impact the registrants recovery of costs through rates 

the miso regional energy market including the state of michigan is expected to face capacity constraints beginning in 2016 due primarily to the retirement of coalfired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements significant investment in new natural gasfired generation and renewables will be required under the current regulatory structure retail access customers do not fund capacity costs potentially impacting electric supply reliability and utility customer affordability 

environmental laws and liability may be costly the registrants are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in the registrants generation fleet and for dte energy gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require the registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals the registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally the registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body the registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

 18 

the registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulations of ghg emissions are implemented the operations of dte electrics fossilfueled generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process the registrants financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

for dte energy future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of dte energys gas transportation businesses 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects the registrants to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the registrants to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while the registrants maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the registrants costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant which may affect the registrants financial performance in addition while the registrants have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact the registrants financial results the registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity dte energys access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers dte energys nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts dte electric charges utility customers for electricity and dte gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of dte energys nonutility businesses the registrants have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and for dte energy nonutility businesses but there can be no assurances that the registrants financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for dte energys nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact the registrants financial results  the registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of their facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the registrants utility products and for dte energy on the profitability of the nonutility businesses 

adverse changes in the registrants credit ratings may negatively affect them regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in the registrants economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in the registrants credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in the registrants credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact their liquidity 

 19 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the registrants liquidity and results of operations the registrants costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and the registrants required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the registrants plans the registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below the registrants projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the registrants utility customers the results of operations and financial position of the registrants could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets the registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the registrants cash flows financial position or results of operations 

the registrants ability to access capital markets is important the registrants ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain the registrants ability as well as the ability of their subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the registrants access to capital markets the registrants longterm revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2020 but the registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the registrants utilities and dte energys nonutility businesses and the registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

construction and capital improvements to the registrants power facilities and dte energys distribution systems subject them to risk   the registrants are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and dte energys gas distribution system many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the registrants control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits construction disputes and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the registrants financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses 

dte energys nonutility businesses may not perform to its expectations  dte energy relies on nonutility operations for an increasing portion of earnings if dte energys current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels dte energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value 

dte energys participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations dte energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed dte energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose dte energy to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks dte energys trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines dte energy sets resulting from the management of dte energys business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish dte energys financial results and financial position dte energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

dte energys ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources dte energy generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery reduced emission fuel renewable energy generation and gas production operations all production tax credits taken after 2013 are subject to audit by the irs if dte energys production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact dte energys earnings and cash flows 

 20 

weather significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the registrants earnings and cash flows mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the registrants assets lowering income and cash flows at dte electric ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance the registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation the registrants financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs 

dte energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from the utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect the registrants business the registrants are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy the registrants have complied with the existing state legislation but do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation in addition there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources the registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers 

the registrants are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the registrants revenues as customers decrease their energy usage the registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results 

regional national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the registrants the registrants utility and dte energys nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with should the financial conditions of some of dte energys significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional national or international economic conditions reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services dte energy supplies collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows 

threats of terrorism or cyberattacks could affect the registrants business the registrants may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt the registrants operations and could harm the registrants operating results the registrants industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite implementation of security measures all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes if the registrants information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way the registrants might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business operating results and financial condition 

in addition the registrants generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and for dte energy gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products the registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that the registrants cannot currently predict 

 21 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the registrants in connection with the registrants businesses they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers shareholders and employees customers shareholders and employees expect that the registrants will adequately protect their personal information and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the registrants reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the registrants operations the registrants businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the registrants business and future operating results in addition the registrants have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations 

a work interruption may adversely affect the registrants  there are several bargaining units for dte energys approximately 4900  and dte electrics approximately 2600  represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017 a union choosing to strike would have an impact on the registrants businesses the registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance 

if dte energys goodwill becomes impaired it may be required to record a charge to earnings dte energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of dte energy goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in the industry dte energy cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable dte energy may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact dte energys results of operations and financial position 

the registrants businesses have safety risks the registrants electric distribution system power plants wind energy equipment and other facilities and dte energys gas distribution system gas infrastructure and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury death or property loss to employees customers or the public although the registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident they could experience financial loss damage to their reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

the registrants may not be fully covered by insurance the registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the registrants operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or the registrants insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following combined discussion is separately filed by dte energy and dte electric however dte electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to dte energy or the subsidiaries of dte energy other than itself 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2015  operating revenues of approximately 103 billion  and assets of approximately 287 billion  dte energy is the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan dte energy operates three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes dte energys financial results 



the decrease  in 2015   net income attributable to dte energy company  is primarily due to lower earnings in the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments the increase  in 2014   net income attributable to dte energy company  is primarily due to higher earnings in the energy trading electric power and industrial projects and gas storage and pipelines segments 

 26 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

dte energys utilities are investing capital to improve customer reliability through investments in base infrastructure and new generation and to comply with environmental requirements dte energy expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth dte energy is focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability dte energy operates in a constructive regulatory environment and has solid relationships with its regulators 

dte energy has significant investments in nonutility businesses dte energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets skills and expertise and provides diversity in earnings and geography specifically dte energy invests in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile dte energy expects growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity dte energy has an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

dte energys utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

dte electrics capital investments over the 20162020  period are estimated at 82 billion  comprised of 38 billion  for maintenance and other projects 32 billion  for distribution infrastructure and 12 billion  for new generation over the next fifteen years dte electric plans to retire a portion of its coalfired generation and to increase the proportion of its generation mix attributable to natural gasfired generation and renewables dte electric acquired two natural gas facilities in 2015 as described in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report acquisitions and exit activities  dte electric plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings and renewable energy plan filings for capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

dte gas capital investments over the 20162020  period are estimated at 16 billion  comprised of 750 million  for base infrastructure 650 million  for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs and 200 million  for expenditures related to the nexus pipeline dte gas plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings for base infrastructure capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  for a description of dte gas irm 

dte energys nonutility businesses capital investments are primarily for expansion growth and ongoing maintenance gas storage and pipelines capital investments over the 20162020  period are estimated at 20 billion  to 26 billion  for gathering and pipeline investments and expansions including the nexus pipeline power and industrial projects capital investments over the 20162020  period are estimated at 600 million  to 950 million  for investments in cogeneration and onsite energy projects 

environmental matters 

the registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially the registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers

dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the epa and the state of michigan have issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide with further emission controls planned for reductions of mercury and other emissions these rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years to comply with these requirements dte electric spent approximately 23 billion  through 2015  it is estimated that dte electric will make capital expenditures of approximately 40 million  in 2016  

as directed by a june 2013 presidential memorandum the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions in august 2015 the epa finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing electric generating units egus the carbon performance standards known as the clean power plan cpp require states to meet emission reduction targets from existing fossilfueled egus beginning in 2022 the epa has finalized interim standards applicable from 2022 to 2029 leading to emission standards to be achieved in 2030 states must submit initial compliance plans in september 2016 but may request an extension to submit a final compliance plan by september 2018 states that fail to submit a plan or do not meet epa criteria for a complete plan will be subject to a federal plan that was proposed by the epa with the final cpp 

the registrants are working with the state of michigan and other stakeholders to shape the cpp compliance plan for michigan the final carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on the registrants since the registrants have no plans to build new coalfired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards at the present time it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the final performance standards for existing power plants due to the multitude of options available to states for compliance that require careful analysis and input from numerous stakeholders pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on the registrants operations and financial position and the rates the registrants charge its customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical the registrants would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to their utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

increased costs for energy produced from traditional coalbased sources due to recent pending and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable natural gasfired generation andor nuclear sources energy efficiency initiatives and the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon instruments which could provide new business opportunities for dte energys utility and nonutility segments at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on the registrants or their customers

exit activities 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 dte energy announced the closure of the shenango incorporated coke battery plant in response to a sharp downturn in the north american steel industry the plant which is part of the power and industrial projects segment is located in pittsburgh pa as a result of the closure dte energy recorded a onetime pretax noncash impairment charge of 111 million  the charge included 96 million  to fully impair the longlived assets employee severance expenses related to the workforce reduction of approximately 170 employees for 3 million  and other expenses including write downs of inventory of 12 million  the closure optimizes dte energys coke production at its larger more efficient facility production of coke from the shenango battery ceased in january 2016 the plant closure will not significantly impact dte energys earnings in future periods as of december 31 2015  no amounts have been paid to date under these exit activities for amounts accrued at december 31 2015  related to these exit activities dte energy expects future cash payments of approximately 7 million  to be made in 2016 dte energy anticipates incurring additional costs including environmental remediation costs in connection with the closure an estimate of the amount of the additional costs and timing of the activities cannot be determined at december 31 2015  as alternatives are currently being evaluated however the likelihood of these costs being material to dte energys consolidated financial statements is remote 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry dte energys strong utility base combined with its integrated nonutility operations position it well for longterm growth 

 28 

looking forward dte energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance 

 dte energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic financial and risk criteria

 dte electric residential and commercial sales increased due primarily to favorable weather while industrial sales decreased due primarily to lower steel customer load 

operation and maintenance expense   increased   12 million  in 2015  and decreased   45 million  in 2014  the increase  in 2015  is primarily due to increased power plant generation expenses of 28 million increased line clearance expenses of 25 million increased distribution operations expenses of 13 million and 18 million of expenses related to the transition of pld customers to dte electrics distribution system effective july 1 2014 partially offset by decreased storm restoration expenses of 63 million and decreased employee benefits of 7 million the decrease  in 2014  is primarily due to decreased employee benefit expenses of 68 million decreased distribution operations expenses of 36 million and decreased power plant generation expenses of 7 million partially offset by higher storm restoration expenses of 19 million increased lowincome energy assistance of 17 million 17 million of expenses related to the transition of pld customers to dte electrics distribution system and increased energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 13 million the mpsc approved a trm that provides for recovery of the deferred net incremental revenue requirement associated with the transition of former pld customers that is reflected in the depreciation and amortization line in dte electrics consolidated statements of operations 

depreciation and amortization   expense   decreased   296 million  in 2015  and increased   31 million  in 2014  the 2015   decrease  was due to 342 million of decreased amortization of regulatory assets related to securitization and 15 million associated with the trm partially offset by 61 million of increased expenses due to an increased depreciable base the 2014   increase  was due to 42 million of increased expense due to an increased depreciable base and increased amortization of regulatory assets of 3 million primarily related to securitization partially offset by 14 million associated with the trm 

other income and deductions   increased   16 million  in 2015  and decreased   36 million  in 2014  the increase  in 2015  was primarily due to lower investment earnings of 11 million and higher interest expense of 8 million the decrease  in 2014  was primarily due to decreased interest expenses of 18 million and the 2013 contribution to the dte energy foundation of 18 million 

outlook   —  dte electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and electric retail access and effects of energy efficiency programs dte electric residential and commercial sales have increased due primarily to improved economic activity and have been substantially offset by energy efficiency measures taken by customers dte electric expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

 31 

dte electric filed a rate case with the mpsc on february 1 2016 requesting an increase in base rates of 344 million  based on a projected twelvemonth period ending july 31 2017 the requested increase in base rates is due primarily to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments environmental compliance and reliability improvement projects the rate filing also includes projected changes in sales operation and maintenance expenses and working capital the rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 103  to 105  on a capital structure of 50  equity and 50  debt dte electric anticipates selfimplementing a rate increase in august 2016 with an mpsc order expected by february 2017 

gas   

the gas segment consists principally of dte gas gas results are discussed below 



gross margin   decreased   61 million  in 2015  and increased   61 million  in 2014  revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in dte energys consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





operation and maintenance   expense   decreased   26 million  in 2015  and increased   27 million  in 2014  the decrease  in 2015  is primarily due to decreased gas operations expenses of 12 million decreased employee benefits expenses of 10 million decreased transmission expenses of 3 million and decreased uncollectible expenses of 3 million the increase  in 2014  is primarily due to increased gas operations expenses of 32 million increased uncollectible expenses of 4 million and increased corporate administrative expenses of 3 million partially offset by decreased employee benefit expenses of 10 million and reduced energy optimization expenses of 2 million 

 32 

other income and deductions   decreased   27 million  in 2015  and increased   27 million  in 2014  the decrease  in 2015  is primarily due to the 2014 contribution to the dte energy foundation and other charitable organizations the increase  in 2014  is primarily due to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other charitable organizations in 2014 

outlook —  dte gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn its authorized return on equity dte gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs dte gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

dte gas filed a rate case with the mpsc on december 18 2015 requesting an increase in base rates of 183 million  based on a projected twelvemonth period ending october 31 2017 the requested increase in base rates is due primarily to an increase in net plant of 800 million  inclusive of irm capital investments being recovered through approved irm surcharge filings the rate filing also includes projected changes in sales operation and maintenance expenses and working capital the rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 105  to 1075  on a capital structure of 52  equity and 48  debt dte gas anticipates selfimplementing a rate increase in november 2016 with an mpsc order expected by december 2016 concurrent with the mpsc order in this rate case the existing irm surcharge will be terminated however in this rate case filing dte gas requested to implement a new irm surcharge to become effective in january 2017 

gas storage and pipelines 

the gas storage and pipelines segment consists of the nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations   increased   40 million  in 2015  and increased   71 million  in 2014  the 2015   increase  is due primarily to increased volumes on the bluestone pipeline and susquehanna gathering systems partially offset by decreased gas storage revenues due to expiring contracts being replaced with contracts at lower rates the 2014   increase  is due primarily to increased volumes on the bluestone pipeline and additional segments placed in service in the susquehanna gathering system storage revenue also increased due to weather favorability in early 2014 partially offset by lower market rates 

operation and maintenance expense   increased   12 million  in 2015  and increased   21 million  in 2014  the 2015   increase  is due primarily to increased activity on the bluestone and susquehanna projects and increased gas storage operations expense the 2014   increase  is due primarily to increased activity on the bluestone and susquehanna projects and increased corporate overheads due to growth of this segment 

depreciation and amortization   expense   decreased   4 million  in 2015  and increased   11 million  in 2014  the 2015   decrease  is due primarily to a change in the estimated useful life of susquehanna gathering assets related to a contract extension in the fourth quarter of 2014 partially offset by additional bluestone and susquehanna projects placed in service the 2014   increase  is due primarily to the growth of the bluestone and susquehanna projects 

 33 

other income and deductions   increased   10 million  in 2015  and decreased   17 million  in 2014  the 2015   increase  is due primarily to increased earnings from pipeline investments the 2014   decrease  is due primarily to decreased earnings from a pipeline investment and increased intercompany interest expense the earnings from the pipeline investment were negatively impacted in 2014 by a revenue deferral for depreciation collected in fercapproved tariff rates in excess of depreciation expense 

outlook —  gas storage and pipelines expects to maintain its steady growth by developing an asset portfolio with multiple growth platforms through investment in new projects and expansions gas storage and pipelines will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other storage and pipeline projects at favorable prices the 2015 capacity expansion of bluestone pipeline in susquehanna county pennsylvania and broome county new york is complete and included a second compressor facility and approximately six miles of additional pipeline loop to accommodate increased shipper demand planning and design activities are underway for bluestone pipelines 2016 expansion additionally the susquehanna gathering system is being expanded to accommodate increased production despite recent pressure on producers from low commodity prices dte energy believes its longterm agreement with southwestern energy production company and the quality of the natural gas reserves in the marcellus region soundly positions bluestone pipeline and susquehanna gathering system for future growth 

progress continues on development activities on the nexus pipeline a transportation path to transport appalachian basin shale gas including utica and marcellus shale gas directly to consuming markets in northern ohio southeastern michigan and dawn ontario dte energy owns a 50 partnership interest in the nexus pipeline a ferc application was filed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with an estimated in service date in the fourth quarter of 2017 

power and industrial projects 

the power and industrial projects segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity from renewable energy projects power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



gross margin   increased   11 million  in 2015  and decreased   3 million  in 2014  the 2015   increase  is primarily due to an 8 million increase in production at a renewable power project a 6 million increase in pricing at two landfill gas projects a 6 million increase associated with a newly constructed project in the onsite business and a 5 million increase in production in the ref business partially offset by a 13 million decrease in product sales at the steel projects the 2014   decrease  is primarily due to a 13 million decrease in sales associated with project terminations in the onsite energy business 12 million of higher startup costs associated with new projects in the ref business a 3 million decrease in lower pricing in the steel business partially offset by a 19 million increase associated with new renewable power and landfill gas projects and a 6 million increase due to the closing of the coal transportation business 

 34 

operation and maintenance   expense   increased   11 million  in 2015  and increased   25 million  in 2014  the 2015   increase  is primarily due to costs associated with closure of the shenango coke battery the 2014   increase  is primarily due to 16 million of higher maintenance and general administrative expenses in the steel business and 9 million of higher spending associated with the startup of a renewable power project 

depreciation and amortization expense increased  by 1 million  in 2015  and increased  by 5 million  in 2014  the 2014   increase  is primarily due to 4 million associated with the startup of a renewable power project 

asset gains losses and impairments net   decreased  by 118 million  in 2015  and increased  by 8 million  in 2014  the 2015   decrease  is due primarily to the closure of the shenango coke battery and a renewable power project the 2014   increase  is due primarily to a gain associated with a sale of an onsite project in 2014 and an asset impairment recorded in 2013 

other income and deductions   decreased  by 8 million  in 2015  and decreased   7 million  in 2014  the 2015 decrease is due primarily to charitable contributions and the 2014 decrease is due primarily to lower equity earnings at various projects 

income taxes  expense benefits  decreased by 46 million in 2015 the decrease is primarily due to the impact of the closure of the shenango coke battery and a renewable power project 

income taxes  production tax credits   decreased  by 6 million  in 2015  and increased   44 million  in 2014  the 2015 decrease is primarily due to the reduction of ownership interests in the ref projects the 2014 increase is due primarily to higher production volumes of refined coal that resulted in higher tax credits at ref projects 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 13 million in 2015 and decreased by 1 million in 2014 the 2015 loss allocated to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to lease arrangements with investors at various ref facilities 

outlook   —  power and industrial projects has constructed and placed in service ref facilities at nine sites including facilities located at six thirdparty owned coalfired power plants dte energy has sold membership interests in four of the facilities and entered into lease arrangements in two of the facilities dte energy will continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors or entering into lease arrangements for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites dte energy is in the process of relocating underutilized facility equipment at an existing site to a new thirdparty owned coalfired power plant in addition dte energy has entered into an agreement to operate an ref facility owned by an outside party located at a thirdparty owned coalfired power plant 

dte energy expects decreased production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2016 a recent downturn in the steel industry in the united states will likely negatively impact the volume and pricing of metallurgical coke sales for the upcoming year see discussion of potential impairment risk related to longlived steel related assets in the critical accounting estimates section the segment has four renewable power generation facilities in operation onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts dte energy will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other energy projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and natural gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers energy trading results are discussed below 



operating revenues — nonutility operations and  purchased power and gas — nonutility  were impacted by a decrease in gas prices partially offset by an increase in volumes primarily in the gas structured strategy for the year ended december 31 2015  for 2014 these line items were impacted by an increase in gas volumes and prices primarily in the gas structured strategy 

gross margin   decreased   242 million  in 2015  and increased   295 million  in 2014  the decrease  in 2015  and the increase  in 2014  are primarily due to timing from mtm adjustments on certain transactions in the gas structured strategy 

the decrease  in gross margin in 2015  represents a 155 million decrease in realized margins and an 87 million decrease in unrealized margins the 155 million decrease in realized margins is due to 201 million of unfavorable results primarily in gas structured and power trading strategies offset by 46 million of favorable results primarily in power full requirements and gas transportation strategies the 87 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to 120 million of unfavorable results primarily in the gas structured strategy offset by 33 million of favorable results primarily in power full requirements and gas transportation strategies 

the increase  in gross margin in 2014  represents a 92 million increase in realized margins and a 203 million increase in unrealized margins the 92 million increase in realized margins is due to 149 million of favorable results primarily in gas structured and gas transportation strategies offset by 57 million of unfavorable results primarily in power full requirements gas full requirements and gas trading strategies the 203 million increase in unrealized margins is due to 211 million of favorable results primarily in gas structured and gas full requirements strategies offset by 8 million of unfavorable results primarily in the power full requirements strategy 

during the first quarter of 2015 energy trading experienced slightly colder than normal weather conditions on average in the gas and power markets served unlike the extreme weather conditions in the midwest and northeast that energy trading experienced in the first quarter of 2014 consequently this led to less favorable results in gas asset optimization strategies due to lower gas prices as compared to 2014 partially offset by lower realized losses from energy tradings power full requirements strategy as compared to 2014 

 36 

natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future andor natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related nonderivative pipeline transportation contract these gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are markedtomarket without revaluing the related nonderivative contracts included in the 201 million of unfavorable realized results for the year ended december 31 2015 related to gas strategies is 113 million of timing related gains and losses recognized in previous years that reversed as the underlying contracts settled the 113 million of timing related items is comprised of a reversal of timing related losses of 65 million in 2014 and a reversal of timing gains of 48 million in 2015 included in the 120 million of unfavorable unrealized results for the year ended december 31 2015 related to gas strategies is 126 million of timing related gains and losses the 126 million of timing related items is the variance of timing gains of 102 million in 2014 and timing losses of 24 million in 2015 which will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle 

included in the 149 million of favorable realized results for the year ended december 31 2014 in energy tradings gas strategies is 65 million of timing related losses recognized in 2013 that reversed as the underlying contracts were settled included in the 211 million of favorable unrealized results for the year ended december 31 2014 in energy tradings gas strategies is 102 million of timing related gains which will reverse in future periods and the absence of 89 million of timing related losses in 2013 

outlook —  in the nearterm energy trading expects market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result dte energy will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets energy tradings strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments the 2015   net loss  of 48 million  represents an improvement  of 9 million  from the 2014   net loss  of 57 million  due primarily to 2014 investment impairments and lower deferred tax expense related to the impact of new york state income tax reform enacted in march 2014 partially offset by higher interest expense the 2014   net loss  of 57 million  represents an increase  of 13 million  from the 2013   net loss  of 44 million  due primarily to increased impairments of investments and increased deferred tax expense related to new york state income tax reform enacted in march 2014 

see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  income taxes  

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

dte energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities to grow the nonutility businesses to retire and pay interest on longterm debt and to pay dividends dte energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements dte energy expects that cash from operations in 2016  will be approximately 18 billion  or approximately 100 million  lower than 2015  due primarily to higher working capital requirements dte energy anticipates base level utility capital investments environmental renewable and energy optimization expenditures expenditures for nonutility businesses and contributions to equity method investees in 2016  of approximately 27 billion  dte energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

 37 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of dte energys operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric retail access regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

cash from operations increased   72 million  in 2015  the increase  in operating cash flows reflects a decrease in cash expenditures for working capital items partially offset by lower net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items the decreases in depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes are partially offset by the increase in asset gains losses and impairments which is primarily due to dte energys closure of the shenango coke battery plant in 2015 see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  acquisitions and exit activities  

cash from operations decreased   315 million  in 2014  the reduction  in operating cash flows reflects an increase in cash expenditures for working capital items partially offset by higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes 

the change in working capital items in 2015  primarily related to increases in regulatory assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities accounts receivable net and inventories partially offset by decreases in accrued pension liability accrued postretirement liability and accounts payable the change in working capital items in 2014  primarily related to fuel inventories derivative assets and liabilities and regulatory assets and liabilities partially offset by the change in accounts receivable net accounts payable and pension and other postretirement liabilities 

 38 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions in any given year dte energy looks to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve the electric generation the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within the nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth dte energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis dte energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria for new business lines dte energy initially invests based on research and analysis dte energy starts with a limited investment evaluates the results and either expands or exits the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of dte energy with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings 

net cash used for  investing activities increased   144 million  in 2015  due primarily to dte energys 241 million  acquisition in january this is partially offset by the increase in restricted cash for debt redemption as this activity primarily relates to securitization bonds that were fully redeemed in march 2015 

net cash used for  investing activities increased   154 million  in 2014  due primarily to increased capital expenditures by the utility businesses partially offset by decreased capital expenditures by the nonutility business and increased proceeds from sale of assets 

cash from used for financing activities 

dte energy relies on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations 

dte energys strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity dte energy continually evaluates its leverage target which is currently 50 to 53 to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from  financing activities increased   65 million  in 2015  the increase  is primarily attributable to decreased redemptions of longterm debt which is offset by decreases in issuances of longterm debt shortterm borrowings and repurchase of common stock 

net cash from  financing activities increased   478 million  in 2014  the increase  is primarily attributable to increases in shortterm borrowings and issuances of longterm debt partially offset by increased redemptions of longterm debt repurchases of common stock and increased dividends on common stock 

outlook 

dte energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from the utility and nonutility businesses growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

dte energy may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future dte energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of longterm capital projects 

dte energy has approximately 500 million  in longterm debt maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 15 billion  of available liquidity at december 31 2015  consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

 39 

dte energy expects to issue approximately 100 million of common stock in 2016 through its pension and other employee benefit plans 

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making 2016  contributions to the pension plans of up to 180 million  and up to 20 million  to the other postretirement benefit plans the planned contributions will be made in cash or a combination of cash and dte energy common stock 

various subsidiaries of dte energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that dte energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as “hard triggers” state specific circumstances under which dte energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as “soft triggers” are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which dte energy may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2015  dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letter of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was approximately 412 million  

dte energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of dte energys businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows

credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy dte electric and dte gas credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets dte energy dte electric and dte gas management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte energy dte electric and dte gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of dte energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that dte energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade dte energy dte electric and dte gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade the nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy dte electric and dte gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect dte energy dte electric and dte gas ability to comply with existing debt covenants while dte energy dte electric and dte gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

in february 2016 based on dte energys strong and predictable earnings and cash flow fitch upgraded dte energys unsecured debt rating from bbb to bbb and upgraded dte electrics secured debt rating from a to a 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the registrants consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements the registrants management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of the registrants businesses are subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the registrants businesses the registrants management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  

derivatives 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

 41 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the registrants management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2015  and 2014  the registrants management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values the registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the registrants estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices the registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts see the sensitivity analysis in item 7a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 11 and 12  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the registrants each establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and their respective managements assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for dte electric and dte gas is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances the registrants believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of dte energys reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations dte energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test dte energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test dte energy estimates the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance dte energy also employs marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

dte energy performs an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests dte energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while dte energy believes the assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact dte energys earnings 

 42 

dte energy performed its annual impairment test as of october 1 2015  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed as part of the annual impairment test dte energy also compared the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to its overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity 

the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the october 1 2015  valuation date 



 

 dte energy identified a goodwill impairment test trigger for its power and industrial projects reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2015 the trigger related to the closure of the shenango coke battery plant and the testing for recoverability of the longlived asset for another coke battery in response to a sharp downturn in the north american steel industry accordingly dte energy performed an interim goodwill impairment test for the power and industrial projects reporting unit as of november 30 2015 using updated cash flow and discount rate assumptions as compared to the annual test the interim valuation was negatively impacted by the projected lower value expected to be realized from dte energys steelrelated projects during 2016 and a higher discount rate the fair value reduction percentage decreased from 23 to 16 the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill therefore the reporting unit passed step 1 of the impairment test no other triggers were identified during the fourth quarter of 2015 in 2016 dte energy will continue to monitor the north american steel industry for other events that may indicate the fair value of goodwill is below the carrying value of the power and industrial projects reporting unit 

longlived assets 

the registrants evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require the registrants to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact their earnings 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 dte energy announced the closure of the shenango coke battery plant as a result of the closure longlived assets with a carrying value of 96 million  were fully impaired 

 43 

in connection with the closure of the shenango coke battery plant dte energy reviewed another coke battery asset for events and circumstances that indicate the longlived asset of approximately 108 million within the power and industrial projects reporting unit might be impaired however dte energy’s estimate of undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were expected to be recovered dte energy will continue to monitor the assumptions used in this analysis further deterioration of the steel industry could lead to a future impairment of the asset 

pension and other postretirement costs 

dte energy sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the registrants the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required dte energy considers historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

dte energy had pension costs of 221 million  in 2015  179 million  in 2014  and 228 million  in 2013  other postretirement benefit credits were 99 million  in 2015  123 million  in 2014  and 42 million  in 2013  pension and other postretirement benefit credits for 2015  are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 775  for the pension plans and 800  for the other postretirement benefit plans in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumptions dte energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets dte energys 2016  expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47  in equity markets 25  in fixed income markets including long duration bonds and 28  invested in other assets dte energys 2016  expected longterm rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 41  in equity markets 25  in fixed income markets and 34  invested in other assets because of market volatility dte energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions and financial market risk considerations dte energy is maintaining its longterm rate of return assumptions for the pension plans and the other postretirement plans at 775  and 800  respectively for 2016  dte energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rate of return on the plan assets for 2016  given its investment strategy dte energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions including its expected rate of return at least annually 

dte energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for the pension plans dte energy uses a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2015  detracted from dte energys investment performance resulting in unrecognized net losses as of december 31 2015  dte energy had 175 million  of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets related to investment performance in 2015  and 2014  for the other postretirement benefit plans dte energy uses fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that dte energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans the discount rate determined on this basis was 450  for the pension plans and 450  for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2015  compared to 412  for the pension plans and 410  for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2014  

 44 

the mortality assumptions that dte energy used to determine the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2015  were updated to incorporate the mp2015 generational projection scale issued by the society of actuaries in 2015 the mortality assumptions used at december 31 2015  are the rp2014 mortality table with variations by type of plan and participant’s union status and employment status projected back to 2006 using scale mp2014 and projected forward using scale mp2015 

dte energy estimates that the 2016  total pension costs will approximate 175 million  compared to 221 million  in 2015  primarily due to higher discount rates and changes to the mortality tables partially offset by less than expected 2015  returns the 2016  other postretirement benefit credit will approximate 110 million  compared to 99 million  in 2015  due to higher discount rate changes to the mortality tables and favorable retiree medical utilization trends partially offset by lower than expected financial market returns 

the health care trend rates for dte energy assume 625  for pre65 participants and 675  for post65 participants for 2016  trending down to 450  for both pre65 and post65 participants in 2027  

future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs credits will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2015  pension costs by approximately 38 million  lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2015  pension costs by approximately 21 million  lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2015  other postretirement credit by approximately 15 million  lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have decreased the 2015  other postretirement credit by approximately 27 million  lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the other postretirement credit for 2015  by approximately 6 million  

the value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 54 billion  at december 31 2015  and 55 billion  at december 31 2014  at december 31 2015  dte energys qualified pension plans were underfunded by 1 billion  and its other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 230 million  the 2015  funding levels generally increased due to increased discount rates a change in the mortality tables and plan sponsor contributions partially offset by lower than expected financial market returns 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets dte energy made contributions to its qualified pension plans of 177 million  in 2015  and 188 million  in 2014  at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions dte energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to 180 million  in 2016  and up to 960 million  over the next five years dte energy made other postretirement benefit plan contributions of 199 million  in 2015  and 24 million  in 2014  dte energy is required by orders issued by the mpsc to make other postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in the utilities base rates as a result dte energy anticipates making up to 20 million  of contributions to its other postretirement plans in 2016  and over the next five years the planned contributions will be made in cash or a combination of cash and dte energy common stock

legal reserves 

the registrants are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon the registrants management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the registrants 

 45 

accounting for tax obligations 

the registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold the registrants also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken the registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the consolidated financial statements the registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2015  and 2014  are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the registrants consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts dte energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power natural gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items dte energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation contracts renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 11 and 12  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  respectively 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in the registrants reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the registrants manage their mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 11  to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

the electric and gas businesses have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of coal natural gas uranium and electricity however the registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales and transportation services revenue at the gas segment the gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the registrants are exposed to shortterm cash flows or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

dte energys gas storage and pipelines business segment has exposure to natural gas price fluctuations which impact the pricing for natural gas storage and transportation dte energy manages its exposure through the use of short medium and longterm storage and transportation contracts 

dte energys power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity natural gas and coal product price risk dte energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of longterm contracts 

dte energys energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas coal crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

 47 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

certain of the registrants customers and suppliers have filed for bankruptcy protection under the us bankruptcy code the registrants regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and suppliers and their purchase and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts the registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss 

trading activities 

dte energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations dte energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties 

the following table displays the credit quality of dte energys trading counterparties as of december 31 2015  



 

 other 

the registrants engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade the registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt in order to manage interest costs dte energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements dte energys exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2015  dte energy had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately 52  

 48 

foreign currency exchange risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit dte energys exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations dte energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through june 2020  

summary of sensitivity analyses 

the registrants performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values of commodity contracts longterm debt obligations and foreign currency exchange forward contracts the commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange risk listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at december 31 2015  and 2014  by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values 

the results of the sensitivity analysis calculations as of december 31 2015  and 2014

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 303 million tons of lowsulfur western coal and approximately 35 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2015 to 2017 all of these contracts have pricing schedules we have approximately 91 of our 2015 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have our expected western coal rail requirements under contract through 2018 all of our expected eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2016 contracts covering expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities are currently being negotiated 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages 

properties 

dte electric owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of dte electrics property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2014  are shown in the following table the companys renewable energy generation principally wind turbines is described below

in 2008 a renewable portfolio standard was established for michigan electric providers targeting 10 of electricity sold to retail customers from renewable energy by 2015 dte electric had approximately 1000 mw of owned or contracted renewable energy generation principally wind turbines located in gratiot tuscola huron and sanilac counties in michigan at december 31 2014  approximately 900 mw was in commercial operation at december 31 2014  dte electric expects to meet the 10 renewable portfolio standard in 2015 

dte electric expects to retire trenton channel unit 7 109 mw in april 2016 over the next fifteen years dte electric expects to retire additional coalfired generation and to increase the proportion of its generation mix attributable to natural gasfired generation and renewables in january 2015 dte electric closed on the acquisition of a 732 mw simplecycle natural gas facility in carson city michigan montcalm county see note 22  subsequent event of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

dte electric owns and operates 675 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 32867000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 432900 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 23359000 kva 

circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2014  



there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between dte electric and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission an unrelated company and connect to neighboring energy companies 

regulation 

dte electrics business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte electrics mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates dte electric with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of dte electrics nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health

strategy and competition 

our electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of our customers in a cost effective manner with potential capacity constraints in our miso region there will be increased dependency on our generation to provide reliable service and price stability for our customers this generation will require a large investment driven by our aging coal fleet along with increased environmental regulations 

our distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe cost effective and reliable manner to our customers we seek to increase operational efficiencies to increase our customer satisfaction at an affordable rate 

the electric customer choice program in michigan gives our electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers subject to limits customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total retail access related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on our financial performance and full service customer rates we expect that in 2015  customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

gas 

description 

our gas segment consists principally of dte gas which is a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 12 million  residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

revenue by service 



  8 

 our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in average customer usage are minimized by the rdm 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas segment 

natural gas supply 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 25 bcf with approximately 67 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2014  peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpsc approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2017 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions our primary longterm transportation supply contracts are as follows 



properties 

we own distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1162000 service pipelines and approximately 1313000 active meters we own approximately 2000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

we own storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 141 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties 

most of our distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by us through easements permits or licenses substantially all of dte gass property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 16  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report  capital and operating leases

regulation 

dte gass business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte gass mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments dte gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff 

dte gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the fercs jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by dte gas in interstate markets ferc granted dte gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates dte gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc 

we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 8 and 17  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  and  commitments and contingencies  

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte gas’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte gas’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory we also partner with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers changes in the level of funding provided to our lowincome customers will affect the level of uncollectible expense 

strategy and competition 

our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas services in michigan we expect future sales volumes to decline due to reduced natural gas usage by customers due to more efficient furnaces and appliances and an increased emphasis on conservation of energy usage we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

our extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled us to market our storage and transportation services for gas producers marketers distribution companies enduser customers and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to dte gass customers as well as sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

power and industrial projects 

description 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity from renewable energy projects this business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries as follows 

steel and petroleum coke we produce metallurgical coke from two coke batteries with a capacity of 14 million tons per year we have an investment in a third coke battery with a capacity of 12 million tons per year we also provide pulverized coal and petroleum coke to the steel pulp and paper and other industries 

onsite energy we provide power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply to industrial customers we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the automotive airport chemical and other industries 

wholesale power and renewables we hold ownership interests in and operate five renewable generating plants with a capacity of 228 mws the electric output is sold under long term power purchase agreements we also develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy in addition to providing environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

reduced emissions fuel  we own and operate nine ref facilities our facilities blend a proprietary additive with coal used in coalfired power plants resulting in reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury qualifying facilities are eligible to generate tax credits for ten years upon achieving certain criteria the value of a tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor published by the irs the value of the tax credit is reduced if the reference price of coal exceeds certain thresholds the economic benefit of the ref facilities is dependent upon the generation of production tax credits we placed in service five ref facilities in 2009 and an additional four ref facilities in 2011 to optimize income and cash flow from the ref operations we sold membership interests at two of the facilities in 2011 and at two additional facilities in 2013 we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites additionally we intend to relocate certain underutilized facilities to alternative coalfired power plants which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2015 and future years 

 12 

properties and other 

the following are significant properties operated by the power and industrial projects segment 





regulation 

certain electric generating facilities within power and industrial projects have marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power the facilities are subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules certain power and industrial projects are also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the epa us department of homeland security doe and various state utility commissions 

strategy and competition 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel onsite energy renewable power and ref businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services our operations are dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on the power and industrial projects business 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment new and pending legislation the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our related businesses as we expand as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

 13 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory contracts for pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the segment’s strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the cftc us department of homeland security and doe 

strategy and competition 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric and gas marketers financial institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the energy trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating the company believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities we monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that our commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk 

corporate and other

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



air   dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide with further emission controls planned for reductions of mercury and other emissions these rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years 

the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa is proposing performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing electric generating units egus the epa plans to issue a final standard for both new and existing sources by july 2015 the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on the company since the company has no plans to build new coalfired generation it is not possible to determine the potential impact of future regulations on existing sources at this time pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

water   the epa finalized regulations on cooling water intake in august 2014 dte electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes the epa has also issued proposed steam electric effluent guidelines these rules are expected to require additional wastewater discharge controls 

contaminated and other sites   prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites gas segment owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites the company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse effect on the companys operations 

we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the companys financial position and cash flows and the rates we charge our customers 

 15 

in december 2014 the epa released a prepublication version of a rule to regulate coal ash this rule is based on the continued listing of ash as a nonhazardous waste and relies on various selfimplementation design and performance standards the rule is still being evaluated and it is not possible to quantify its impact at this time dte electric owns and operates three permitted engineered ash storage facilities to dispose of fly ash from coal fired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants 

see notes 8 and 17  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  and  commitments and contingencies  and management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report 

employees 

we had approximately 10000 employees as of december 31 2014  of which approximately 4900  were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for the company’s represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017 




 item 1a   risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energys utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations our utilities typically selfimplement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with michigan law however if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the selfimplementation period we must refund the difference with interest our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business if we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates our regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers we cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan in 2008 have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access related migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes we are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity 

 the miso regional energy market including the state of michigan is expected to face capacity constraints beginning in 2016 due primarily to the retirement of coalfired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements significant investment in new natural gasfired generation and renewables will be required under the current regulatory structure retail access customers do not fund capacity costs potentially impacting electric supply reliability and utility customer affordability 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers 

 16 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in our generation fleet and gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented the operations of our fossilfuel generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of our gas transportation businesses 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance in addition while we have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of our nuclear generating plant there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers our nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and gas and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses we have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in our utility and nonutility businesses but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for our nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact our financial results  we are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of our facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses 

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact our liquidity 

 17 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations our costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from our utility customers the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

our ability to access capital markets is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses and to fund capital investments turmoil in credit markets may constrain our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2018 but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities and nonutility businesses and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to ris k we are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits construction disputes and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses 

our nonutility businesses may not perform to our expectations  we rely on our nonutility operations for an increasing portion of our earnings if our current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks we routinely have speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines we set resulting from the management of our business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position we manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources we generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery reduced emission fuel renewable energy generation and gas production operations all production tax credits taken after 2012 are subject to audit by the irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows 

 18 

weather significantly affects operations at both utilities deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow at dte electric ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business we are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy we expect to comply with the existing state legislation but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation in addition there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources we cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers 

we are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage we cannot predict how these programs will impact our business and future operating results 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our utility and nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services we supply collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flow 

threats of terrorism or cyberattacks could affect our business we may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite our implementation of security measures all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes if our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition our generation plants gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products we have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers shareholders and employees our customers shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or dte energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

 19 

failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results in addition we have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact our operations 

a work interruption may adversely affect us  there are several bargaining units for the companys approximately 4900 represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017 a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

the companys businesses have safety risks the companys electric and gas distribution systems power plants gas infrastructure wind energy equipment and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury or property loss to employees customers or the public although we have insurance coverage for many potential incidents depending upon the nature and severity of any incident the company could experience financial loss damage to its reputation and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2014  operating revenues of approximately 123 billion  and approximately 280 billion  in assets we are the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan we operate three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes our financial results 



the increase  in 2014  income from continuing operations attributable to dte energy company is primarily due to higher earnings in the energy trading electric power and industrial projects and gas storage and pipelines segments the decrease  in 2013  income from continuing operations attributable to dte energy company is primarily due to lower earnings in the energy trading segment partially offset by higher earnings in the gas and power and industrial projects segments 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

our utilities growth will be driven by base infrastructure new generation and environmental compliance capital investments we are focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability we operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with our regulators 

we have significant investments in our nonutility businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage our assets skills and expertise and provide diversity in earnings and geography specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile we expect growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt we have an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage our exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

our utility businesses require significant base capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of asset bases including power generation plants distribution systems storage fields and other facilities and fleets dte electrics capital investments over the 20152019  period are estimated at 57 billion  for base infrastructure 14 billion  for new generation and 400 million  for environmental compliance dte electric plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings and renewable energy plan filings for capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

dte gass capital investments over the 20152019  period are estimated at 1 billion  for base infrastructure and 600 million  for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs in april 2013 the mpsc issued an order approving an infrastructure recovery mechanism for dte gas and authorized the recovery of the cost of service related to 77 million of annual investment in its gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs in november 2014 dte gas filed an application with the mpsc for approval of an increased infrastructure recovery mechanism surcharge to recover an additional 47 million of annual capital expenditures for its gas main renewal program dte gas plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings for base infrastructure capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

 24 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers 

dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules will lead to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide acid gases particulate matter and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements dte electric spent approximately 22 billion  through 2014  it is estimated that dte electric will make capital expenditures of approximately 100 million  in 2015  and up to approximately 30 million  of additional capital expenditures through 2019 based on current regulations 

as directed by a june 2013 presidential memorandum the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy among these actions the epa is proposing performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing electric generating units egus the new source performance standards for new egus were proposed in september 2013 and the standards for existing reconstructed and modified egus were proposed in june 2014 the epa plans to issue a final standard for both new and existing sources by july 2015 as described in the june 2013 presidential memorandum 

dte energy is an active participant in working with the epa and other stakeholders to shape the final performance standards for new and existing power plants the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on the company since the company has no plans to build new coalfired generation it is not possible to determine the potential impact of future regulations on existing sources at this time pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission credits from market sources higher costs of purchased power and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers as authorized by the mpsc 

increased costs for energy produced from traditional coalbased sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable natural gasfired generation andor nuclear sources from energy efficiency initiatives and from the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets which could provide new business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments a june 2014 us supreme court decision on the epa’s authority to regulate ghg emissions under permitting programs of the clean air act is expected to have little effect on dte energy since the supreme courts decision upholds the epa’s authority to regulate ghgs at sources that are already subject to permitting due to emissions of conventional pollutants in addition the supreme courts ruling does not affect the epa’s current proposed carbon performance standards at new or existing power plants at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on dte energy or its customers 

see note 17  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  commitments and contingencies  and items 1 and 2 business and properties for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

  25 

 we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments 



electric 

our electric segment consists principally of dte electric 

electric results are discussed below 



gross margin   increased  by 47 million  in 2014  and decreased   4 million  in 2013  revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statements of operations 

 26 

the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





 

 operation and maintenance expense   decreased   45 million  in 2014  and decreased   52 million  in 2013  the decrease in 2014  is primarily due to decreased employee benefit expenses of 68 million decreased distribution operations expenses of 36 million and decreased power plant generation expenses of 7 million partially offset by higher restoration and line clearance expenses of 19 million increased low income energy assistance of 17 million and increased energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 13 million in addition 2014 included 17 million of expenses related to the transition of pld customers to dte electrics distribution system effective july 1 2014 in may 2014 the mpsc approved a trm that provides for recovery of the deferred net incremental revenue requirement associated with the transition that is reflected in the depreciation and amortization line in the consolidated statement of operations the decrease in 2013  is primarily due to decreased employee benefit expenses of 90 million decreased power plant generation expenses of 14 million and decreased low income energy assistance of 12 million partially offset by increased restoration and line clearance expenses of 19 million increased corporate administrative expenses of 17 million increased uncollectible expenses of 11 million increased energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 8 million and increased distribution operations expenses of 8 million 

depreciation and amortization   expense   increased   31 million  in 2014  and increased   75 million  in 2013  the 2014  increase was due to 42 million of increased expense due to an increased depreciable base increased amortization of regulatory assets of 3 million primarily related to securitization partially offset by 14 million associated with the trm the 2013  increase was due to increased amortization of regulatory assets of 57 million primarily related to securitization and increased depreciation of 18 million due to an increased depreciable base 

other income and deductions   decreased   36 million  in 2014  and decreased   3 million  in 2013  the decrease in 2014  was primarily due to decreased interest expenses of 18 million and the 2013 contribution to the dte energy foundation of 18 million the decrease in 2013  was primarily due to 2012 one time expenses of 11 million related to michigan ballot proposals and increased investment earnings of 10 million offset by a contribution to the dte energy foundation of 18 million 

 27 

outlook   —  we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we expect that our planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and electric retail access we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

in may 2014 dte electric filed an application with the nrc requesting a renewal of the license for its fermi 2 nuclear power plant dte electric has requested a 20year extension of its original license due to expire in 2025 

in december 2014 dte electric filed a rate case with the mpsc requesting an increase in base rates of 370 million based on a projected twelve month period ending june 30 2016 

gas   

our gas segment consists principally of dte gas 

gas results are discussed below 



gross margin   increased   61 million  in 2014  and increased   85 million  in 2013  revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 



 28 



operation and maintenance   expense   increased   27 million  in 2014  and increased   44 million  in 2013  the increase in 2014  is primarily due to increased gas operations expenses of 32 million increased uncollectible expenses of 4 million and increased corporate administrative expenses of 3 million partially offset by decreased employee benefit expenses of 10 million and reduced energy optimization expenses of 2 million the increase in 2013  is primarily due to increased gas operations expenses of 24 million increased maintenance and repair costs of 14 million increased transmission costs of 14 million increased corporate administrative expenses of 8 million and increased uncollectible expenses of 5 million partially offset by decreased employee benefit expenses of 19 million and decreased energy optimization expenses of 3 million 

other income and deductions   increased   27 million  in 2014  and decreased   19 million  in 2013  the increase in 2014  is primarily due to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other charitable organizations in 2014 the decrease in 2013  is due to lack of a contribution to the dte energy foundation in 2013 partially offset by a 5 million contribution to low income energy assistance funds 

outlook —  we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we expect that our planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

gas storage and pipelines 

our gas storage and pipelines segment consists of our nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses 

gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 



operating revenues   increased   71 million  in 2014  and increased   36 million  in 2013  the increases were due primarily to increased volumes on the bluestone pipeline and additional segments placed in service in the susquehanna gathering system storage revenue also increased due to weather favorability in early 2014 partially offset by lower market rates 

operation and maintenance expense   increased   21 million  in 2014  and increased   6 million  in 2013  the increases were due primarily to increased activity on the bluestone and susquehanna projects and increased corporate overheads due to growth of this segment 

 29 

depreciation and amortization   expense   increased   11 million  in 2014  and increased   15 million  in 2013  the increases were due primarily to the growth of the bluestone and susquehanna projects 

other income and deductions   decreased   17 million  in 2014  and decreased   4 million  in 2013  the decreases were due to decreased earnings from a pipeline investment and increased intercompany interest expense the earnings from the pipeline investment were negatively impacted by a revenue deferral for depreciation collected in fercapproved tariff rates in excess of depreciation expense 

outlook —  our gas storage and pipelines business expects to maintain its steady growth by developing an asset portfolio with multiple growth platforms through investment in new projects and expansions we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other storage and pipeline projects at favorable prices the capacity expansion of bluestone lateral pipeline in susquehanna county pennsylvania and broome county new york is progressing as planned in 2014 we added a new compressor facility and 35 miles of 24inch pipeline loop expanding the system to 475 miles of pipe in service expansion activities over the next twelve months include a second compressor facility and approximately 6 miles of additional pipeline loop to accommodate increased shipper demand through our long term agreement with southwestern energy production company we believe bluestone lateral and susquehanna gathering system are strategically positioned for future growth of the marcellus shale 

progress continues on preliminary development activities on the proposed nexus pipeline a transportation path for natural gas from the utica shale in ohio to michigan and ontario during 2014 several producers signed agreements as shippers indicating their firm volume commitment subject to certain conditions customary in the pipeline industry we are planning to have a partnership interest in the nexus pipeline 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce ref and sell electricity from renewable energy projects 

power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



operating revenues   increased   339 million  in 2014  and increased   127 million  in 2013  the 2014  increase is primarily due to a 354 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects and a 32 million increase associated with the startup of a renewable power project partially offset by a 46 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business the 2013  increase is primarily due to a 161 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects and a 102 million increase due to the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter partially offset by a 75 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business and a 63 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business 

 30 

operation and maintenance   expense   increased   367 million  in 2014  and increased   126 million  in 2013  the 2014  increase is primarily due to a 365 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects a 23 million increase associated with the startup of a renewable power project and a 20 million increase due to higher volumes maintenance and general administrative expenses in the steel business partially offset by a 46 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business the 2013  increase is primarily due to a 173 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects and an 84 million increase due to the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter partially offset by a 67 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business and a 67 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business 

depreciation and amortization expense increased  by 5 million  in 2014  and increased  by 7 million  in 2013  the 2014  increase is primarily due to 4 million associated with the startup of a renewable power project the 2013  increase is primarily due to 10 million associated with the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter partially offset by a 3 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net   increased  by 8 million  in 2014  and decreased  by 1 million  in 2013  the 2014  increase was due primarily to a gain associated with a sale of an onsite project in 2014 and an asset impairment recorded in the prior year 

other income and deductions   decreased  by 7 million  in 2014  and increased   29 million  in 2013  due primarily to variations in volumes of refined coal produced at ref sites with investors and in 2014 lower equity earnings at various projects 

production tax credits   increased  by 44 million  in 2014  and increased   9 million  in 2013  primarily due to higher production volumes of refined coal that resulted in higher tax credits at ref projects 

outlook   —  the company has constructed and placed in service nine ref facilities including five facilities located at third party owned coalfired power plants the company has sold membership interests in four of the facilities we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites we intend to relocate an underutilized facility located at a dte electric site to an alternative coalfired power plant which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in future years 

we expect sustained production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2015 substantially all of the metallurgical coke margin is maintained under longterm contracts we have five renewable power generation facilities in operation our onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other energy projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and natural gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers 

 31 

energy trading results are discussed below 



operating revenues and fuel purchased power and gas  were impacted by an increase in gas volumes and prices primarily in our gas structured strategy for the year ended december 31 2014  

gross margin   increased   295 million  in 2014  and decreased   109 million  in 2013  the overall increase in gross margin in 2014  was primarily due to timing from mtm adjustments on certain transactions in our gas structured strategy 

the increase in gross margin in 2014  represents a 92 million increase in realized margins and a 203 million increase in unrealized margins the 92 million increase in realized margins is due to 149 million of favorable results primarily in our gas structured and gas transportation strategies offset by 57 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power full requirements gas full requirements and gas trading strategies the 203 million increase in unrealized margins is due to 211 million of favorable results primarily in our gas structured and gas full requirements strategies offset by 8 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power full requirements strategy 

the decrease in gross margin in 2013  represents a 1 million decrease in realized margins and a 108 million decrease in unrealized margins the 1 million decrease in realized margins is due to 40 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power trading power full requirements and gas transportation strategies offset by 39 million of favorable results primarily in our gas and coal trading and gas structured strategies the 108 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to 123 million of unfavorable results primarily in our gas structured gas trading and gas transportation strategies offset by 15 million of favorable results primarily in our power full requirements strategy 

natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future andor natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related nonderivative pipeline transportation contract these gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are markedtomarket without revaluing the related nonderivative contracts during the fourth quarter of 2014 we saw significant decreases in gas prices and in the fourth quarter of 2013 significant increases in gas prices which led to the volatility in the accounting earnings due to the physical component being markedtomarket without an offsetting mark on the transportation component included in the 149 million of favorable realized results for the year ended december 31 2014 in our gas strategies is 65 million of timing related losses recognized in 2013 that reversed as the underlying contracts were settled included in the 211 million of favorable unrealized results for the year ended december 31 2014 in our gas strategies is 102 million of timing related gains which will reverse in future periods and the absence of 89 million of timing related losses in 2013 we anticipate that approximately 50 million of unrealized gains will reverse during 2015 as the underlying contracts settle 

outlook —  in the nearterm we expect market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations 

 32 

the energy trading portfolio includes financial instruments physical commodity contracts and natural gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generation capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

see also the “fair value” section that follows 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments the 2014   net loss  of 57 million  represented an increase  of 13 million  from the 2013   net loss  of 44 million  due primarily to increased impairments of investments and increased deferred tax expense related to new york state income tax reform enacted march 31 2014 the 2013   net loss  of 44 million  represented an improvement  of 3 million  from the 2012   net loss  of 47 million  due primarily to decreased impairments of investments

in december 2012 the company sold its 100 equity interest in its unconventional gas production business which consisted of gas and oil production assets in the western barnett and marble falls shale areas of texas see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  discontinued operations  

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and natural gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements we expect that cash from operations in 2015  will be approximately 17 billion  or approximately 100 million  lower than 2014  due primarily to decreased surcharge collections we anticipate base level utility capital investments environmental renewable and energy optimization expenditures expenditures for nonutility businesses and contributions to equity method investments in 2015  of approximately 26 billion  we plan to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria

cash from operating activities 

a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions changes in working capital and operating costs 

cash from operations decreased   315 million  in 2014  the reduction in operating cash flow reflects an increase in cash expenditures for working capital items partially offset by higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes 

cash from operations decreased   55 million  in 2013  the reduction in operating cash flow reflects lower cash generated from working capital items partially offset by higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes 

the change in working capital items in 2014  primarily related to fuel inventories derivative assets and liabilities and regulatory assets and liabilities partially offset by the change in accounts receivable net accounts payable and pension and other postretirement liabilities the change in working capital items in 2013  primarily related to fuel inventories derivative assets and liabilities and pension and other postretirement liabilities partially offset by the change in accounts receivable net

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within our nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth we look to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we initially invest based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

net cash used for investing activities increased   154 million  in 2014  due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility businesses partially offset by decreased capital expenditures by our nonutility business and increased proceeds from sale of assets 

net cash used for investing activities increased   137 million  in 2013  due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility businesses 

cash used for financing activities 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 to 53 to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash from financing activities increased   478 million  in 2014  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in shortterm borrowings and issuances of longterm debt partially offset by increased redemptions of longterm debt repurchases of common stock and increased dividends on common stock 

net cash used for financing activities decreased   182 million  in 2013  the decrease was primarily attributable to higher issuances of longterm debt partially offset by higher redemptions of longterm debt 

outlook 

we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and nonutility businesses we expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined our nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in our gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

we may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects 

we have approximately 300 million  in longterm debt maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the principal amount of the securitization debt is funded through a surcharge payable by dte electric’s customers the repayment of the other debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 15 billion  of available liquidity at december 31 2014  consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

 35 

we expect to issue equity of approximately 200 million in 2015 through our dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans 

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making 2015  contributions to the pension plans of up to 180 million  and up to 200 million  to the other postretirement benefit plans the planned contributions will be made in cash or a combination of cash and dte energy common stock 

various subsidiaries of the company have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that the company post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these provisions known as “hard triggers” state specific circumstances under which the company can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade while other provisions known as “soft triggers” are not as specific for contracts with soft triggers it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties andor which the company may ultimately be required to post the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas power and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions as of december 31 2014  dte energys contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letter of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions was approximately  349 million  

we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows

credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities dte energy’s credit ratings affect our cost of capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade certain of these contracts for dte electric and dte gas contain similar provisions in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade our nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

 in january 2014 based on a favorable view of the us regulatory environment moodys upgraded dte energys unsecured debt rating from baa1 to a3 and upgraded the secured debt rating of dte electric and dte gas from a1 to aa3 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  regulatory matters  

derivatives and hedging activities 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

 37 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the company and our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2014  and 2013  management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices we perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of our forward contracts see sensitivity analysis in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein 

see notes 11 and 12  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and managements assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations we perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test we estimate the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance we also employ marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

we performed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2014  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed as part of the annual impairment test we also compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows 

 38 

as of october 1 2014  valuation date 



 

 we perform an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

longlived assets 

we evaluate the carrying value of our longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require us to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact our earnings 

pension and other postretirement costs 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the company the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required we consider historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

 39 

we had pension costs of 179 million in 2014  228 million in 2013  and 220 million in 2012  other postretirement benefit costs credit were 123 million in 2014  42 million in 2013  and 151 million in 2012  pension and other postretirement benefit costs credit for 2014  are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 775 for our pension plans and 8 for our other postretirement benefit plans in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumptions we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets our 2015  expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47 in equity markets 25 in fixed income markets and 28 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions and financial market risk considerations we are maintaining our longterm rate of return assumptions for our pension plans and our other postretirement plans at 775 and 8 respectively for 2015  we believe these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2015  given our investment strategy we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for our pension plans we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2014  contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2014  we had 78 million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets related to investment performance in 2014  2013  and 2012  for our other postretirement benefit plans we use fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased to 412 for the pension plans and 41 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2014  from 495 at december 31 2013  

the mortality assumptions that we used to determine the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2014 were updated to incorporate the rp2014 mortality table issued by the society of actuaries in 2014 with the mp2014 generational projection scale with variations by type of plan and participants union status and employment status 

we estimate that our 2015  total pension costs will approximate 218 million compared to 179 million in 2014  primarily due to lower discount rates and changes to the mortality tables partially offset by greater than expected 2014  returns our 2015  other postretirement benefit credit will approximate 98 million compared to 123 million in 2014  due to lower than expected returns lower discount rate and changes to the mortality tables partially offset by the continued impact of plan design changes and favorable retiree medical utilization trends our health care trend rate for pre65 participants assumes 75 for 2015  and 7 for 2016  and 2017  65 for 2018  6 in 2019  575 in 2020  55 in 2021  525 in 2022  5 in 2023  475 in 2024  and 45 in 2025  and beyond our health care trend rate for post65 participants assumes 65 for 2015  and 625 for 2016  and 2017  6 in 2018  575 in 2019  55 in 2020  525 in 2021 5 in 2022  475 in 2023  and 45 in 2024  and beyond future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs credit will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2014  pension costs by approximately 33 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2014  pension costs by approximately 18 million lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased our 2014  other postretirement credit by approximately 15 million lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have decreased our 2014  other postretirement credit by approximately 24 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our other postretirement credit for 2014  by approximately 7 million 

 40 

the value of our qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 55 billion at december 31 2014  and 52 billion at december 31 2013  at december 31 2014  our qualified pension plans were underfunded by 117 billion and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 517 million the 2014  funding levels generally declined due to decreased discount rates and a change in the mortality tables 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets we made contributions to our qualified pension plans of 188 million in 2014  and 277 million in 2013  at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making contributions to our qualified pension plans of up to 180 million in 2015  and up to 875 million over the next five years we made other postretirement benefit plan contributions of 24 million in 2014 and 264 million in 2013  we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make other postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in our utilities base rates as a result we anticipate making up to a 200 million contribution to our other postretirement plans in 2015  and subject to mpsc funding requirements up to 250 million over the next five years the planned contributions will be made in cash or a combination of cash and dte energy common stock 

see note 18  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  retirement benefits and trusteed assets  

legal reserves 

we are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us 

insured and uninsured risks 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure the maximum selfinsured retention for various risks is 10 million  for property damage 7 million  for general liability 9 million  for workers’ compensation and 7 million  for auto liability we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported ibnr liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate as of december 31 2014  this ibnr liability was approximately 32 million  

accounting for tax obligations 

we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold we also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2014  and 2013  are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power natural gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation contracts renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 11 and 12  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value  and  financial and other derivative instruments  

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in dte energy’s reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the company manages its mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the company records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the company has established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report  fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

the electric and gas businesses have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of coal natural gas uranium and electricity however the company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales and transportation services revenue at the gas segment gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the company is exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

our gas storage and pipelines business segment has exposure to natural gas price fluctuations which impact the pricing for natural gas storage and transportation the company manages its exposure through the use of short medium and longterm storage and transportation contracts 

our power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity and natural gas product price risk the company manages its exposures to commodity price risk through the use of longterm contracts 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas coal crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

the company purchases and sells electricity natural gas coal coke and other energy products from and to governmental entities and numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail financial and other industries certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under the us bankruptcy code the company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss the company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss 

other 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

trading activities 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties 

 43 

the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2014  



 

 interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2014  we had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately 46  excluding securitized debt 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we have entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through april 2019 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt obligations and foreign currency exchange forward contracts the commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange risk listed below principally relate to our energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2014  and 2013  by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values

electric 

description 

our electric segment consists principally of dte electric an electric utility engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 21 million customers in southeastern michigan dte electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdeq electricity is generated from our fossilfuel plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant a nuclear plant and our wind and other renewable assets and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to three major classes of customers residential commercial and industrial throughout southeastern michigan 

revenue by service

weather economic factors competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on dte electric 

fuel supply and purchased power 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 294 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2014 through 2016 and approximately 16 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered in 2014 all of these contracts have pricing schedules we have approximately 92 of our 2014 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have our expected western coal rail requirements under contract through 2018 all of our expected eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2016 our expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities are under contract through 2014 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages 

properties 

dte electric owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2013  are shown in the following table the companys renewable energy generation principally wind turbines is described below 

 

 

 6 

in 2008 a renewable portfolio standard was established for michigan electric providers targeting 10 of electricity sold to retail customers from renewable energy by 2015 dte electric had approximately 900 mw of owned or contracted renewable energy generation principally wind turbines located in gratiot tuscola huron and sanilac counties in michigan at december 31 2013 which is projected to represent approximately 96 of electricity that will be sold to retail customers in 2015 approximately 690 mw was in commercial operation at december 31 2013 dte electric expects to meet the 10 renewable portfolio standard with the commercial operation of an additional 210 mw in 2014 and 50 mw in 2015 

dte electric owns and operates 669 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33418000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 428600 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 23272000 kva 

circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2013 



there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between dte electric and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission an unrelated company and connect to neighboring energy companies 

regulation 

dte electrics business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte electrics mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates dte electric with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of dte electrics nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 3 10 11 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory we also partner with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers changes in the level of funding provided to our lowincome customers will affect the level of uncollectible expense 

strategy and competition 

we strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast michigan we can accomplish this goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable lowcost supplier of electricity to ensure generation and network reliability we continue to make capital investments in our generating plants and distribution system which will improve plant availability operating efficiencies and environmental compliance in areas that have a positive impact on reliability with the goal of high customer satisfaction 

our distribution operations focus on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service we seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

 7 

the electric customer choice program in michigan allows our electric customers to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers of generation services subject to limits customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential customer choice related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric customer choice on our financial performance and full service customer rates we expect that in 2014  customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

gas 

description 

our gas segment consists of dte gas and citizens dte gas is a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

revenue by service 



 

 

 

 

 8 

our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in average customer usage are minimized by the rdm effective with the self implementation of rates on november 1 2012 the rdm was terminated the dte gas partial rate case settlement agreement approved by the mpsc in december 2012 created a new rdm effective november 1 2013 which decouples weather normalized distribution revenue inside caps the caps are tied to expected customer conservation attributable to dte gass energy efficiency program or 1125 in year one increasing to 225 for the second and future periods 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas segment 

natural gas supply 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 25 bcf with approximately 67 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2013 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpsc approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2016 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions our primary longterm transportation supply contracts are as follows 



properties 

we own distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1162000 service pipelines and approximately 1311000 active meters we own approximately 2000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

we own storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 139 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties 

most of our distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by us through easements permits or licenses substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report

regulation 

dte gass business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte gass mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments dte gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff 

dte gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the fercs jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by dte gas in interstate markets ferc granted dte gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates dte gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc 

we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 11 and 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte gas’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte gas’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory we also partner with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers changes in the level of funding provided to our lowincome customers will affect the level of uncollectible expense 

strategy and competition 

our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas services in michigan we expect future sales volumes to decline due to reduced natural gas usage by customers due to more efficient furnaces and appliances and an increased emphasis on conservation of energy usage we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

our extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled us to market 400 to 500 bcf annually for intermediate storage and transportation services for michigan gas producers marketers distribution companies and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to dte gass customers as well as sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three years prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing

power and industrial projects 

description 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects this business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries as follows 

steel and petroleum coke we produce metallurgical coke from two coke batteries with a capacity of 14 million tons per year we have an investment in a third coke battery with a capacity of 12 million tons per year we also provide pulverized coal and petroleum coke to the steel pulp and paper and other industries 

onsite energy we provide power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply to industrial customers we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the automotive airport chemical and other industries 

wholesale power and renewables we own and operate four biomassfired electric generating plants with a capacity of 183 mws we own a coalfired power plant currently undergoing conversion to biomass with an inservice date in 2014 the electric output is sold under long term power purchase agreements we also develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy in addition to providing environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

reduced emissions fuel ref  we own and operate nine ref facilities our facilities blend a proprietary additive with coal used in coalfired power plants resulting in reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide no and mercury hg qualifying facilities are eligible to generate tax credits for ten years upon achieving certain criteria the value of a tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor published by the internal revenue service the value of the tax credit is reduced if the reference price of coal exceeds certain thresholds the economic benefit of the ref facilities is dependent upon the generation of production tax credits we placed in service five ref facilities in 2009 and an additional four ref facilities in 2011 to optimize income and cash flow from the ref operations we sold membership interests at two of the facilities in 2011 and at two additional facilities in 2013 we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites additionally we intend to relocate certain underutilized facilities to alternative coalfired power plants which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2014 and future years   

 12 

properties and other 

the following are significant properties operated by the power and industrial projects segment 





regulation 

certain electric generating facilities within power and industrial projects have marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power the facilities are subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules certain power and industrial projects are also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel renewable power onsite energy landfill gas recovery and ref businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services our operations are dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on the power and industrial projects business 

 13 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment new and pending legislation the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our related businesses as we expand as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 

 

 

 

energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power gas and coal marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf under ferc asset management arrangements and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory contracts for pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the segment’s strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric gas and coal marketers financial institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the energy trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating the company believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities we monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that our commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk

corporate and other 

description 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



air   dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide with further emission controls planned for reductions of mercury and other emissions future rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years 

water   in response to an epa regulation dte electric is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes however the types of technologies are unknown at this time the epa is expected to finalize regulations on cooling water intake in early 2014 the epa has also issued proposed steam electric effluent guidelines when finalized these guidelines are expected to require additional wastewater discharge controls 

contaminated and other sites   prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as manufactured gas plant mgp sites gas segment owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites the company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for citizens approved by the city of adrian will prevent mgp environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations 

we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the companys financial position and cash flows and the rates we charge our customers 

the epa has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash which may result in a designation of coal ash as a hazardous waste the epa could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time

see notes 11 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report 

employees 

we had approximately 9900 employees as of december 31 2013  of which approximately 4900 were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for the company’s represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017 




 item 1a    risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energys utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations our utilities typically selfimplement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with michigan law however if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the selfimplementation period we must refund the difference with interest our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various tracking and decoupling mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business if we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates our regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers we cannot predict what rates an mpsc order will authorize in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan in 2008 placed a 10 cap on the total potential electric customer choice related migration however even with the legislated 10 cap on participation  there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in our generation fleet and gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities including the retirement of certain generating plants based on these regulations additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented the operations of our fossilfuel generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

 16 

future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of our gas transportation businesses 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers our nonutility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and gas and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses we have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in our utility and nonutility businesses but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for our nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact our financial results  we are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of our facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses 

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact our liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations our costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from our utility customers the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows financial position or results of operations

our ability to access capital markets is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses turmoil in credit markets may constrain our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2018 but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities and nonutility businesses and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to ris k we are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits construction disputes and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses 

our nonutility businesses may not perform to our expectations  we rely on our nonutility operations for an increasing portion of our earnings if our current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements deviations in weather and other related risks we routinely have speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines we set resulting from the management of our business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position we manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources we generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery biomass fired electric generation reduced emission fuel renewable energy generation and gas production operations all production tax credits taken after 2011 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows 

weather significantly affects operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

 18 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business we are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy we expect to comply with the existing state legislation but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation in addition there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources we cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers 

we are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage we cannot predict how these programs will impact our business and future operating results 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our utility and nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services we supply collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flow 

threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our business we may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite our implementation of security measures all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes if our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition our generation plants gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products we have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers shareholders and employees our customers shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information and the united states regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or dte energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results 

a work interruption may adversely affect us   there are several bargaining units for the companys approximately 4900 represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017 a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

 19 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in july 2009 dte energy received a notice of violationfinding of violation novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five dte electric power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and operating permit requirements under the clean air act in june 2010 the epa issued a novfov making similar allegations related to a project and outage at unit 2 of the monroe power plant in march 2013 dte energy received a supplemental nov from the epa relating to the july 2009 novfov the supplemental nov alleged additional violations relating to the new source review provisions under the clean air act among other things 

in august 2010 the us department of justice at the request of the epa brought a civil suit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against dte energy and dte electric related to the june 2010 novfov and the outage work performed at unit 2 of the monroe power plant but not relating to the july 2009 novfov among other relief the epa requested the court to require dte electric to install and operate the best available control technology at unit 2 of the monroe power plant further the epa requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require dte electric to i begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the monroe unit 2 modification and ii offset the pollution from monroe unit 2 through emissions reductions from dte electrics fleet of coalfired power plants until the new control equipment is operating on august 23 2011 the us district court judge granted dte energys motion for summary judgment in the civil case dismissing the case and entering judgment in favor of dte energy and dte electric on october 20 2011 the epa caused to be filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit on march 28 2013 the court of appeals remanded the case to the us district court for review of the procedural component of the new source review notification requirements on september 3 2013 the epa caused to be filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint regarding the june 2010 novfov adding additional claims related to outage work performed at the trenton channel and belle river power plants as well as additional claims related to work performed at the monroe power plant in addition the sierra club caused to be filed a motion to add a claim regarding the river rouge power plant the epa and sierra club motions are currently pending with the us district court judge 

dte energy and dte electric believe that the plants identified by the epa and the sierra club including unit 2 of the monroe power plant have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations depending upon the outcome of discussions with the epa regarding the two novsfovs dte electric could be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines the company cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution 

in march 2013 the sierra club filed suit against dte energy and dte electric alleging violations of the clean air act at four of dte electrics coalfired power plants the plaintiffs allege 1499 6minute periods of excess opacity of air emissions from 20072012 at those facilities the suit asks that the court enjoin dte energy and dte electric from operating the power plants except in complete compliance with applicable laws and permit requirements pay civil penalties conduct beneficial environmental mitigation projects pay attorney fees and require the installation of any necessary pollution controls or to convert andor operate the plants boilers on natural gas to avoid additional violations and to offset historic unlawful emissions in december 2013 a us district court judge issued an order dismissing without prejudice the plaintiffs complaint allowing them to file an amended complaint by january 17 2014 the order dismissing the complaint resulted from a considerable number of plaintiffs claims being time barred based on the statute of limitations on january 17 2014 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint for the period january 13 2008  june 30 2012 reducing the total number of 6minute periods from 1499 to 1139 dte energy and dte electric plan to file an answer to the amended complaint in the first quarter of 2014 the resolution of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on the companys operations or financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2013  operating revenues of approximately 97 billion and approximately 26 billion in assets we are the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout michigan we operate three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes our financial results 



the decrease in 2013 income from continuing operations is primarily due to lower earnings in the energy trading segment partially offset by higher earnings in the gas and power and industrial projects segments the decrease in 2012 income from continuing operations is principally driven by an income tax benefit of 87 million in the corporate and other segment related to the enactment of the mcit in the second quarter of 2011 and lower results in the energy trading segment partially offset by improved results in the electric segment 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

our utilities growth will be driven by environmental and renewable investments in addition to base infrastructure investments we are focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability we operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with our regulators 

we have significant investments in our nonutility businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing meaningful lowrisk growth opportunities that leverage our assets skills and expertise and provide diversity in earnings and geography specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile we expect growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows issuance of debt and issuance of equity through our dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans we have an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage our exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

our utility businesses require significant base capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of asset bases including power generation plants distribution systems storage fields and other facilities and fleets dte electrics capital investments over the 20142018 period are estimated at 56 billion for base infrastructure 700 million for mandated environmental compliance requirements and 400 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency expenditures dte electric plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings and renewable energy plan filings for capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

dte gass capital investments over the 20142018 period are estimated at 700 million for base infrastructure and 500 million for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs in april 2013 the mpsc issued an order approving an infrastructure recovery mechanism irm and authorized the recovery of the cost of service related to 77 million of annual investment in its gas main renewal and meter move out and pipeline integrity programs dte gas plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings for base infrastructure capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment 

 25 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers 

dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution these rules will lead to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide acid gases particulate matter and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements dte electric has spent approximately 20 billion through 2013 it is estimated that dte electric will make capital expenditures of approximately 280 million in 2014 and up to approximately 12 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2021 based on current regulations 

climate regulation andor legislation has been proposed and discussed within the us congress and the epa the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs epa regulation of ghgs requires the best available control technology bact for new major sources or modifications to existing major sources that cause significant increases in ghg emissions in june 2012 the epa proposed new source performance standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new fossilfueled power plants these new source performance standards were reproposed on september 20 2013 under a presidential directive issued on june 25 2013 under the same presidential directive the epa is expected to propose performance standards for carbon dioxide emissions from existing and modified plants by june 1 2014 and issue final standards by june 1 2015 dte energy will be an active participant in working with the epa and other stakeholders to shape the final performance standards for new and existing power plants the standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on the company it is not possible to determine the potential impact of future regulations on existing sources at this time pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers per mpsc protocols increased costs for energy produced from traditional coal based sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable andor nuclear sources from energy efficiency initiatives and from the potential development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets which could provide new business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments at the present time it is not possible to quantify the financial implication of these climate related legislative or regulatory initiatives on dte energy or its customers 

see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and items 1 and 2 business and properties for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  26 

 

 

we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments 



electric 

our electric segment consists principally of dte electric 

electric results are discussed below 



gross margin  decreased by 4 million in 2013  and increased 97 million in 2012  revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statements of operations 

 27 

the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 



 

 

operation and maintenance  expense decreased 52 million in 2013  and increased 59 million in 2012  the decrease in 2013  is primarily due to lower employee benefit expenses of 90 million lower power plant generation expenses of 14 million and reduced low income energy assistance of 12 million partially offset by higher restoration and line clearance expenses of 19 million higher corporate administrative expenses of 17 million increased uncollectible expenses of 11 million higher energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 8 million and increased distribution operations expenses of 8 million the increase in 2012 is primarily due to higher employee benefit expenses of 53 million increased energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 17 million higher power plant generation expenses of 12 million increased distribution operations expenses of 4 million and higher expenses for low income energy assistance of 4 million partially offset by reduced restoration and line clearance expenses of 22 million and reduced uncollectible expenses of 9 million 

depreciation and amortization  expense increased 75 million in 2013 and 9 million in 2012 the 2013 increase was due to higher amortization of regulatory assets of 57 million primarily related to securitization and increased depreciation of 18 million due to a higher depreciable base the 2012 increase was due to higher amortization of regulatory assets of 43 million primarily related to securitization partially offset by the net effect of 34 million of lower depreciation rates on a higher depreciable base 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net increased 1 million in 2013 and increased 15 million in 2012 the 2012 increase was primarily due to a 2011 accrual of 19 million resulting from managements revisions of the timing and estimate of cash flows for the decommissioning of fermi 1 partially offset by a 2011 revision of 6 million in the timing and estimate of cash flows for the fermi 1 asbestos removal obligation and other items 

other income and deductions  were lower by 3 million in 2013 and by 37 million in 2012 the decrease in 2013 was primarily due to 2012 one time expenses of 11 million related to michigan ballot proposals and higher 2013 investment earnings of 10 million offset by the 2013 contribution to the dte energy foundation of 18 million the decrease in 2012 was due primarily to the 2011 contribution to the dte energy foundation of 21 million and lower interest expense of 17 million 

 28 

income tax  expense decreased 28 million in 2013 and increased 15 million in 2012 the variances were impacted by variations in pretax income and higher production tax credits 

outlook   —  we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we expect that our planned significant environmental expenditures will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and electric customer choice we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

in june 2013 the city of detroit announced a transition of its public lighting departments customers to the dte electric distribution system over a five to seven year system conversion period see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

gas   

our gas segment consists of dte gas and citizens 

gas results are discussed below 



gross margin  increased 85 million in 2013  and increased 4 million in 2012  revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statements of operations 

the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 



 29 



operation and maintenance  expense increased 44 million in 2013 and decreased 9 million in 2012  the increase in 2013 is primarily due to higher gas operations expenses of 24 million higher maintenance and repair costs of 14 million higher transmission costs of 14 million higher corporate administrative expenses of 8 million and increased uncollectible expenses of 5 million partially offset by lower employee benefit expenses of 19 million and reduced energy optimization expenses of 3 million the decrease in 2012 is primarily due to reduced uncollectible expenses of 9 million lower legal liability expenses of 4 million and lower customer service expenses of 3 million partially offset by increased energy optimization expenses of 6 million and higher employee benefit expenses of 3 million 

other income and deductions  were lower by 19 million in 2013 and higher by 15 million in 2012 the decrease in 2013 is due to lack of a contribution to the dte energy foundation in 2013 partially offset by a 5 million contribution to low income energy assistance funds the increase in 2012 was due primarily to the contribution to the dte energy foundation of 21 million partially offset by lower interest expenses of 5 million 

outlook —  we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we expect that our planned significant infrastructure capital expenditures will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings benefit plan design changes and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

gas storage and pipelines 

our gas storage and pipelines segment consists of our nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses 

gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 

net income attributable to dte energy increased 9 million and 4 million in 2013  and 2012  respectively operating revenues increased 36 million and depreciation expense increased 15 million in 2013 due to the operation of the bluestone and susquehanna projects the 2013 increase in operating revenues was partially offset by lower storage revenue due to lower market rates the 2012  increase in net income was primarily driven by higher earnings from our pipeline equity investments 

 30 

outlook —  our gas storage and pipelines business expects to maintain its steady growth by developing an asset portfolio with multiple growth platforms through investment in new projects and expansions millennium pipeline completed its phase one expansion in 2013 and its phase two expansion is scheduled to be in service in 2014 additionally bluestone a 44mile lateral pipeline in susquehanna county pennsylvania and broome county new york is in service and volumes are increasing we plan to expand the capacity of the bluestone lateral by constructing additional compression facilities meter upgrades and other initiatives to accommodate increased shipper demand through our agreement with southwestern energy services company and affiliates we believe bluestone lateral and susquehanna gathering system are strategically positioned for future growth of the marcellus shale 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel ref and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects 

power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



operating revenues  increased 127 million in 2013 and increased 694 million in 2012 the 2013 increase is primarily due to a 161 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects of which 25 million represents affiliate transactions and a 102 million increase due to the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter partially offset by a 75 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business and a 63 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business the 2012 increase is primarily due to a 740 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects of which 554 million represents affiliate transactions and a 30 million increase due to the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter partially offset by a 44 million decrease primarily due to lower volumes associated with the steel business and a 28 million decrease in coal transportation and marketing services business 

operation and maintenance  expense increased 126 million in 2013 and increased 763 million in 2012 the 2013 increase is primarily due to a 173 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects of which 25 million represents affiliate transactions and an 84 million increase due to the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter partially offset by a 67 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business and a 67 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business the 2012 increase is primarily due to a 770 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects of which 562 million represents affiliate transactions a 25 million increase due to the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter and an 11 million customer settlement partially offset by a 20 million decrease primarily due to lower volumes associated with the steel business and a 26 million decrease in coal transportation and marketing services business 

  

depreciation and amortization expense   increased by 7 million in 2013 and increased by 5 million in 2012 the 2013 increase is primarily due to 10 million associated with the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter partially offset by a 3 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business the 2012 increase was primarily due to 4 million associated with the onsite energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter 

 31 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net  decreased by 1 million in 2013 and decreased by 7 million in 2012 the 2012 decrease was due primarily to a 3 million loss on the sale of assets associated with our coal transloading terminal and 3 million of impairments related to nonstrategic assets 

other income and deductions  were higher by 29 million in 2013 and 34 million in 2012 due primarily to income that is recognized when refined coal is produced and tax credits are generated 

production tax credits increased by 9 million in 2013 and 38 million in 2012 primarily due to tax credits earned from ref projects 

outlook   —  the company has constructed and placed in service nine ref facilities including four facilities located at third party owned coalfired power plants the company has sold membership interests in four of the facilities we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites additionally we intend to relocate two underutilized facilities located at dte electric sites to alternative coalfired power plants which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2014 and future years 

we expect sustained production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2014 substantially all of the metallurgical coke margin is maintained under longterm contracts we have four biomassfired power generation facilities in operation and we are converting an additional facility to be placed in service in 2014 our onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts we will begin construction on a new natural gasfired cogeneration facility and two landfill gas to energy projects during the year which are expected to be completed in 2014 we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other energy projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power natural gas and coal marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers 

energy trading results are discussed below 



gross margin  decreased 109 million in 2013 and decreased 66 million in 2012 the overall decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to timing from marktomarket adjustments on certain transactions in our gas structured strategy 

 32 

natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future andor natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related nonderivative pipeline transportation contract these gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are markedtomarket without revaluing the related nonderivative contracts during the fourth quarter of 2013 we saw significant increases in gas prices which led to the volatility in the accounting earnings due to the physical component being markedtomarket without an offsetting mark on the transportation component unrealized losses from gas structured transactions were 89 million in 2013 we anticipate that approximately 65 of the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse during the first quarter of 2014 as the underlying contracts are settled 

the decrease in gross margin in 2013 represents a 1 million decrease in realized margins and a 108 million decrease in unrealized margins the 1 million decrease in realized margins is due to 40 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power trading power full requirements and gas transportation strategies offset by 39 million of favorable results primarily in our gas and coal trading and gas structured strategies the 108 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to 123 million of unfavorable results primarily in our gas structured gas trading and gas transportation strategies offset by 15 million of favorable results primarily in our power full requirements strategy 

the decrease in gross margin in 2012 represents a 28 million decrease in realized margins and a 38 million decrease in unrealized margins the 28 million decrease in realized margins is due to 74 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power and gas trading and power full requirements services strategies offset by 46 million of favorable results primarily in our gas full requirements services gas structured and gas transportation strategies the 38 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to 58 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power and gas full requirements services power trading and gas structured and storage strategies offset by 20 million of favorable results primarily in our gas trading strategy 

outlook —  in the near term we expect market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations 

the energy trading portfolio includes financial instruments physical commodity contracts and natural gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generation capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf under ferc asset management arrangements and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

the 2013 net loss of 44 million represented an improvement of 3 million from the 2012 net loss of 47 million due primarily to lower impairments of investments 

the 2012 net loss of 47 million represented a decrease of 70 million from the 2011 net income of 23 million the decrease resulted primarily from a income tax benefit of 87 million related to the enactment of the mcit in the second quarter of 2011 and lower interest costs

discontinued operations 

unconventional gas production 

in december 2012 the company sold its 100 equity interest in its unconventional gas production business which consisted of gas and oil production assets in the western barnett and marble falls shale areas of texas see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and natural gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements in 2014 we expect that cash from operations will be 16 billion due to lower surcharge collections and higher cash contributions to employee benefit plans we anticipate base level utility capital investments environmental renewable and energy optimization expenditures and expenditures for nonutility businesses in 2014 of approximately 23 billion we plan to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and natural gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs 

 34 

cash from operations was lower by 55 million in 2013 the reduction in operating cash flow reflects lower cash generated from working capital items partially offset by higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes 

cash from operations was 201 million higher in 2012 the improvement in operating cash flow reflects higher cash generated from working capital items partially offset by lower net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items primarily depreciation depletion and amortization deferred income taxes loss on sale of nonutility business and asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net 

the change in working capital items in 2013 primarily related to fuel inventories derivative assets and liabilities and pension and other postretirement liabilities partially offset by the change in accounts receivable net the change in working capital items in 2012 primarily related to pension and other postretirement obligations and income taxes 

cash used for investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within our nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance expansion and growth we look to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we initially invest based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

net cash used for investing activities was higher by 137 million in 2013 due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility businesses 

net cash used for investing activities was higher by 209 million in 2012 due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility and nonutility businesses the 2012 increase includes higher capital expenditures for the bluestone pipeline project and the power and industrial projects acquisition of fourteen onsite energy projects partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the unconventional gas production business 

cash used for financing activities 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 to 52 to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash used for financing activities was 182 million lower in 2013 the decrease was primarily attributable to higher issuances of longterm debt partially offset by higher redemptions of longterm debt 

net cash used for financing activities was 2 million lower in 2012 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower redemptions of longterm debt offset by a reduction in shortterm borrowings 

 35 

outlook 

we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and nonutility businesses we expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined our nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in our gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

we may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects 

we have approximately 900 million in longterm debt maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the principal amount of the securitization debt is funded through a surcharge payable by dte electric’s customers the repayment of the other debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 16 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2013 consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making 2014 contributions to the pension plans of up to 345 million and up to 145 million to the other postretirement benefit plans 

various subsidiaries of the company have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade as of december 31 2013  the value of the transactions for which the company would have been exposed to collateral requests had dte energy’s credit rating been below investment grade on such date was approximately  406 million  in circumstances where an entity is downgraded below investment grade and collateral requests are made as a result the requesting parties often agree to accept less than the full amount of their exposure to the downgraded entity in addition the company maintains adequate credit facilities to meet this obligation should such an occurrence arise 

we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows

contractual obligations 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2013 



 

 

credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the company’s credit ratings affect our cost of capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade certain of these contracts for dte electric and dte gas contain similar provisions in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade our nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

 37 

 in january 2013 fitch raised the senior secured debt rating for dte gas from a to a and affirmed the senior unsecured debt rating for dte energy at bbb and senior secured debt rating for dte electric at a the upgrade reflects improved earnings and cash flows following recent rate case orders a constructive regulatory environment and strong credit metrics in february 2013 based on steady improvement in the financial profiles due in large part to a constructive legislative and regulatory environment moodys upgraded dte energys unsecured debt rating from baa2 to baa1 and upgraded the secured debt rating of dte electric and dte gas from a2 to a1 in august 2013 sp raised the credit outlook from stable to positive for dte energy dte electric and dte gas pointing to the companys improving business risk profile sp also revised its business risk profile to excellent in january 2014 based on a favorable view of the us regulatory environment moodys upgraded dte energys unsecured debt rating from baa1 to a3 and upgraded the secured debt rating of dte electric and dte gas from a1 to aa3 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

derivatives and hedging activities 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the company and our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2013  and 2012  management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices we perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of our forward contracts see sensitivity analysis in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 38 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and managements assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations we perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test we estimate the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance we also employ marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

we performed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2013 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed as part of the annual impairment test we also compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows 

as of october 1 2013 valuation date 



 



the energy trading reporting unit passed step 1 of the impairment test by a 15 margin a substantive increase in the market interest rate or disruptions in cash flows for the energy trading reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the foreseeable future for example holding all other variables constant a 2 increase in the discount rate would lower the fair value by approximately 49 million at the lower fair value the energy trading reporting unit would likely fail step 1 of the test potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill following the completion of the step 2 analysis 

 39 

we perform an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

longlived assets 

we evaluate the carrying value of our longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require us to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact our earnings 

pension and other postretirement costs 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the company the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required we consider historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

we had pension costs of 228 million in 2013 220 million in 2012 and 172 million in 2011 other postretirement benefits costs credit were 42 million in 2013 151 million in 2012 and 122 million in 2011 pension and other postretirement benefits costs for 2013 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 825 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumptions we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets our 2014 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47 in equity markets 25 in fixed income markets and 28 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions and financial market risk considerations we are changing our longterm rate of return assumptions for our pension plans and our other postretirement health and life plans from 825 for 2013 to 775 for our pension plans and to 8 for our other postretirement health and life plans for 2014 we believe these rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2014 given our investment strategy we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for our pension plans we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2013 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2013 we had 150 million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets related to investment performance in 2013 2012 and 2011 for our other postretirement benefit plans we use fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

 40 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis increased to 495 at december 31 2013 from 415 at december 31 2012 we estimate that our 2014 total pension costs will approximate 175 million compared to 228 million in 2013 primarily due to greater than expected 2013 returns a higher discount rate lower amortization of net actuarial losses and 2014 contributions our 2014 other postretirement benefit credit will approximate 120 million compared to 42 million in 2013 due to the continued impact of plan design changes favorable retiree medical utilization trends greater than expected returns a higher discount rate lower amortization of net actuarial losses and modestly lower assumed longterm retiree medical inflation our health care trend rate for pre65 participants assumes 75 for 2014 and 2015 7 for 2016 and 2017 65 in 2018 6 in 2019 575 in 2020 55 in 2021 525 in 2022 5 in 2023 475 in 2024 and 45 in 2025 and beyond our health care trend rate for post65 participants assumes 65 for 2014 and 2015 625 for 2016 and 2017 6 in 2018 575 in 2019 55 in 2020 525 in 2021 5 in 2022 475 in 2023 45 in 2024 and beyond future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2013 pension costs by approximately 32 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2013 pension costs by approximately 16 million lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2013 other postretirement costs by approximately 13 million lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have decreased our 2013 other postretirement credit by approximately 27 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our other postretirement credit for 2013 by approximately 8 million 

the value of our qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 52 billion at december 31 2013 and 44 billion at december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 our qualified pension plans were underfunded by 565 million and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 351 million the 2013 funding levels generally improved due to increased discount rates investment returns in excess of expected returns plan sponsor contributions and plan design changes for our other postretirement benefits plans in 2013 and 2012 

pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets we made contributions to our qualified pension plans of 277 million in 2013 and 229 million in 2012 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making contributions to our qualified pension plans of up to 345 million in 2014 and up to 10 billion over the next five years we made other postretirement benefit plan contributions of 264 million and 140 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make other postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in our utilities base rates as a result we anticipate making up to a 145 million contribution to our other postretirement plans in 2014 and subject to mpsc funding requirements up to 165 million over the next five years the planned contributions will be made in cash dte energy common stock or a combination of cash and stock 

see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

legal reserves 

we are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us 

insured and uninsured risks 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure the maximum selfinsured retention for various risks is as follows property damage  10 million general liability  7 million workers’ compensation  9 million and auto liability  7 million we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported ibnr liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate as of december 31 2013 this ibnr liability was approximately 36 million 

 41 

accounting for tax obligations 

we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold we also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2013 and 2012 are appropriate the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power natural gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative natural gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in dte energy’s reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the company manages its marktomarket mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly the company records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or natural gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the company has established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the following tables provide details on changes in our mtm net asset or liability position during 2013

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

the electric and gas businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations however the company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas and storage sales revenue at the gas segment gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the company is exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

our gas storage and pipelines business segment has exposure to natural gas price fluctuations which impact the pricing for natural gas storage and transportation the company manages its exposure through the use of short medium and longterm storage and transportation contracts 

our power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity and natural gas product price risk the company manages its exposures to commodity price risk through the use of longterm contracts 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas coal crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

the company purchases and sells electricity natural gas coal coke and other energy products from and to governmental entities and numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail financial and other industries certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under the us bankruptcy code the company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss the company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss

electric 

description 

our electric segment consists principally of dte electric an electric utility engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 21 million customers in southeastern michigan our generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdeq electricity is generated from our fossilfuel plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant a nuclear plant and our wind and other renewable assets and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to three major classes of customers residential commercial and industrial throughout southeastern michigan 

revenue by service 



 

 

weather economic factors competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on dte electric 

fuel supply and purchased power 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have longterm and shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 221 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2013 through 2015 and approximately 35 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2013 through 2014 all of these contracts have pricing schedules we have approximately 81 of our 2013 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have our expected western coal rail requirements under contract through 2015 all of our expected eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2013 our expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities are under contract through 2014 

dte electric participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages 

properties 

dte electric owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2012  are as follows 



 

 

in 2008 a renewable portfolio standard was established for michigan electric providers targeting 10 of electricity sold to retail customers from renewable energy by 2015 dte electric has approximately 720 mw of owned or contracted renewable energy principally wind turbines located in gratiot tuscola huron and sanilac counties in michigan at december 31 2012 representing approximately 8 of electricity sold to retail customers approximately 510 mw is in commercial operation at december 31 2012 with an additional 210 mw expected in commercial operation in 2013 or early 2014 

dte electric owns and operates 671 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33648000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 430600 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 22306000 kva 

circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2012 



there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between dte electric and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission an unrelated company and connect to neighboring energy companies 

regulation 

dte electrics business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte electrics mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates dte electric with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of dte electrics nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see notes 3 10 11 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory we also partner with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers changes in the level of funding provided to our lowincome customers will affect the level of uncollectible expense 

strategy and competition 

we strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast michigan we can accomplish this goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable lowcost supplier of electricity to ensure generation and network reliability we continue to make capital investments in our generating plants and distribution system which will improve plant availability operating efficiencies and environmental compliance in areas that have a positive impact on reliability with the goal of high customer satisfaction 

our distribution operations focus on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service we seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

the electric customer choice program in michigan allows our electric customers to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers of generation services subject to limits customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2012  2011  and 2010  customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose mpscauthorized full service rates exceed market costs mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan have placed a 10 cap on the total potential customer choice related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric customer 

choice on our financial performance and full service customer rates we expect that in 2013  customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

gas 

description 

our gas segment consists of dte gas and citizens dte gas is a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase storage transportation distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

revenue by service 



 

 

 

 

our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter the impacts of changes in average customer usage are minimized by the rdm effective with the self implementation of rates on november 1 2012 the rdm was terminated the dte gas partial rate case settlement agreement approved by the mpsc in december 2012 creates a new rdm effective november 1 2013 which decouples weather normalized distribution revenue inside caps the caps are tied to expected customer conservation attributable to dte gas energy efficiency program or 1125 in year one increasing to 225 for the second and future periods 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas segment 

natural gas supply 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 24 bcf with approximately 64 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2012 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpsc approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2015 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions our primary longterm transportation supply contracts are as follows 



properties 

we own distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1173000 service pipelines and approximately 1309000 active meters we own approximately 2000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

we own storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 139 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties 

most of our distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by us through easements permits or licenses substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

we own 68 miles of transportation and gathering nonutility pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of michigan we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report 

regulation 

dte gas business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters dte gas mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments dte gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff 

dte gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the fercs jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by dte gas in interstate markets ferc granted dte gas 

authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates dte gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc 

we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to dte gas’ ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses dte gas’ uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory we also partner with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers changes in the level of funding provided to our lowincome customers will affect the level of uncollectible expense 

strategy and competition 

our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas services in michigan we expect future sales volumes to decline due to reduced natural gas usage by customers due to more efficient furnaces and appliances and an increased emphasis on conservation of energy usage we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

our extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled us to market 400 to 500 bcf annually for intermediate storage and transportation services for michigan gas producers marketers distribution companies and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

dte gas’ storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to dte gas customers as well as sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three years prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing 

gas storage and pipelines 

description 

gas storage and pipelines controls two natural gas storage fields intrastate lateral and intrastate gathering pipeline systems and has ownership interests in two interstate pipelines serving the midwest ontario and northeast markets the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by longterm fixedprice revenue contracts 

properties 

the gas storage and pipelines business holds the following property 



the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations pursuant to an operating agreement dte gas provides physical operations maintenance and technical support for the washington 10 and 28 storage facilities and for the dte gas pipeline 

regulation 

the gas storage and pipelines business operates natural gas storage facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and related services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff we also provide interstate services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc vector and millennium pipelines provide interstate transportation services in accordance with their fercapproved tariffs bluestone lateral is regulated as an intrastate pipeline by applicable agencies in the states of new york and pennsylvania 

strategy and competition 

our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan by expanding existing assets and developing new assets that are typically supported with long−term customer commitments we have competition from other pipelines and storage providers the gas storage and pipelines business focuses on asset development opportunities in the midwest−to−northeast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand much of the growth in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the eastern canada and the northeast us regions we believe that the vector and millennium pipelines are well positioned to provide access routes and low−cost expansion options to these markets in addition we believe that millennium pipeline is well positioned for growth in production from the marcellus shale especially with respect to marcellus production in northern pennsylvania and along the southern tier of new york gas storage and pipelines has executed an agreement with southwestern energy services company to support its bluestone lateral and susquehanna gathering system bluestone lateral is a 44mile pipeline in susquehanna county pennsylvania and broome county new york with the southern portion of the pipeline placed in service in 2012 and the northern portion scheduled to be in service in the first quarter of 2013 we expect to continue steady growth in the gas storage and pipelines business and are evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities that could include additional millennium expansions and laterals bluestone laterals and gathering expansions and other marcellus midstream development or partnering opportunities 

power and industrial projects 

description 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects this business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries as follows 

steel steel industry fuel and petroleum coke we produce metallurgical coke from two coke batteries with a capacity of 14 million tons per year we have an investment in a third coke battery with a capacity of 12 million tons per year we are investors in entities which sell steel industry fuel at three coke battery sites steel industry fuel facilities recycle tar decanter sludge a byproduct of the coking process we also provide pulverized coal and petroleum coke to the steel pulp and paper and other industries 

onsite energy we provide power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply to industrial customers we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the automotive airport chemical and other industries 

wholesale power and renewables we own and operate four biomassfired electric generating plants with a capacity of 183 mws we own a coalfired power plant currently undergoing conversion to biomass with an expected inservice date in 2013 the electric output is sold under long term power purchase agreements we also develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy in addition to providing environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

reduced emissions fuel ref  we own and operate nine ref facilities our facilities blend a proprietary additive with coal used in coalfired power plants resulting in reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide no and mercury hg qualifying facilities are eligible to generate tax credits for ten years upon achieving certain criteria the value of a tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor published by the internal revenue service the value of the tax credit is reduced if the reference price of coal exceeds certain thresholds the economic benefit of the ref facilities is dependent upon the generation of production tax credits we placed in service five ref facilities in 2009 and an additional four ref facilities in 2011 to optimize income and cash flow from the ref operations we sold membership interests in 2011 at two of the facilities treated as sales of tax credits for financial reporting purposes although both sales included a modest upfront payment from the tax investor the bulk of the proceeds will be received and the income for all of the proceeds will be recognized for financial reporting purposes as production tax credits are generated we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites additionally we intend to relocate certain underutilized facilities to alternative coalfired power plants which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2013 and future years   

properties and other 

the following are significant properties operated by the power and industrial projects segment 





 

 

regulation 

certain electric generating facilities within power and industrial projects have marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power the facilities are subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules certain power and industrial projects are also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel renewable power onsite energy landfill gas recovery and ref businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment new and pending legislation the number of 

competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our related businesses as we expand as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 

 

 

 

energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power gas and coal marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf under ferc asset management arrangements and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory contracts for pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the segment’s strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric gas and coal marketers financial institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the energy trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating the company believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities we monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that our commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk 

corporate and other 

description 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



air   dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide with further emission controls planned for reductions of mercury and other emissions future rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants over the next few years 

water   in response to an epa regulation dte electric is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes however the types of technologies are unknown at this time the epa has also issued an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines 

contaminated and other sites   prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as manufactured gas plant mgp sites gas segment owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites the company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for citizens fuel gas approved by the city of adrian will prevent mgp environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations 

we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the companys financial position and cash flows and the rates we charge our customers 

the epa has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash which may result in a designation as a hazardous waste the epa could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

see notes 11 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report 

employees 

we had approximately 9900 employees as of december 31 2012  of which approximately 4900 were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for the company’s represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in june and october 2013 




 item 1a   risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energys utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations our utilities typically selfimplement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with michigan law however if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the selfimplementation period we must refund the difference with interest our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various tracking and decoupling mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business if we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates our regulators may also decide to eliminate more of these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers we cannot predict what rates an mpsc order will adopt in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the electric customer choice program as originally contemplated in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates in addition such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 percent cap on the total potential customer choice related migration however even with the electric customer choicerelated relief received in prior dte electric rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation in the electric customer choice program there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in our generation fleet and gas distribution businesses these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities based on these regulations additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented the operations of our fossilfuel generation assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of our gas transportation businesses 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us regional and national economic conditions increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact our liquidity 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations our costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from our utility customers the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of 

our plan assets we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

our ability to access capital markets is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses in the past turmoil in credit markets has constrained and may again in the future constrain our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2016 but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities and nonutility businesses and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions 

construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to ris k we are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits construction disputes and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses 

our nonutility businesses may not perform to our expectations  we rely on our nonutility operations for an increasing portion of our earnings if our current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements we routinely have speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines we set resulting from the management of our business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position we manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources we generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery biomass fired electric generation reduced emission fuel renewable energy generation steel industry fuel and gas production operations all production tax credits taken after 2010 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows 

weather significantly affects operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business we are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy under the 

current michigan legislation we will be required in the future to provide a specified percentage of our power from michigan renewable energy sources we are implementing a strategy for complying with the existing state legislation but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation in addition there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources we are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and identifying third party projects in which we can invest we cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with these future projects 

we are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage we do not know how these programs will impact our business and future operating results 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our utility and nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services we supply collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flow 

threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our business we may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite our implementation of security measures all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes if our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition our generation plants gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products we have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers shareholders and employees our customers shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information and the united states regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or dte energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results 

a work interruption may adversely affect us unions represent approximately 4900 of our employees our contracts with several bargaining units for the majority of our represented employees are due to expire in june and october 2013 we cannot predict the outcome of those negotiations a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant 

unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

regulation 

certain electric generating facilities within power and industrial projects have marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power the facilities are subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules certain power and industrial projects are also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel renewable power onsite energy landfill gas recovery and ref businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment new and pending legislation the number of 

competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our related businesses as we expand as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 

 

 

 

energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power gas and coal marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf under ferc asset management arrangements and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines producers and generators and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory contracts for pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the segment’s strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric gas and coal marketers financial institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the energy trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating the company believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities we monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that our commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations actual costs to comply could vary substantially additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented 



air   dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules have led to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide with further emission controls planned for reductions of mercury and other emissions future rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants over the next few years 

water   in response to an epa regulation dte electric is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies dte electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes however the types of technologies are unknown at this time the epa has also issued an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines 

contaminated and other sites   prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as manufactured gas plant mgp sites gas segment owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites dte electric owns or previously owned three former mgp sites the company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for dte gas which allows dte gas to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for citizens fuel gas approved by the city of adrian will prevent mgp environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations 

we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines electric generating power plants and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the companys financial position and cash flows and the rates we charge our customers 

the epa has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash which may result in a designation as a hazardous waste the epa could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

see notes 11 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report 

employees 

we had approximately 9900 employees as of december 31 2012  of which approximately 4900 were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for the company’s represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in june and october 2013 

item 1a   risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energys utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations our utilities typically selfimplement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with michigan law however if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the selfimplementation period we must refund the difference with interest our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various tracking and decoupling mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business if we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates our regulators may also decide to eliminate more of these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers we cannot predict what rates an mpsc order will adopt in future rate cases new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the electric customer choice program as originally contemplated in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates in addition such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 percent cap on the total potential customer choice related migration however even with the electric customer choicerelated relief received in prior dte electric rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation in the electric customer choice program there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers

a work interruption may adversely affect us unions represent approximately 4900 of our employees our contracts with several bargaining units for the majority of our represented employees are due to expire in june and october 2013 we cannot predict the outcome of those negotiations a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant 

unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations  

item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in certain legal regulatory administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings include certain contract disputes environmental reviews and investigations audits inquiries from various regulators and pending judicial matters we cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings we regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss the resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in the periods they are resolved 

in july 2009 dte energy received a notice of violation novfinding of violation fov from the epa alleging among other things that five of dte electrics power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and operating permit requirements under the clean air act in june 2010 the epa issued a novfov making similar allegations related to a recent project and outage at unit 2 of the monroe power plant 

in august 2010 the united states department of justice at the request of epa brought a civil suit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against dte energy and dte electric related to the june 2010 novfov and the outage work performed at unit 2 of the monroe power plant but not relating to the july 2009 novfov among other relief the epa requested the court to require dte electric to install and operate the best available control technology at unit 2 of the monroe power plant further the epa requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require dte electric to i begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the monroe unit 2 modification and ii offset the pollution from monroe unit 2 through emissions reductions from dte electrics fleet of coalfired power plants until the new control equipment is operating on august 23 2011 the us district court judge granted dte energys motion for summary judgment in the civil case dismissing the case and entering judgment in favor of dte energy and dte electric on october 20 2011 the epa caused to be filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit oral arguments at the court of appeals were held on november 27 2012 and a decision is expected in early 2013 

dte energy and dte electric believe that the plants identified by the epa including unit 2 of the monroe power plant have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations depending upon the outcome of discussions with the epa regarding the two novsfovs dte electric could be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines dte energy and dte electric cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of these matters or the timing of its resolution 

in october 2010 the company received a notice of violation from the michigan department of natural resources mdnre alleging that the michigan coke battery facility violated the visible emission readings and quench water sampling requirements under applicable national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants regulations this notice of violation resulted from the company self reporting to the mdnre and the epa questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by the company to perform visible emissions readings and quench water sampling the information provided by the contractor was used by the company in filing certain reports with the mdnre and the epa the company has ceased using the contractor for these activities has retained a new certified contractor to perform the required activities and implemented standard operating procedures designed to prevent a reoccurrence of such a situation at this time the company cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this issue

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2012  operating revenues of approximately 88 billion and approximately 26 billion in assets we are the parent company of dte electric and dte gas regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout southeastern michigan we operate three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes our financial results 



the decrease in 2012 income from continuing operations is principally driven by an income tax benefit of 87 million in the corporate and other segment related to the enactment of the mcit in the second quarter of 2011 and lower results in the energy trading segment partially offset by improved results in the electric segment the increase in 2011 income from continuing operations is due to the above mentioned income tax benefit and higher earnings in energy trading partially offset by lower earnings in the electric and gas segments and in the power and industrial projects segment 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth maintain a strong balance sheet and continue our attractive dividend yield 

our utilities growth will be driven by mandated environmental and renewable investments in addition to base infrastructure investments we are focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability we operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with our regulators 

we have significant investments in our nonutility businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing meaningful lowrisk growth opportunities that leverage our assets skills and expertise and provide diversity in earnings and geography specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile we expect growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows issuance of debt and issuance of equity through our dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans we have an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage our exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

our utility businesses require significant base capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of their asset bases including power generation plants distribution systems storage fields and other facilities and fleets dte electrics capital investments over the 20132017 period are estimated at 47 billion for base infrastructure 12 billion for mandated environmental compliance requirements and 500 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency expenditures dte gas capital investments over the 20132017 period are estimated at 650 million for base infrastructure and 400 million for gas main renewal meter move out and pipeline integrity programs dte gas proposed in its rate case filing in april 2012 starting in 2013 a fiveyear annual incremental infrastructure recovery mechanism irm to recover costs associated with capital investment for the gas main renewal and meter move out programs the irm was not part of the rate case settlement approved in december 2012 and is expected to be resolved in 2013 dte electric and dte gas both plan to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior general rate case filing treatment dte electric is implementing a 20year renewable energy plan to address the provisions of michigan public act 295 of 2008 with the goals of delivering cleaner renewable electric generation to its customers further diversifying dte electrics and the state of michigans sources of electric supply and addressing the state and national goals of increasing energy independence dte electric routinely files renewable energy plans requests for approval of renewable contracts and for recovery of renewable capital expenditures with the mpsc as the implementation of the 20year renewable energy plan progresses 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers 

dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution these rules will lead to additional emission controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements dte electric has spent approximately 19 billion through 2012 it is estimated that dte electric will make capital expenditures of approximately 335 million in 2013 and up to approximately 16 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2020 based on current regulations 

climate regulation andor legislation has been proposed and discussed within the us congress and the epa the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs epa regulation of ghgs requires the best available control technology bact for new major sources or modifications to existing major sources that cause significant increases in ghg emissions in june 2012 the epa proposed new source performance standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new fossilfueled power plants these new source performance standards are expected to be finalized in 2013 as well as a proposed performance standard for carbon dioxide emissions from existing plants pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable andor nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and 

the development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments it is not possible to quantify these impacts on dte energy or its customers at this time 

see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and items 1 and 2 business and properties for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments 



electric 

our electric segment consists principally of dte electric 

electric results are discussed below 



gross margin  increased 97 million in 2012  and increased 25 million in 2011  revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statement of operations 

the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 



 

 

operation and maintenance  expense increased 59 million in 2012  and increased 65 million in 2011  the increase in 2012  is primarily due to higher employee benefit expenses of 53 million increased energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 17 million higher power plant generation expenses of 12 million increased distribution operations expenses of 4 million and higher expenses for low income energy assistance of 4 million partially offset by reduced restoration and line clearance expenses of 22 million and reduced uncollectible expenses of 9 million the increase in 2011 is primarily due to higher restoration and line clearance expenses of 41 million higher generation maintenance and outage expenses of 

25 million higher energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 19 million higher employee benefit expense of 9 million partially offset by reduced contributions of 23 million to the low income energy efficiency fund due to a court order and reduced uncollectible expenses of 7 million 

depreciation and amortization  expense increased 9 million in 2012  due primarily to higher amortization of regulatory assets partially offset by the net effect of lower depreciation rates on a higher depreciable base depreciation and amortization expense was 31 million lower in 201l due primarily to reduced amortization of regulatory assets partially offset by expenses related to a higher depreciable base 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net  decreased 15 million in 2012 and increased 19 million in 2011 principally attributable to a 2011 accrual of 19 million resulting from managements revisions of the timing and estimate of cash flows for the decommissioning of fermi 1 partially offset by a 2011 revision of 6 million in the timing and estimate of cash flows for the fermi 1 asbestos removal obligation and other items see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other income and deductions  were lower by 37 million in 2012 and 19 million in 2011 the decrease in 2012 was due primarily to the lower contributions to the dte foundation of 21 million and lower interest expense of 17 million the 2011 decrease was due to lower interest expense of 24 million partially offset by higher contributions to the dte foundation of 7 million 

outlook   —  we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we expect that our planned significant environmental and renewable expenditures will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and electric choice we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

on june 25 2012 our fermi 2 nuclear power plant was manually shutdown after one of the plants two nonsafety related feedwater pumps failed supported by a detailed analysis dte electric decided to operate the plant with one feedwater pump at a reduced power level until the second feedwater pump is returned to service the plant was restarted on july 30 2012 which restored production to 68 of full capacity we expect that a substantial portion of the property damage will be covered by existing insurance coverage subject to deductibles we are able to purchase sufficient power from miso to continue to provide uninterrupted service to our customers we plan to seek recovery of the related incremental purchased power costs through the pscr process the plant is scheduled to be brought down in the first quarter of 2013 to complete the repair 

gas   

our gas segment consists of dte gas and citizens 

gas results are discussed below 



gross margin  increased 4 million in 2012  and decreased 17 million in 2011  revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statement of operations the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





operation and maintenance  expense decreased 9 million in 2012 and increased 16 million in 2011  the decrease in 2012 is primarily due to reduced uncollectible expenses of 9 million lower legal liability expenses of 4 million and lower customer service expenses of 3 million partially offset by increased energy optimization expenses of 6 million and higher employee benefitrelated expenses of 3 million the increase in 2011 is primarily due to the 2010 deferral of 32 million of previously expensed costs to achieve restructuring expenses and increased energy optimization expenses of 10 million partially offset by reduced uncollectible expenses of 13 million reduced expenses for subsidiaries transferred to gas storage and pipelines segment of 6 million lower customer service expenses of 5 million and lower gas operations expenses of 4 million 

other income and deductions  were higher by 14 million in 2012 and lower by 5 million in 2011 the increase in 2012 was due primarily to higher contributions to the dte foundation of 21 million partially offset by lower interest expenses of 5 million the decrease in 2011 was due primarily to lower interest expense of 3 million 

income tax expense was lower by 10 million in 2012 the decrease is principally due to adjustments to deferred taxes 

outlook —  we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we expect that our planned significant infrastructure capital expenditures will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as weather the outcome of regulatory proceedings investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

gas storage and pipelines 

our gas storage and pipelines segment consists of our nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses 

gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 

net income attributable to dte energy increased 4 million and 6 million in 2012  and 2011  respectively the 2012  increase was primarily driven by higher earnings from our pipeline equity investments the 2011  increase was primarily driven by earnings from subsidiaries that were transferred from gas segment increased earnings from our pipeline equity investments and a settlement for customer gas treating services performed in prior years 

outlook —  our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan and is evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities millennium pipeline has secured customers for its phase 1  2 expansions which are scheduled to be in service in 2013 millenniums total capacity with the phase 1  2 expansion will increase from 525000 dthd to over 800000 dthd in addition the company has executed an agreement with southwestern energy services company to support its bluestone lateral and susquehanna gathering system bluestone is a 44mile pipeline in susquehanna county pennsylvania and broome county new york designed to initially flow over 275000 dthd to both millennium pipeline and tennessee pipeline the southern portion of bluestone was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the northern portion is scheduled to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2013 a portion of the susquehanna gathering system was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2012 and additional segments will be placed in service periodically over the next few years 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers produce reduced emissions fuel ref and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects 

power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



operating revenues  increased 694 million in 2012 and decreased 15 million in 2011 the 2012 increase is primarily due to a 740 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects of which 554 million represents affiliate transactions and a 30 million increase due to the newly acquired onsite projects partially offset by a 44 million decrease primarily due to lower volumes associated with the steel business and a 28 million decrease in coal transportation and marketing services business the 2011 decrease is primarily due to 166 million of lower coal transportation and marketing services related to an expired rail transportation contract at significantly below market rates 21 million of lower volumes associated with the coal blending business and a 20 million decrease from the sale of our rail services business in 2010 partially offset by a 92 million increase related to ref projects of which 90 million represents affiliate transactions a 74 million increase in coke demand and pricing and a 26 million increase in new onsite energy services projects 

operation and maintenance  expense increased 763 million in 2012 and increased 47 million in 2011 the 2012 increase is primarily due to a 770 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects of which 562 million represents affiliate transactions a 25 million increase due to the newly acquired onsite projects and a 11 million customer settlement partially offset by a 20 million decrease primarily due to lower volumes associated with the steel business and a 26 million decrease in coal transportation and marketing services business the 2011 increase is due primarily to a 103 million increase in coal costs a 93 million increase related to ref projects of which 91 million represents affiliate transactions and a 25 million increase in new onsite energy services projects partially offset by 127 million lower coal transportation and marketing services related to the expired rail transportation contract a 19 million decrease from the sale of our rail services business in 2010 17 million lower volumes primarily associated with the coal blending business and 11 million of lower coke battery operating costs 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net  decreased by 7 million in 2012 and decreased by 2 million in 2011 the 2012 decrease was due to a 3 million loss on the sale of assets associated with our coal transloading terminal and 3 million of impairments related to nonstrategic assets the 2011 decrease was due to an asset impairment related to our landfill gas recovery business of 11 million partially offset by installment gains of 9 million from the sale of a coke battery 

other income and deductions  were higher by 34 million in 2012 and higher by 23 million in 2011 the increase in 2012 and 2011 were due primarily to gains recognized in connection with sale of membership interest in ref facilities treated as sales of tax credits for financial reporting purposes the increase in 2011 also included 12 million of gains on the extinguishment of debt related to our landfill gas recovery business 

production tax credits increased by 38 million in 2012 primarily due to tax credits earned from ref projects the decrease of 27 million in 2011 was due primarily to the expiration of steel industry fuels credits as of december 31 2010 partially offset by tax credits earned from ref projects 

outlook   the company has constructed and placed in service nine ref facilities including three facilities located at third party owned coalfired power plants the company has sold membership interests in two of the facilities we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking tax investors for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites additionally we intend to relocate three underutilized facilities located at dte electric sites to alternative coalfired power plants which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2013 and future years one of the underutilized facilities is currently being relocated to a third party owned coalfired power plant the proceeds from executed and planned sales of membership interests in the ref facilities are expected to be received by the company on an installment basis and the 

company will recognize the related gains treated as sales of tax credits for financial reporting purposes as production tax credits are generated by the respective facilities 

we expect reduced production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2013 substantially all of the metallurgical coke margin is maintained under longterm contracts we have four biomassfired power generation facilities that were in operation in 2012 and we are converting an additional facility to be placed in service in 2013 our onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts during 2012 we purchased a portfolio of fourteen onsite energy projects primarily located in the midwest we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other energy projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power gas and coal marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf 

energy trading results are discussed below 



gross margin  decreased 66 million in 2012 and increased 75 million in 2011 the overall decrease in gross margin in 2012 was the result of decreased economic performance in our power and gas trading and power full requirements services strategies due to fewer market opportunities 

the decrease in 2012 represents a 28 million decrease in realized margins and a 38 million decrease in unrealized margins the 28 million decrease in realized margins is due to 74 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power and gas trading and power full requirements services strategies offset by 46 million of favorable results primarily in our gas full requirements services gas structured and gas transportation strategies the 38 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to 58 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power and gas full requirements services power trading and gas structured and storage strategies offset by 20 million of favorable results primarily in our gas trading strategy 

the increase in 2011 represents a 25 million increase in realized margins and 50 million increase in unrealized margins the 25 million increase in realized margins is due to 73 million of favorable results primarily in our power and gas trading and power full requirements services strategies offset by 48 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power origination gas structured and gas full requirements services strategies the 50 million increase in unrealized margins is due to 63 million of favorable results primarily in our power full requirements services gas structured and gas trading strategies offset by 13 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power transmission strategy 

outlook  in the near term we expect market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility or lack thereof in commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations 

the energy trading portfolio includes financial instruments physical commodity contracts and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and generation capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf under ferc asset management arrangements and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

see also the “fair value” section that follows 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

the 2012 net loss of 47 million represented a decrease of 70 million from the 2011 net income of 23 million the decrease resulted primarily from a income tax benefit of 87 million related to the enactment of the mcit in the second quarter of 2011 partially offset by lower interest costs 

the 2011 net income of 23 million was an improvement of 95 million from the 2010 net loss of 72 million the improvement resulted primarily from an income tax benefit of 87 million related to the enactment of the mcit in the second quarter of 2011 and lower interest costs 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

discontinued operations 

unconventional gas production 

in december 2012 the company sold its 100 equity interest in its unconventional gas production business which consisted of gas and oil production assets in the western barnett and marble falls shale areas of texas the properties in the sale included all of the reserves on approximately 88000 net acres near dallas texas the sale resulted in gross proceeds of approximately 255 million which resulted in a pretax loss of approximately 83 million 55 million after tax 

the activity of the discontinued unconventional gas production business is shown below the amounts exclude general corporate overhead costs and the related tax effects and no portion of corporate interest costs were allocated to discontinued operations 



capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements in 2013 we expect that cash from operations will be 18 billion due to higher working capital requirements we anticipate base level utility capital investments environmental renewable and energy optimization expenditures and expenditures for nonutility businesses in 2013 of approximately 22 billion we plan to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs 

cash from operations totaling 22 billion in 2012 was 201 million higher than the comparable 2011 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects cash generated from working capital items partially offset by lower net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred income taxes loss on sale of nonutility business and asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net 

cash from operations totaling 2 billion in 2011 was 183 million higher than the comparable 2010 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects cash generated from working capital items partially offset by lower net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred income taxes and asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net 

the changes in working capital items in both years primarily relate to pension and postretirement obligations and income tax items 

cash from investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within our nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we initially invest based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

net cash used for investing activities was higher in both 2012 and 2011 due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility and nonutility businesses the 2012 increase includes higher capital expenditures for the bluestone pipeline project and the power and industrial projects acquisition of fourteen onsite energy projects partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the unconventional gas production business 

cash from financing activities 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 percent to 52 percent to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash used for financing activities was 443 million in 2012 compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately 445 million for the same period in 2011 the change was primarily attributable to lower redemptions of longterm debt offset by a reduction in shortterm borrowings 

net cash used for financing activities was 445 million in 2011 compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately 586 million for the same period in 2010 the change was primarily attributable to increased shortterm borrowings and longterm debt issuances partially offset by increased longterm debt redemptions 

outlook 

we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and nonutility businesses we expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined our nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in our gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

we may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects 

we have approximately 800 million in longterm debt maturing in the next twelve months the repayment of the principal amount of the securitization debt is funded through a surcharge payable by dte electric’s customers the repayment of the other debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of longterm debt 

dte energy has approximately 16 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2012 consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements 

we expect to issue equity of approximately 300 million in 2013 through our dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans 

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making up to a 315 million contribution to the pension plans in 2013 in january 2013 the company contributed 145 million to its postretirement benefit plans at the discretion of management the company may make up to an additional 120 million contribution to its postretirement benefit plans in 2013 

various nonutility subsidiaries of the company have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade as of december 31 2012  the value of the transactions for which the company would have been exposed to collateral requests had dte energy’s credit rating been below investment grade on such date was approximately  326 million  in circumstances where an entity is downgraded below investment grade and collateral requests are made as a result the requesting parties often agree to accept less than the full amount of their exposure to the downgraded entity in addition the company maintains adequate credit facilities to meet this obligation should such an occurrence arise 

we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows 

see notes 11 12 15 17 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

contractual obligations 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2012 



 

 

credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the company’s credit ratings affect our cost of capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business dte electric dte gas and various nonutility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade certain of these contracts for dte electric and dte gas contain similar provisions in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade 

the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade our nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

 in january 2012 fitch ratings raised dte electrics senior secured debt rating from a to a and raised dte gas senior secured debt rating from bbb to a at the same time fitch ratings revised the outlook for dte gas from stable to positive in january 2013 fitch raised dte gas senior secured debt rating from a to a and revised the outlook from positive to stable in february 2012 moodys revised the outlook of dte energy dte electric and dte gas from stable to positive in february 2013 moodys raised dte energys senior unsecured debt rating from baa2 to baa1 dte electrics senior secured debt rating from a2 to a1 and dte gas senior secured debt rating from a2 to a1 at the same time moodys revised the outlook of dte energy dte electric and dte gas from positive to stable 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

derivatives and hedging activities 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the company and our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2012  and 2011  management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices we perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of our forward contracts see sensitivity analysis in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and managements assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations we perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350testing goodwill for impairment  which is intended to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairment by permitting an entity the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary “step zero” the standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairments tests for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we did not apply step zero for the 2012 goodwill impairment test and proceeded directly to step one of the test 

in performing step 1 of the impairment test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test we estimate the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance we also employ marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

we performed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2012 and determined that except for the unconventional gas production reporting unit the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed the 2 million of goodwill attributable to the unconventional gas production reporting unit was written off in the fourth quarter of 2012 in connection with its sale as part of the annual impairment test we also compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows 

as of october 1 2012 valuation date 



 



we perform an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

longlived assets 

we evaluate the carrying value of our longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require us to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact our earnings 

pension and postretirement costs 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the company the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required we consider historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

we had pension costs of 220 million in 2012 172 million in 2011 and 112 million in 2010 postretirement benefits costs were 151 million in 2012 122 million in 2011 and 164 million in 2010 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2012 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 825 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumptions we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets our 2013 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment 

management of 47 in equity markets 25 in fixed income markets and 28 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we are maintaining our longterm rate of return assumption for our pension plans and our postretirement health and life plans at 825 for 2013 we believe this rate is a reasonable assumption for the longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2013 given our investment strategy we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for our pension plans we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2012 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2012 we had 81 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets related to investment performance in 2012 2011 and 2010 for our postretirement benefit plans we use fair value when determining the mrv of postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased to 415 at december 31 2012 from 50 at december 31 2011 we estimate that our 2013 total pension costs will approximate 226 million compared to 220 million in 2012 primarily due to a lower discount rate and higher amortization of net actuarial losses partially offset by 2013 contributions our 2013 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 30 million compared to 151 million in 2012 primarily due to plan design changes and favorable retiree medical utilization partially offset by a lower discount rate higher amortization of net actuarial losses and updated assumed longterm retiree medical inflation our health care trend rate assumes 700 for 2013 through 2017 650 in 2018 600 in 2019 550 in 2020 and 500 in 2021 and beyond future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of dte gas negative pension expense dte gas records a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2012 pension costs by approximately 32 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2012 pension costs by approximately 14 million lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2012 postretirement costs by approximately 10 million lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have increased our 2012 postretirement costs by approximately 46 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2012 by approximately 26 million 

the value of our qualified pension and postretirement benefit plan assets was 44 billion at december 31 2012 and 39 billion at december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 our qualified pension plans were underfunded by 14 billion and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 12 billion the 2012 and 2011 funding levels were generally similar due to plan sponsor contributions in 2012 and 2011 largely offset by the impact of decreased discount rates 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets we made contributions to our qualified pension plans of 229 million in 2012 and 200 million in 2011 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making contributions to our qualified pension plans of 315 million in 2013 and up to 13 billion over the next five years we made postretirement benefit plan contributions of 140 million and 111 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in our utilities base rates as a result we contributed 145 million to our postretirement plans in january 2013 and expect to make up to an additional 120 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2013 and subject to mpsc funding requirements up to 622 million over the next five years the planned contributions will be made in cash dte energy common stock or a combination of cash and stock 

see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

legal reserves 

we are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us 

insured and uninsured risks 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure the maximum selfinsured retention for various risks is as follows property damage 10 million general liability 7 million workers’ compensation 9 million and auto liability7 million we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported ibnr liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate as of december 31 2012 this ibnr liability was approximately 37 million 

accounting for tax obligations 

we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold we also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 are appropriately accounted the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory pipeline transportation renewable energy credits and storage assets see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative gas storage transportation certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in dte energy’s reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the company manages its marktomarket mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the company has established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active 

markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the following tables provide details on changes in our mtm net asset or liability position during 2012 



the table below shows the maturity of our mtm positions 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

the electric and gas businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations however the company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the gas segment gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the company is exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

our gas storage and pipelines business segment has exposure to natural gas price fluctuations which impact the pricing for natural gas storage and transportation the company manages its exposure through the use of short medium and longterm storage and transportation contracts 

our power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity and natural gas product price risk to the extent that commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of longterm contracts we manage this exposure using forward energy capacity and futures contracts 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas coal crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

the company purchases and sells electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to governmental entities and numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail financial and other industries certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss the company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

other 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

trading activities 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2012 



 

 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2012 we had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately 7 percent excluding securitized debt 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of gas and power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we have entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through july 2016 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt obligations and foreign currency exchange forward contracts the commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange risk listed below principally relate to our energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2012 and 2011 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values

corporate structure 

based on the following structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance see note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for financial information by segment for the last three years 

electric utility 

 gas utility 

 nonutility operations 

 4 

electricity from biomassfired energy projects 

 corporate and other  includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

refer to our management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report for an indepth analysis of each segment’s financial results a description of each business unit follows 

electric utility 

description 

our electric utility segment consists principally of detroit edison our generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdeq electricity is generated from our fossilfuel plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant and a nuclear plant and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to three major classes of customers residential commercial and industrial principally throughout southeastern michigan 

revenue by service 



 

 weather economic factors competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on detroit edison 

fuel supply and purchased power 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts 

with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have longterm and short term contracts for the purchase of approximately 29 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2012 through 2014 and approximately 6 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2012 through 2014 all of these contracts have pricing schedules we have approximately 95 of our 2012 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have our expected western rail requirements under contract for the next four years all of our expected eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2012 and approximately 50 of this requirement is under contract in 2013 our expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities are under contract through 2014 

detroit edison participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles 

properties 

detroit edison owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2011  are as follows 



 

 

in december 2011 the connors creek 239 mw and marysville 84 mw generating plants and unit no 5 at the st clair generating plant 250 mw were retired consistent with detroit edisons operational plan 

in 2008 a renewable portfolio standard was established for michigan electric providers targeting 10 of electricity sold to retail customers from renewable energy by 2015 detroit edison has approximately 500 mw of owned or contracted renewable energy at december 31 2011 representing approximately 6 of electricity sold to retail customers approximately 

120 mw is in commercial operation at december 31 2011  with an additional 380 mw expected in commercial operation in 2012 or early 2013 

detroit edison owns and operates 671 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33516000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 428300 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 24421000 kva 

circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2011 



there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between detroit edison and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission an unrelated company and connect to neighboring energy companies 

regulation 

detroit edisons business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edisons mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edisons nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to detroit edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses detroit edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory we also partner with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers changes in the level of funding provided to our lowincome customers will affect the level of uncollectible expense 

strategy and competition 

we strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast michigan we can accomplish this goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable lowcost supplier of electricity to ensure generation and network reliability we continue to make capital investments in our generating plants and distribution system which will improve plant availability operating efficiencies and environmental compliance in areas that have a positive impact on reliability with the goal of high customer satisfaction 

our distribution operations focus on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service we seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

the electric customer choice program in michigan allows all of our electric customers to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers of generation services subject to limits customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2011  and 2010  and 3 of retail sales in 2009  customers 

participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose mpscauthorized full service rates exceed market costs mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are adjusting the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 cap on the total potential customer choice related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric customer choice on our financial performance in addition we had a choice incentive mechanism which was an overunder recovery mechanism that measured nonfuel revenues lost or gained as a result of fluctuations in electric customer choice sales effective with the october 2011 mpsc rate order this mechanism has been terminated and our customer rates reflect the current level of electric customer choice sales we expect that in 2012  customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

gas utility 

description 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

revenue by service 



 our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter we are minimizing the impacts of changes in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas utility segment 

natural gas supply 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 24 bcf with approximately 65 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2011 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpsc approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2014 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions our primary longterm transportation supply contracts are as follows 



properties 

we own distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1175000 service pipelines and approximately 1309000 active meters we own approximately 2000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

we own storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 138 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties 

most of our distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by us through easements permits or licenses substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

we own 67 miles of transportation and gathering nonutility pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of michigan we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report 

regulation 

michcons business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters michcons mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments michcon operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff 

michcon also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the fercs jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by michcon in interstate markets ferc granted michcon authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates michcon provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc 

we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses michcon’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory we also partner with federal state and local officials to attempt to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers changes in the level of funding provided to our low income customers will affect the level of uncollectible expense 

strategy and competition 

our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas services in michigan we expect future sales volumes to decline as a result of economic conditions a decrease in the number of customers reduced natural gas usage by customers due to more efficient furnaces and appliances and an increased emphasis on conservation of energy usage we are minimizing the impacts of changes in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

our extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled us to market 400 to 500 bcf annually for intermediate storage and transportation services for michigan gas producers marketers distribution companies and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

michcon’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to michcon’s customers as well as sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three years prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions weather and natural gas pricing 

gas storage and pipelines 

description 

gas storage and pipelines controls two natural gas storage fields and has ownership interests in two interstate pipelines serving the midwest ontario and northeast markets the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by longterm fixedprice revenue contracts 

properties 

the gas storage and pipelines business holds the following property 



the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations pursuant to an operating agreement michcon provides physical operations maintenance and technical support for the washington 10 and 28 storage facilities and for the michcon pipeline 

regulation 

the gas storage and pipelines business operates natural gas storage facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and related services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff we also provide interstate services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc vector and millennium pipelines provide interstate transportation services in accordance with their fercapproved tariffs 

strategy and competition 

our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan by expanding existing assets and developing new assets that are typically supported with longterm customer commitments we have competition from other pipelines and storage providers the gas storage and pipelines business focuses on asset development opportunities in the midwesttonortheast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand much of the growth in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the eastern canada and the northeast us regions we believe that the vector and millennium pipelines are well positioned to provide access routes and lowcost expansion options to these markets in addition we believe that millennium pipeline is well positioned for growth related to production from the marcellus shale especially with respect to marcellus production in northern pennsylvania and along the southern tier of new york gas storage and pipelines has executed an agreement with southwestern energy services company to support its bluestone lateral and gathering system bluestone is a 40 mile pipeline in susquehanna county pennsylvania and broome county new york scheduled to be in service in 2012 we expect to continue steady growth in the gas storage and pipelines business and are evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities that could include additional millennium expansions and laterals bluestone laterals and gathering expansions and other marcellus midstream development or partnering opportunities 

unconventional gas production 

description 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas and oil exploration development and production primarily within the barnett shale in north texas our acreage covers an area that produces high btu gas which provides a significant contribution to revenues from the value of natural gas liquids extracted from the gas stream during this period of low natural gas prices these natural gas liquids with prices correlated to crude oil prices have provided a significant increase to our realized wellhead price our drilling efforts have and will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil producing horizons total capital investment of 28 million and production of 51 bcfe in 2011 were slightly higher than 2010 oil production increased 58 over 2010 levels as a result of recent drilling in the marble falls formation shallow reserves lying above the barnett shale while gas production showed a 3 decline we executed on leasing opportunities to optimize our existing portfolio by acquiring acreage at attractive prices in 2011 bringing our total net acreage position to 87377 acres net of impairments and expirations 

properties and other 

the following information pertains to our interests in the barnett shale as of december 31 



 

 

 

 12 

strategy and competition 

we plan to focus on optimizing the productivity of our wells and to seek opportunities for monetization of properties in 2012 the majority of our acreage position has rights to shallow reserves lying above the barnett shale specifically the marble falls formation recent drilling efforts have been largely successful in finding oil and high btu gas we anticipate the continued development of this liquids play which is expected to add value to our asset base we expect total capital investment of 30  35 million to drill approximately 30 new wells and continue to acquire select acreage and achieve production of approximately 6  7 bcfe compared with 5 bcfe in 2011  the majority of the drilling activity is expected to occur during the first half of 2012 

due to increased activity in other shale plays throughout the country the availability of service providers has decreased however we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our drilling plans or operations since most oilfield services have been secured for the next 12 months 

from time to time we may use financial derivative contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas and oil on our forecasted sales volume at december 31 2011 we had no longterm fixed price contracts relating to natural gas and had the following financial contracts in place with our energy trading affiliate related to our projected oil production 



power and industrial projects 

description 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation and marketing and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects this business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries as follows 

steel steel industry fuel and petroleum coke we produce metallurgical coke from two coke batteries with a capacity of 14 million tons per year we have an investment in a third coke battery with a capacity of 12 million tons per year we are investors in entities which sell steel industry fuel at three coke battery sites steel industry fuels facilities recycle tar decanter sludge a byproduct of the coking process tax credits were generated in 2009 and 2010 from steel industry fuel activities the ability to generate tax credits from the steel industry fuel process expired at december 31 2010 we also provide pulverized coal and petroleum coke to the steel pulp and paper and other industries 

onsite energy we provide power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply to industrial customers we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the automotive airport chemical and other industries 

wholesale power and renewables we own and operate four biomassfired electric generating plants with a capacity of 183 mws we own a coalfired power plant currently undergoing conversion to biomass with an expected inservice date in 2013 the electric output is sold under long term power purchase agreements we also develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy in addition to providing environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

reduced emissions fuel  we own and operate nine reduced emissions fuel facilities our facilities blend a proprietary additive with coal used in coalfired power plants resulting in reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide no and mercury hg qualifying facilities are eligible to generate tax credits for ten years upon achieving certain criteria the value of a tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor published annually by the internal revenue service the value of the tax credit is reduced if the reference price of coal exceeds certain thresholds the economic benefit of the reduced emissions fuel facilities is dependent upon the generation of production tax credits we placed in service five facilities in 2009 and an additional four facilities in 2011 to optimize income and cash flow from the reduced emissions fuel operations we sold membership interests in 2011 at two of the facilities that are located at detroit edison sites which in substance represented a sale of production tax credits although both sales included a modest upfront payment from the tax investor the bulk of the proceeds will be received and the income for all of the proceeds will be recognized as production tax credits are generated we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking tax investors for facilities operating at detroit edison and other utility sites additionally we intend to relocate certain underutilized facilities located at detroit edison sites to alternative coalfired power plants which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2012 and future years   

coal services the business provides coal transportation and related services including fuel to our customers with significant energy requirements which include electric utilities merchant power producers integrated steel mills and large industrial companies we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for those energyintensive customers we own and operate a coal transloading terminal which provides storage and blending services for our customers we also engage in coal marketing which includes the marketing and trading of physical coal and coal financial instruments and forward contracts for the purchase and sale of emission allowances

strategy and competition 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel renewable power onsite energy coal marketing storage and blending landfill gas recovery and reduced emission fuel businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment new and pending legislation the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our related businesses as we expand as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 energy trading 

description 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and ancillary services to various utilities and producers which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf under ferc asset management arrangements our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the segment’s strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

regulation 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric and gas marketers financial 

institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the energy trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating the company believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities we monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that our commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk 

corporate and other

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations 



air   detroit edison is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze mercury and other air pollution these rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide mercury and other emissions further additional rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants over the next few years 

water   in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes in addition there are proposed rules that may require the installation of cooling towers at some facilities at a cost substantially greater than was initially estimated for other mitigative technologies the epa has also issued an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines 

contaminated and other sites   prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as manufactured gas plant mgp sites gas utility owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites detroit edison owns or previously owned three former mgp sites the company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for michcon which allows michcon to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for citizens fuel gas approved by the city of adrian will prevent mgp environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the company’s financial position and cash flows 

the epa has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash which may result in a designation as a hazardous waste the epa could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

see notes 11 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report 

employees 

we had approximately 9800 employees as of december 31 2011  of which approximately 5000 were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for the company’s represented employees the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in august 2012 and june and october 2013 




 item 1a   risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energys utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers rates our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations our utilities typically selfimplement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with michigan law however if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the selfimplementation period we must refund the difference with interest our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various tracking and decoupling mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business if we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates our regulators may also decide to eliminate more of these mechanisms in future rate cases which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers we cannot predict what rates an mpsc order will adopt in future rate cases    new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses 

changes to michigans electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the electric customer choice program as originally contemplated in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates in addition such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 percent cap on the total potential customer choice related migration however even with the electric customer choicerelated relief received in recent detroit edison rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation in the electric customer choice program there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our utility and nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with our utilities and certain nonutility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel industries which have undergone considerable financial distress exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services we supply collections of accounts receivable reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding and potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas could result in decreased earnings and cash flow 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers 

uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning longterm capital projects in our generation fleet and gas distribution businesses    these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities based on these regulations additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented the operations of our fossilfuel generation assets and our unconventional gas production assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters   

future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of our gas transportation businesses   

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers our nonutility businesses including our energy transportation business are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and gas and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses we have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in our utility and nonutility businesses but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for our nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers or provide energy transportation services 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of our facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses 

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us regional and national economic condition s  increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact our liquidity 

our ability to access capital markets is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses in the past turmoil in credit markets has constrained and may again in the future constrain our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital 

markets our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2015 but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions   

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations our costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from detroit edison or michcon customers the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to risk  we are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits construction disputes and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements we routinely have speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines we set resulting from the management of our business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position we manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

our nonutility businesses may not perform to our expectations   we rely on our nonutility operations for a portion of our earnings if our current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value 

our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change while great care is exercised in utilizing historical information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of future production and cash flow we cannot provide absolute assurance that our estimates of our barnett gas reserves are accurate we estimate proved gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves including factors beyond our control reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves or of cash flows attributable to such reserves is a function of the available data assumptions regarding expenditures for future development and exploration activities and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment additionally reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history development and exploration activities and prices of gas actual future production revenue taxes development expenditures operating expenses quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information we used 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources we generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery biomass fired electric generation reduced emission fuel renewable energy credits steel industry fuel and gas production operations all production tax credits 

taken after 2008 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows 

weather significantly affects operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business we are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy under the current michigan legislation we will be required in the future to provide a specified percentage of our power from michigan renewable energy sources we are developing a strategy for complying with the existing state legislation but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation in addition there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources we are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and identifying third party projects in which we can invest we cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with these future projects 

we are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage we do not know how these programs will impact our business and future operating results 

threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our business we may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite our implementation of security measures all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes if our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition our generation plants gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products we have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers shareholders and employees our customers shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information and the united states regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or dte energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results   

a work interruption may adversely affect us unions represent approximately 5000 of our employees our contract with one union representing about 500 of our electrical linemen is due to expire in august 2012 we cannot predict the outcome of those negotiations a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in certain legal regulatory administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings include certain contract disputes environmental reviews and investigations audits inquiries from various regulators and pending judicial matters we cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings we regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss the resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in the periods they are resolved 

in april 2006 the prior owners of the coke battery facility in pennsylvania that the company purchased in 2008 received a notice of violationfinding of violation novfov from the epa alleging violations of the lowest achievable emission rate requirements associated with visible emissions from the combustion stack door leaks and charging activities at the coke battery facility the epa has also alleged certain violations of the clean water act but has not issued a notice of violation in connection with these alleged violations the company is in the process of negotiating a consent order with the epa to settle these historic air and water issues the company expects to enter into the consent order during the first quarter of 2012 

in february 2008 dte energy was named as one of approximately 24 defendant oil power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in a united states district court the plaintiffs the native village of kivalina and city of kivalina which are home to approximately 400 people in alaska claim that the defendants business activities have contributed to global warming and as a result higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall and winter as a result the plaintiffs are seeking damages of up to 400 million for relocation costs associated with moving the village to a safer location as well as unspecified attorneys fees and expenses on october 15 2009 the us district court granted defendants motions dismissing all of plaintiffs federal claims in the case on two independent grounds 1 the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claims because of the political question doctrine and 2 plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims the court also dismissed plaintiffs state law claims because the court lacked supplemental jurisdiction over them after it dismissed the federal claims the dismissal of the state law claims was without prejudice the plaintiffs have appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 

in july 2009 dte energy received a novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five of detroit edisons power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and operating permit requirements under the clean air act in june 2010 the epa issued a novfov making similar allegations related to a recent project and outage at unit 2 of the monroe power plant 

in august 2010 the united states department of justice at the request of epa brought a civil suit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against dte energy and detroit edison related to the june 2010 novfov and the outage work performed at unit 2 of the monroe power plant but not relating to the july 2009 novfov among other relief the epa requested the court to require detroit edison to install and operate the best available control technology at unit 2 of the monroe power plant further the epa requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require detroit edison to i begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the monroe unit 2 modification and ii offset the pollution from monroe unit 2 through emissions reductions from detroit edisons fleet of coalfired power plants until the new control equipment is operating on august 23 2011 the us district court judge granted dte energys motion for summary judgment in the civil case dismissing the case and entering judgment in favor of dte energy and detroit edison on october 20 2011 the epa caused to be filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit 

dte energy and detroit edison believe that the plants identified by the epa including unit 2 of the monroe power plant have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations depending upon the outcome of discussions with the epa regarding the two novsfovs detroit edison could be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines dte energy and detroit edison cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of these matters or the timing of its resolution 

in october 2010 the company received a notice of violation from the michigan department of natural resources mdnre alleging that the michigan coke battery facility violated the visible emission readings and quench water sampling requirements under applicable national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants regulations this notice of violation resulted from the company self reporting to the mdnre and the epa questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by the company to perform visible emissions readings and quench water sampling the information provided by the   contractor was used by the company in filing certain reports with the mdnre and the epa the company has ceased using the contractor for these activities has retained a new certified contractor to perform the required activities and implemented standard operating procedures designed to prevent a reoccurrence of such a situation at this time the company cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this issue 

in december 2010 the company received a notice of violation from the detroit water and sewerage department dwsd alleging that effluent discharges from the michigan coke battery facility violated the city of detroit ordinance the general pretreatment standards and the terms of a consent judgment entered between the company and the dwsd with respect to the michigan coke battery facility in march 2009 the company has settled similar alleged violations with respect to the michigan coke battery facility with the dwsd in the past the company has installed a biological waste water treatment plant at the michigan coke battery facility in accordance with the consent judgment that is designed to meet the effluent limitations and is in the process of optimizing plant performance to minimize any future excursions of the ordinance and the general pretreatment standards the dwsd has demanded payment of 176000 in penalties in connection with the alleged violations the company is actively pursuing a settlement with dwsd but we cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter 

in august 2011 allegheny county health department achd issued an enforcement order alleging 114 incidents of fugitive pushing emissions at the coke battery facility in pennsylvania and assessing a civil penalty of 114000 the company has appealed the enforcement order the company is in the process of negotiating a consent order with achd to settle this enforcement order the company expects to enter into the consent order in the first half of 2012 the company is completing a maintenance program designed to minimize future fugitive pushing emissions from the coke battery facility

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2011  operating revenues of approximately 89 billion and approximately 26 billion in assets we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout southeastern michigan we operate four energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes our financial results 



the increase in 2011 net income attributable to dte energy as compared to 2010 was driven by higher earnings in energy trading partially offset by lower earnings in the electric and gas utilities and in the power and industrial projects segment the 2011 increase is also due to an income tax benefit of 87 million in the corporate and other segment related to the enactment of the mcit in the second quarter of 2011 the increase in 2010 net income attributable to dte energy as compared to 2009 was primarily due to improved results in the electric and gas utilities and in the power and industrial projects segment partially offset by lower earnings in energy trading 

please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section 

dte energys strategy is to achieve longterm earnings growth a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield 

our utilities growth will be driven by mandated environmental and renewable investments in addition to base infrastructure investments we are focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability we operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with our regulators 

we have significant investments in our nonutility businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing meaningful lowrisk growth opportunities that leverage our assets skills and expertise and provide diversity in earnings and geography specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile we expect growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced shortterm and longterm financing nearterm growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows expected monetization of our unconventional gas production business issuance of debt and issuance of equity through our dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans we have adopted an enterprise risk management program that among other things is designed to monitor and manage our exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes interest rates and counterparty credit risk 

capital investments 

our utility businesses require significant base capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of their asset bases including power generation plants distribution systems storage fields and other facilities and fleets detroit edisons capital investments over the 20122016 period are estimated at 4 billion for base capital investments 13 billion to 18 billion for mandated environmental requirements and 900 million for renewable and energy efficiency expenditures michcons capital investments over the 20122016 period are estimated at 675 million for base capital investments 250 million for gas main renewal and 115 million for meter move out programs detroit edison and michcon both plan to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior general rate case filing treatment detroit edison is implementing a 20year renewable energy plan to address the provisions of michigan public act 295 of 2008 with the goals of delivering cleaner renewable electric generation to its customers further diversifying detroit edisons and the state of michigans sources of electric supply and addressing the state and national goals of increasing energy independence detroit edison routinely files renewable energy plans requests for approval of renewable contracts and for recovery of renewable capital expenditures with the mpsc as the implementation of the 20year renewable energy plan progresses 

in april 2010 the company signed an agreement with the us department of energy for a grant of approximately 84 million in matching funds on total anticipated spending of approximately 168 million related to the accelerated deployment of smart grid technology in michigan through 2012 the smart grid technology includes the establishment of an advanced metering infrastructure and other technologies that address improved electric distribution service see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers 

detroit edison is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution these rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements detroit edison has spent approximately 17 billion through 2011 the company estimates detroit edison will make capital expenditures of approximately 255 million in 2012 and up to approximately 19 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2021 based on current regulations 

climate regulation andor legislation has been proposed and discussed within the us congress and the epa however the current 112 th  congress is not expected to pass any major energy or climate bills meanwhile the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of greenhouse gases epa regulation of greenhouse gases ghgs began in 2011 and requires the best available control technology bact for new major sources or modifications to existing major sources that cause significant increases in ghg emissions the impact of this rule is uncertain until bact is 

better defined by the permitting agencies pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable andor nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments it is not possible to quantify these impacts on dte energy or its customers at this time 

see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and items 1 and 2 business and properties for further discussion of environmental matters 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments 



electric utility 

our electric utility segment consists principally of detroit edison 

electric utility results are discussed below 



gross margin  increased 25 million in 2011  and increased 190 million in 2010  revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statement of operations the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 



 

 29 



 

 operation and maintenance  expense increased 65 million in 2011  and increased 28 million in 2010  the increase in 2011  is primarily due to higher restoration and line clearance expenses of 41 million higher generation maintenance and outage expenses of 25 million higher energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 19 million higher employee benefit expense of 9 million partially offset by reduced contributions of 23 million to the low income energy efficiency fund due to a court order and reduced uncollectible expenses of 7 million the increase in 2010  is primarily due to higher restoration and line clearance expenses of 40 million higher energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 18 million higher legal expenses of 15 million partially offset by reduced uncollectible expenses of 20 million lower generation expenses of 18 million and lower employee benefitrelated expenses of 6 million 

depreciation and amortization  expense decreased 31 million in 2011  due primarily to reduced amortization of regulatory assets partially offset by expense related to higher depreciable base depreciation and amortization expense was 5 million higher in 2010 due primarily to expense related to higher depreciable base and increased amortization of regulatory assets 

taxes other than income were higher by 32 million in 2010 due primarily to a 30 million reduction in property tax expense in 2009 due to refunds received in settlement of appeals of assessments for prior years 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net  increased 19 million in 2011 principally attributable to an accrual of 19 million resulting from managements revisions of the timing and estimate of cash flows for the decommissioning of fermi 1 partially offset by a revision of 6 million in the timing and estimate of cash flows for the fermi 1 asbestos removal obligation and other items see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

outlook    the base rate and rehearing orders approved by the mpsc in fourth quarter 2011 provide for an annual revenue increase of 188 million and an authorized return on equity of 105 the base rate order terminated detroit edisons restoration line clearance and uncollectible expense tracking mechanisms termination of these trackers may result in increased volatility in detroit edisons results due to weather the number of storms and uncollectible accounts receivable the choice incentive mechanism was also terminated in the base rate order base rates included electric customer choice sales at the capped 10 percent level see note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the rate orders received by detroit edison 

  

we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we expect that our planned significant environmental and renewable expenditures will result in earnings growth looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as the outcome of regulatory proceedings investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

gas utility 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

gas utility results are discussed below 



gross margin  decreased 17 million in 2011  and increased 47 million in 2010  revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statement of operations the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 





operation and maintenance  expense increased 16 million in 2011  and decreased 37 million in 2010  the increase in 2011  is primarily due to the 2010 deferral of 32 million of previously expensed cta restructuring expenses and increased energy optimization expenses of 10 million partially offset by reduced uncollectible expenses of 13 million reduced expenses for subsidiaries transferred to gas storage and pipelines segment of 6 million lower customer service expenses of 5 million and lower gas operations expenses of 4 million the decrease in 2010  is primarily due to reduced uncollectible 

expenses of 35 million and the deferral of 32 million of previously expensed cta restructuring expenses partially offset by higher maintenance expenses of 11 million increased energy optimization expenses of 9 million higher employee benefitrelated expenses of 3 million and contributions of 3 million to the low income energy efficiency fund 

outlook —  we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence and sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity we plan to file a base rate case in the second quarter 2012 and expect to selfimplement new rates in the fourth quarter 2012 at the beginning of the heating season unfavorable economic trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of customers in our service territory increased customer conservation and continued high levels of theft and uncollectible accounts receivable the mpsc has provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that addresses changes in average customer usage due to general economic conditions and conservation these and other tracking mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in lower earnings volatility in the future looking forward additional factors may impact earnings such as infrastructure improvement capital programs the outcome of future regulatory proceedings investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity minimize lost and stolen gas and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

gas storage and pipelines 

our gas storage and pipelines segment consists of our nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses 

gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 

net income attributable to dte energy increased 6 million and 2 million in 2011  and 2010  respectively the 2011  increase was primarily driven by earnings from subsidiaries that were transferred from gas utility increased earnings from our pipeline equity investments and a settlement for customer gas treating services performed in prior years the 2010  increase was driven by higher gas storage revenues and lower project development costs 

outlook —  our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan and is evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities millennium pipeline has secured customers for its phase 1  2 expansions which are scheduled to be inservice in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013 respectively millenniums total capacity with the phase 1  2 expansion will increase from 525000 dthd to over 800000 dthd in addition we have executed an agreement with southwestern energy services company to support our bluestone lateral and gathering system bluestone is a 40 mile pipeline in susquehanna county pennsylvania and broome county new york designed to initially flow 250000 dthd to both millennium pipeline and tennessee pipeline and is scheduled to be in service in 2012 we plan to spend up to 280 million over the next five years on the bluestone lateral and gathering system 

unconventional gas production 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas and oil exploration development and production within the barnett shale in northern texas 

unconventional gas production results are discussed below 



unconventional gas production results were impacted by the impairment of expired or expiring leasehold positions in 2010 and 2009 revenues and expenses increased in 2011 and 2010 as a result of new wells on line increased liquids prices and higher crude oil production 

outlook — we plan to focus on optimizing the productivity of our wells and to seek opportunities for monetization of properties in 2012 the majority of our acreage position has rights to shallow reserves lying above the barnett shale specifically the marble falls formation recent drilling efforts have been largely successful in finding oil and high btu gas we anticipate the continued development of this liquids play which is expected to add value to our asset base we expect total capital investment of 30  35 million to drill approximately 30 new wells and continue to acquire select acreage and achieve production of approximately 6  7 bcfe compared with 5 bcfe in 2011  the majority of the drilling activity is expected to occur in the first half of 2012 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation marketing and trading services and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects 

power and industrial projects results are discussed below 



vies  — as discussed in note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2010 we adopted the provisions of asu 200917 amendments to fasb interpretation 46r  asu 200917 changed the methodology for determining the primary beneficiary of a vie from a quantitative risk and rewardsbased model to a qualitative determination the company reevaluated prior vie and primary beneficiary determinations and as a result began consolidating five entities since these entities were previously accounted for under the equity method the vie consolidation had no impact on net income attributable to dte energy as a result of the consolidation of these vies operating revenues and operation and maintenance expense increased 174 million and 122 million respectively in 2010 

operating revenues  decreased 15 million in 2011 and increased 309 million in 2010 net of vie adjustments the 2011 decrease is primarily due to 166 million of lower coal transportation and marketing services related to an expired rail transportation contract at significantly below market rates 21 million of lower volumes associated with the coal blending business and a 20 million decrease from the sale of our rail services business in 2010 partially offset by a 92 million increase related to reduced emissions fuels projects 74 million increase in coke demand and pricing and a 26 million increase in new onsite energy services projects the 2010 increase is attributed primarily to 172 million of higher coke sales and a 156 million increase in onsite services partially offset by a 18 million decrease in coal trading and transportation services 

operation and maintenance  expense increased 47 million in 2011 and increased 263 million in 2010 net of vie adjustments the 2011 increase is due primarily to a 103 million increase in coal costs a 93 million increase related to reduced emission fuels projects and a 25 million increase in new onsite energy services projects partially offset by 127 million lower coal transportation and marketing services related to the expired rail transportation contract 19 million decrease from the sale of our rail services business in 2010 17 million lower volumes primarily associated with the coal blending business and 11 million of lower coke battery operating costs the 2010 increase is due primarily to 118 million of higher coke production and a 154 million increase in onsite services partially offset by 10 million of lower coal trading and transportation services 

asset gains losses   decreased by 2 million in 2011 and increased by 8 million in 2010 the 2011 decrease was due to an asset impairment related to our landfill gas recovery business of 11 million partially offset by installment gains of 9 million from the sale of a coke battery the 2010 increase is due primarily to the sale of dte rail services and an increase in installment gains from the sale of a coke battery 

other income and deductions  were higher by 23 million in 2011 and lower by 14 million in 2010 the increase in 2011 was due primarily to the production of refined coal from our reduced emissions fuels projects giving rise to tax credits which the company has sold to third parties and gains on the extinguishment of debt related to our landfill gas recovery business the decrease in 2010 was due primarily to lower equity earnings in various projects and higher intercompany interest associated with project investment 

production tax credits decreased by 27 million in 2011 due primarily to the expiration of steel industry fuels credits as of december 31 2010 partially offset by tax credits earned from reduced emission fuel projects the increase of 21 million in 2010 was due primarily to a full year of steel industry fuels tax credits 

outlook  — the company has constructed and placed in service nine reduced emission fuel facilities the company has sold a membership interest in two of these facilities that are located at the detroit edison sites additionally the company has constructed two facilities located at third party owned coalfired power plants we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking tax investors for facilities operating at detroit edison and other utility sites additionally we intend to relocate four underutilized facilities located at detroit edison sites to alternative coalfired power plants which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2012 and future years the executed and planned sales of membership interests in the reduced emission fuel facilities represent in substance the sale of production tax credits the proceeds from these sales are expected to be received by the company on an installment basis and the company will recognize the related income as production tax credits are generated by the respective facilities 

we expect sustained production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2012 substantially all of the metallurgical coke is under longterm contracts our onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts environmental and economic trends are creating growth opportunities for renewable power the increasing number of states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides investment opportunity in wastewood power generation in addition to the four facilities that will be in operation in 2012 we are converting an additional facility to be placed in service in 2013 we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other energy projects at favorable prices 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf 

energy trading results are discussed below 



gross margin  increased 75 million in 2011 and decreased 112 million in 2010 the overall increase in gross margin in 2011 was the result of improved economic performance coupled with the absence of prior year timing losses we experienced timingrelated earnings volatility based on market movement related to derivative contracts 

the increase in 2011 represents a 25 million increase in realized margins and 50 million increase in unrealized margins the 25 million increase in realized margins is due to 73 million of favorable results primarily in our power and gas trading and power full requirements strategies offset by 48 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power origination gas structured and gas full requirements strategies the 50 million increase in unrealized margins is due to 63 million of favorable results primarily in our power full requirements gas structured and gas trading strategies offset by 13 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power transmission strategy 

the decrease in 2010 represents a 78 million decrease in realized margins and 34 million decrease in unrealized margins the 78 million decrease in realized margins is due to 108 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power and gas trading and gas full requirements strategies offset by 30 million of favorable results primarily in our power full requirements and power origination strategies the 34 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to 56 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power trading strategy and the absence of prior year timingrelated gains related to our gas transportation strategy these decreases were offset by 22 million of favorable results primarily due to timingrelated gains in our gas full requirements strategy 

operation and maintenance  expense increased 4 million in 2011 and decreased 12 million in 2010 the 2011 increase was primarily due to higher incentive costs and the 2010 decrease was primarily due to lower incentive costs both of which were impacted by economic performance 

income tax provision  increased 29 million in 2011 due to higher pretax income income taxes decreased 32 million in 2010 due to lower pretax income partially offset by 10 million of favorable taxrelated adjustments in 2009 resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits 

outlook — in the near term we expect market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility or lack thereof in commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations 

the energy trading portfolio includes financial instruments physical commodity contracts and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generation capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and related services and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various utilities and producers which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf under ferc asset management arrangements significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

see also the “fair value” section that follows 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

the 2011 net income of 26 million was an improvement of 95 million from the 2010 net loss of 69 million the improvement resulted primarily from an income tax benefit of 87 million related to the enactment of the mcit in the second quarter of 2011 and lower interest costs see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the 2010 net loss of 69 million was an improvement of 1 million from the 2009 net loss of 70 million the net 1 million improvement was a result of the 2009 donation to the dte energy foundation of 10 million and lower impairments of investments of 3 million partially offset by higher state and local taxes of 3 million higher tax related interest of 5 million and increased financing costs of 5 million 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements in 2012 we expect that cash from operations will be 19 billion due to 

lower working capital requirements we anticipate base level utility capital investments environmental renewable and energy optimization expenditures and expenditures for nonutility businesses in 2012 of approximately 19 billion we plan to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 



cash from operating activities 

a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs 

cash from operations totaling 2 billion in 2011 was 183 million higher than the comparable 2010 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects cash generated from working capital items partially offset by lower net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred income taxes and gains on sales of assets 

cash from operations totaling 18 billion in 2010 was consistent with the comparable 2009 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items offset by cash used for working capital items 

cash from investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets 

capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements 

capital spending within our nonutility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we initially invest based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

net cash used for investing activities was higher in both 2011 and 2010 due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility and nonutility businesses 

cash from financing activities 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 percent to 52 percent to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 

net cash used for financing activities was 445 million in 2011 compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately 586 million for the same period in 2010 the change was primarily attributable to increased shortterm borrowings and longterm debt issuances partially offset by increased longterm debt redemptions 

net cash used for financing activities was 586 million in 2010 compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately 789 million for the same period in 2009 the change was primarily attributable to decreased payments for shortterm borrowings increases in issuances of longterm debt were offset by increased longterm debt redemptions 

outlook 

we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and nonutility businesses we expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined our nonutility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in our gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments 

we may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects 

we have approximately 500 million in longterm debt maturing in the next twelve months most of these maturities relate to securitization and other detroit edison issues the repayment of the principal amount of the securitization debt is funded through a surcharge payable by detroit edison’s electric customers the repayment of the other detroit edison debt is expected to be refinanced with longterm debt 

in october 2011 the company completed an early renewal of its 10 billion and 800 million syndicated unsecured revolving credit facilities before their scheduled expiration in august 2012 and august 2013 respectively the new 18 billion fiveyear facility will expire in october 2016 and has covenants similar to the prior facilities dte energy has approximately 14 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2011 

we expect to issue equity of approximately 300 million through our dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans 

at the discretion of management and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making up to a 240 million contribution to the pension plans in 2012 in january 2012 the company contributed 140 million to its other postretirement benefit plans at the discretion of management the company may make up to an additional 120 million contribution to its veba trusts in 2012 

the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 provided for a special allowance for bonus depreciation in 2011 and 2012 bonus depreciation is accelerated depreciation on certain types of business equipment that allows a tax deduction of either 50 or 100 of the cost of qualifying property in the year the asset is placed in service dte energy expects to generate up to approximately 120 million in cash from 2012 bonus depreciation deductions a significant portion of which is expected to result from detroit edison property plant and equipment expenditures during the qualifying period the cash benefit is an acceleration of tax deductions that the company would otherwise have received over 20 years 

we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows

contractual obligations 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2011 



 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the company’s credit ratings affect our cost of capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

as part of the normal course of business detroit edison michcon and various nonutility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade certain of these contracts for detroit edison and michcon contain similar provisions in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade our nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

in january 2011 fitch ratings revised the rating outlook for detroit edison from stable to positive due to improvement in its credit protection measures as a result of supportive regulatory policies in michigan in january 2012 due to several factors including improved and sustained earnings and an overall constructive regulatory environment fitch ratings raised detroit edisons senior secured debt rating from a to a and raised michcons senior secured debt rating from bbb to a at the same time fitch ratings revised the rating outlook for michcon from stable to positive 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses detroit edison and michcon are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

in may 2011 detroit edison filed an application with the mpsc for approval of its initial pilot rdm reconciliation for the period february 2010 through january 2011 requesting authority to refund to customers approximately  56 million  plus interest this amount was accrued by detroit edison at december 31 2011 there are various interpretations and alternative calculation methodologies proposed by parties involved in the reconciliation proceeding relating to the pilot rdm refund calculation that could ultimately be adopted by the mpsc which may result in a range of customer refund amounts from 56 million to 140 million for this initial reconciliation filing under the pilot rdm 

in addition detroit edison has accrued a pilot rdm liability for february 2011 through october 2011 of approximately  71 million  plus interest detroit edison terminated the pilot rdm effective october 2011 as ordered by the mpsc and has requested a rehearing on this issue asserting that for reconciliation purposes the pilot rdm should have been considered terminated in april 2011 when detroit edison selfimplemented rates consistent with prior mpsc orders an april 2011 termination would result in a decrease to the liability however there can be no assurance that detroit edison will prevail in this matter in addition similar to the initial reconciliation case there could be various interpretations and alternative calculation methodologies that could be adopted which may result in a range of refund obligations in excess of the amount accrued considering the rehearing request and alternative calculation methodologies the potential customer refund amount could range from 10 million to 130 million for the second and final pilot rdm period 

the primary uncertainties involved in the calculation methodologies of the pilot rdm for both reconciliation periods include customer class groupings and treatment of fixed customer charges the company believes that the calculation methodology used and the resulting refund estimates recorded follow the requirements and intent of the mpsc orders and represent the most probable amount of detroit edisons pilot rdm refund liability as of december 31 2011 an mpsc order 

on the initial filing is expected in the first half of 2012 detroit edison is required to file an application with the mpsc for approval of its rdm reconciliation for the 2011 reconciliation period by may 2012 a newly designed rdm will be in effect beginning april 2012 

see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

derivatives and hedging activities 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by detroit edison and michcon meet the criteria specified for this exception 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the company and our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2011  and 2010  management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our forward contracts see sensitivity analysis in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and managements assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances as a result of the reduction in past due receivables in 2011 and further refinements to our reserve studies our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased significantly from the 2010 balance we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates as part of the 2005 gas rate order for michcon the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses the mpsc provided for a similar tracking mechanism for detroit edison in its rate order received january 2010 however it was terminated effective with the electric rate order in october 2011 

asset impairments 

goodwill 

certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations we perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in performing step 1 of the impairment test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

for step 1 of the test we estimate the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance we also employ marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

we performed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2011 and determined that no impairment existed we also compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows 

as of october 1 2011 valuation date 



 



the gas utility reporting unit passed step 1 of the impairment test however further declines in market multiples negative regulatory actions or other disruptions in cash flows for the gas utility reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the foreseeable future for example at the current discount rate and holding all other variables constant a 15x decrease in the terminal multiple would lower the fair value by approximately 423 million at the lower fair value the gas utility reporting unit would likely fail step 1 of the test potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill following completion of the step 2 analysis 

we perform an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

longlived assets 

we evaluate the carrying value of our longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require us to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact our earnings see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

pension and postretirement costs 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the company the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required we consider historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

we had pension costs of 172 million in 2011 112 million in 2010 and 58 million in 2009 postretirement benefits costs were 122 million in 2011 164 million in 2010 and 205 million in 2009 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2011 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 85 for pension plan assets and 875 for postretirement health and life plan assets in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumptions we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets our 2012 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47 in equity markets 25 in fixed income markets and 28 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we are lowering our longterm rate of return assumption for our pension plans and our postretirement health and life plans to 825 for 2012 we believe this rate is a reasonable assumption for the longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2012 given our investment strategy we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for our pension plans we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2011 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net losses as of december 31 2011 we had 100 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for our postretirement benefit plans we use fair value when determining the mrv of postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased to 50 at december 31 2011 from 55 at december 31 2010 we estimate that our 2012 total pension costs will approximate 215 million compared to 172 million in 2011 primarily due to a lower discount rate lower expected return on assets and higher amortization of net actuarial losses partially offset by 2012 contributions our 2012 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 155 million compared to 122 million in 2011 primarily due to a lower discount rate lower expected return on plan assets higher amortization of net actuarial losses and updated assumed longterm retiree medical inflation partially offset by favorable retiree medical utilization our health care trend rate assumes 700 for 2012 through 2016 650 in 2017 600 in 2018 550 in 2019 and 500 in 2020 and beyond future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of michcons negative pension expense michcon records a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2011 pension costs by approximately 29 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2011 pension costs by approximately 7 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2011 by approximately 24 million 

the value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets was 39 billion at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 our pension plans were underfunded by 13 billion and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 15 billion the 2011 and 2010 funding levels were generally similar due to plan sponsor contributions 

in 2011 and 2010 largely offset by the decreased discount rates 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets we made contributions to our pension plans of 200 million in 2011 and 200 million in 2010 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making contributions to our pension plans of 240 million in 2012 and up to 11 billion over the next five years we made postretirement benefit plan contributions of 111 million and 160 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in our utilities base rates as a result we contributed 140 million to our postretirement plans in january 2012 and expect to make up to an additional 120 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2012 and subject to mpsc funding requirements up to 855 million over the next five years the planned contributions will be made in cash dte energy common stock or a combination of cash and stock 

effective in june 2011 we discontinued offering future greater michigan represented employees a defined benefit pension plan benefit in its place the company will annually contribute an amount equivalent to four percent of an employees eligible pay to the employees defined contribution retirement savings plan also for future greater michigan represented employees after completion of one year of service in lieu of offering postemployment health care and life insurance benefits the company will contribute an amount equivalent to an additional four percent of an employees eligible pay to the employees defined contribution retirement savings plan plus a onetime contribution of 1400 

effective january 1 2012 we discontinued offering future nonrepresented employees a cash balance retirement plan benefit in its place the company will annually contribute an amount equivalent to four percent of an employees eligible pay to the employees defined contribution retirement savings plan also effective january 1 2012 in lieu of offering future nonrepresented employees postemployment health care and life insurance benefits the company will allocate 4000 per year to an account in a taxexempt trust for each employee the accumulated balance and earnings in an employees account will vest when the employee has 10 years of service regardless of age these funds will be available to the employee to use for health care expenses after the employee leaves the company 

see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

legal reserves 

we are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us 

insured and uninsured risks 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure the maximum selfinsured retention for various risks is as follows property damage 10 million general liability 7 million workers’ compensation 9 million and auto liability7 million we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported ibnr liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate as of december 31 2011 this ibnr liability was approximately 39 million 

accounting for tax obligations 

we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold we also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken we also assess 

our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that we believe will be realized in future periods we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 are appropriately accounted the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

fair value 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative gas storage transportation and power contracts which are subject to accrual accounting consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in dte energy’s reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

the company manages its marktomarket mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the company has established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following tables provide details on changes in our mtm net asset or liability position during 2011 



the table below shows the maturity of our mtm positions 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market price risk 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

the electric and gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations however the company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the gas utility gas utility manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the company is exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

our gas storage and pipelines business segment has limited exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and manages its exposure through the sale of longterm storage and transportation contracts 

our unconventional gas production business segment has exposure to natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil price fluctuations these commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations to manage this exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts 

our power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity natural gas coal and coalbased product price risk and other risks associated with the weakened us economy to the extent that commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of longterm contracts we manage this exposure using forward energy capacity and futures contracts 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

the company purchases and sells electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to governmental entities and numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail financial and other industries certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss the company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

other 

michcon has an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that enables it to recover or refund 80 percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense each year and the level established in its last rate case detroit edison had an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which was terminated in detroit edisons october 2011 electric rate order the uncollectible expense tracking mechanisms require annual reconciliation proceedings before the mpsc see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

trading activities 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2011 



 

 interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2011 we had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately 10 percent excluding securitized debt 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we have entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through july 2015 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt obligations and foreign currency exchange forward contracts the commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange risk listed below principally relate to our energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2011 and 2010 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values 

the results of the sensitivity analysis calculations as of december 31 2011 and 2010

corporate structure 

 

based on the following structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance see note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for financial information by segment for the last three years 

 

electric utility 

 

  

gas utility 

 

 5 

 

nonutility operations 

 

  

corporate  other  includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

 

 

refer to our management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report for an indepth analysis of each segment’s financial results a description of each business unit follows 

 

electric utility 

 

description 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison our generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdnre electricity is generated from our several fossil plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant and a nuclear plant and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to three major classes of customers residential commercial and industrial principally throughout southeastern michigan 

 

revenue by service 

 

 

 

 

 6 

 

weather economic factors competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on detroit edison 

 

fuel supply and purchased power 

 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have longterm and shortterm contracts for a total purchase of approximately 30 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2011 through 2013 and approximately 5 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2011 through 2012 all of these contracts have pricing schedules we have approximately 98 of our 2011 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have our expected western rail requirements under contract for the next five years all of our eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2012 and approximately 50 of this requirement is under contract in 2013 our expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities are under contract through 2014 

 

detroit edison participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead realtime and ftr basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles 

 

in 2008 a renewable portfolio standard was established for michigan electric providers targeting 10 of electricity sold to retail customers from renewable energy by 2015 detroit edison has approximately 251 mw of renewable energy under contract at december 31 2010 representing approximately 4 of electricity sold to retail customers approximately 40 mw is in commercial operation at december 31 2010 with an additional 211 mw expected in commercial operation in 2011 or early 2012 

 

properties 

 

detroit edison owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2010 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

detroit edison owns and operates 674 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33585000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 412100 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 23849000 kva 

 

circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2010 

 

 

there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between detroit edison and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission an unrelated company and connect to neighboring energy companies 

 

regulation 

 

detroit edison’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edison’s nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

 

see notes 4 9 12 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

energy assistance programs 

 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to detroit edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses detroit edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

 

strategy and competition 

 

we strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast michigan we can accomplish this goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable lowcost supplier of electricity to ensure generation and network reliability we continue to make capital investments in our generating plants and distribution system which will improve plant availability operating efficiencies and environmental compliance in areas that have a positive impact on reliability with the goal of high customer satisfaction 

 

our distribution operations focus on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service we seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report we are minimizing the impacts of changes in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes 

 

the electric customer choice program in michigan allows all of our electric customers to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers of generation services subject to limits customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10 of retail sales in 2010 and 3 of retail sales in 2009 and 2008 customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose mpscauthorized full service rates exceed their cost of service mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are adjusting the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 cap on the total potential customer choice related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric customer choice on our financial performance in addition we have a choice incentive mechanism which is an overunder recovery mechanism that measures nonfuel revenues lost or gained as a result of fluctuations in electric customer choice sales if annual electric customer choice sales exceed the baseline amount from detroit edison’s most recent rate case 90 percent of its lost nonfuel revenues associated with sales above that level may be recovered from full service customers if annual electric customer choice sales decrease below the baseline the company must refund 90 percent of its increase in nonfuel revenues associated with sales below that level to full service customers we expect that in 2011 customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

 

gas utility 

 

description 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

 

revenue by service 

 

 

 

  

our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter we are minimizing the impacts of changes in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes 

 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas utility segment 

 

natural gas supply 

 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 24 bcf with approximately 65 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2010 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply 

requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to the new york mercantile exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with mpsc approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2014 

 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions our primary longterm transportation supply contracts are as follows 

 

 

 

properties 

 

we own distribution storage and transportation properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1036000 service lines and approximately 1319000 active meters we own approximately 2000 miles of transportation lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

 

we own properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 134 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties most of our distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by us through easements permits or licenses substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

 

we own 602 miles of transportation and gathering nonutility pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of michigan we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the report 

 

regulation 

 

michcon’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters michcon’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments michcon operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff 

 

michcon also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc the ferc’s jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates nondiscriminatory requirements and terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by michcon in interstate markets ferc granted michcon authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at marketbased rates michcon provides transportation services in interstate commerce at costbased rates approved by the mpsc and filed with the ferc 

 

we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

 

see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

energy assistance program 

 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses michcon’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas in michigan we expect future sales volumes to decline as a result of economic conditions a decrease in the number of customers reduced natural gas usage by customers due to more efficient furnaces and appliances and an increased emphasis on conservation of energy usage we are minimizing the impacts of changes in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

 

our extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled us to market 400 to 500 bcf annually for intermediate storage and transportation services for michigan gas producers marketers distribution companies and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

 

michcon’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to michcon’s customers as well as sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three years prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and natural gas pricing 

 

gas storage and pipelines 

 

description 

 

gas storage and pipelines owns partnership interests in two interstate transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage fields the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by longterm fixedprice revenue contracts we have a partnership interest in vector pipeline vector an interstate transportation pipeline which connects michigan to chicago and ontario we also hold partnership interests in millennium pipeline company which indirectly connects southern new york state to upper midwestcanadian supply while providing transportation service into the new york city markets we have storage assets in michigan capable of storing up to 90 bcf in natural gas storage fields located in southeast michigan the washington 10 and 28 storage facilities are high deliverability storage fields having bidirectional interconnections with vector pipeline and michcon providing our customers access to the chicago michigan other midwest and ontario markets our customers include various utilities pipelines and producers and marketers 

properties 

 

the gas storage and pipelines business holds the following property 

 

 

 

the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations pursuant to an operating agreement michcon provides physical operations maintenance and technical support for the washington 28 and washington 10 storage facilities 

 

regulation 

 

the gas storage and pipelines business operates natural gas storage facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and related services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff we also provide interstate services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc vector and millennium pipelines provide interstate transportation services in accordance with their fercapproved tariffs 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan by expanding existing assets and developing new assets that are typically supported with longterm customer commitments the gas storage and pipelines business focuses on asset development opportunities in the midwesttonortheast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand we expect much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the us to occur within the midatlantic and new england regions we forecast these regions will require incremental pipeline and gas storage infrastructure necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet growing demand vector is an interstate pipeline that is filling a large portion of that need and is complemented by our michigan storage facilities due to the proximity of the millennium pipeline to the marcellus shale in southern new yorknorthern pennsylvania we anticipate that the millennium pipeline may have opportunities to expand in the future 

 

unconventional gas production 

 

description 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas and oil exploration development and production primarily within the barnett shale in north texas our acreage covers an area that produces high btu gas which provides a significant contribution to revenues from the value of natural gas liquids extracted from the gas stream during this period of low natural gas prices these natural gas liquids with prices correlated to crude oil prices have provided a significant increase to our realized wellhead price our drilling efforts this year have and will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil producing locations total capital investment of 26 million and production of 5 bcfe remained consistent with 2009 we executed on leasing opportunities to optimize our existing portfolio by acquiring acreage at attractive prices in 2010 bringing our total net acreage position to 70246 acres net of impairments and expirations 

properties and other 

 

the following information pertains to our interests in the barnett shale as of december 31 

 

 

 

 

  

strategy and competition 

 

outlook — in the longerterm we plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties when conditions are appropriate our strategy for 2011 is to maintain our focus on reducing operating expenses and optimizing production volume given the current outlook of low natural gas prices drilling efforts will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil production during 2011 we expect total capital investment of 25 million to drill approximately 20 new wells and continue to acquire select acreage and achieve production of approximately 6 bcfe of natural gas compared with 5 bcfe in 2010 

 

we manage and operate our properties to maximize returns on investment and increase earnings we expect to continue acquiring additional acreage at attractive prices providing opportunities to create value at low cost we will target properties with liquids rich gas and oil potential and our drilling efforts will continue to be focused on these areas due to increased activity in other shale plays throughout the country the availability of service providers has decreased somewhat however we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our drilling plans or operations since most oilfield services have been secured for the next 12 months 

 

from time to time we may use financial derivative contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas and oil on our forecasted sales volume at december 31 2010 we had no longterm fixed 

price contracts relating to natural gas and had the following financial contracts in place with our energy trading affiliate related to our projected oil production

wholesale power and renewables we own and operate three biomassfired electric generating plants with a capacity of 133 mws we own two coalfired power plants currently undergoing conversions to biomass with expected inservice dates of the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2013 we own one gasfired peaking electric generating plant the electric output is sold under long term power purchase agreements we also develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy in addition to providing environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

 

reduced emission fuel we deliver reduced emission fuel to utilities with coalfired electric generation power plants we own and operate five facilities that process raw coal into reduced emission fuel resulting in reductions in nitrogen oxide no and mercury hg emissions we began generating production tax credits from these facilities beginning in 2009 which will continue through 2019 upon achieving certain criteria including entering into transactions with unrelated equity partners or thirdparty customers for the reduced emission fuel we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at detroit edison sites and intend to relocate other facilities to alternative sites which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2011 and future years in january 2011 the company entered into an agreement to sell a membership interest in one of these reduced emission fuel facilities that is located at a detroit edison site 

 

coal services the business provides coal transportation and related services including fuel to our customers with significant energy requirements which include electric utilities merchant power producers integrated steel mills and large industrial companies we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for those energyintensive customers we own and operate a coal transloading terminal which provides storage and blending for our customers we also engage in coal marketing which includes the marketing and trading of physical coal and coal financial instruments and forward contracts for the purchase and sale of emission allowances 

properties and other 

 

the following are significant properties operated by the power and industrial projects segment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

regulation 

 

certain electric generating facilities within power and industrial projects have marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power the facilities are subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules certain power and industrial projects are also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

strategy and competition 

 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel renewable power onsite energy coal marketing storage and blending landfill gas recovery and reduced emission fuel businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services 

 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment new and pending legislation the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our interrelated businesses as we expand as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 

  

our coal transportation and marketing business will continue to leverage its existing business in 2011 trends such as railroad and mining consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing new mines could have an impact on how we compete in the future effective january 1 2011 our existing longterm rail transportation contract at rates significantly below the current market expired and we anticipate a decrease in transportationrelated revenue of approximately 130 million as a result we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers 

 

energy trading 

 

description 

 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities these financial instruments are generally accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

 

significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the segment’s strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 

 

regulation 

 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and blanket authority from the ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market 

behavior rules energy trading is also subject to the applicable laws rules and regulations related to the commodity futures trading commission us department of homeland security and department of energy 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric and gas marketers financial institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating the company believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities we monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that our commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations 

 

 

 

air — detroit edison is subject to the epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions further additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

 

in july 2009 dte energy received a notice of violationfinding of violation novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five detroit edison power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and operating permit requirements under the clean air act an additional novfov was received in june 2010 related to a recent project and outage at unit 2 of the monroe power plant 

on august 5 2010 the united states department of justice at the request of the epa brought a civil suit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against dte energy and detroit edison related to the june 2010 novfov and the outage work performed at unit 2 of the monroe power plant but not relating to the july 2009 novfov among other relief the epa requested the court to require detroit edison to install and operate the best available control technology at unit 2 of the monroe power plant further the epa requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require detroit edison to i begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the monroe unit 2 modification and ii offset the pollution from monroe unit 2 through emissions reductions from detroit edison’s fleet of coalfired power plants until the new control equipment is operating in january 2011 the epa’s motion for preliminary injunction was denied and the liability phase of the civil suit has been scheduled for trial in may 2011 

 

dte energy and detroit edison believe that the plants identified by the epa including unit 2 of the monroe power plant have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations depending upon the outcome of discussions with the epa regarding the novfov and the result of the civil action the company could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines the company cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution 

 

water  — in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes initially it was estimated that detroit edison could incur up to approximately 55 million in additional capital expenditures over the four to six years subsequent to 2008 to comply with these requirements however a january 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation that has resulted in a delay in compliance dates the decision also raised the possibility that detroit edison may have to install cooling towers at some facilities at a cost substantially greater than was initially estimated for other mitigative technologies in 2008 the supreme court agreed to review the remanded costbenefit analysis provision of the rule and in april 2009 upheld the epa’s use of this provision in determining best technology available for reducing environmental impacts concurrently the epa continues to develop a revised rule a draft of which is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2011 with a final rule scheduled for mid2012 the epa has also issued an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines it is not possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing requirements 

 

manufactured gas plant mgp and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites gas utility owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites detroit edison owns or previously owned three former mgp sites in addition to the mgp sites we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 

 

any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect the company’s financial position and cash flows the company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for michcon which allows michcon to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for citizens fuel gas approved by the city of adrian will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

 

landfill  — detroit edison owns and operates a permitted engineered ash storage facility at the monroe power plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant detroit edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and reconstruction 

the epa has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash under the authority of the resources conservation and recovery act rcra the proposed rule published on june 21 2010 contains two primary regulatory options to regulate coal ash residue the epa is currently considering either to designate coal ash as a “hazardous waste” as defined by rcra or to regulate coal ash as nonhazardous waste under rcra however agencies and legislatures have urged the epa to regulate coal ash as a nonhazardous waste if the epa were to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste the agency could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

 

nonutility 

 

the company’s nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants 

 

the michigan coke battery facility received and responded to information requests from the epa that resulted in the issuance of a notice of violation in june of 2007 alleging potential maximum achievable control technologies and new source review violations the epa is in the process of reviewing the company’s position of demonstrated compliance and has not initiated escalated enforcement at this time the company cannot predict the impact of this issue furthermore the michigan coke battery facility is the subject of an investigation by the mdnre concerning visible emissions readings that resulted from the company self reporting to the mdnre questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by the company to perform the visible emissions readings at this time the company cannot predict the impact of this investigation 

 

the company is also in the process of settling historical air and water violations at its coke battery facility located in pennsylvania at this time the company cannot predict the impact of this settlement the company received two notices of violation from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection in 2010 alleging violations of the permit for the pennsylvania coke battery facility in connection with coal pile storm water runoff the company has implemented best management practices to address this issue and is currently seeking a permit from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection to upgrade its wastewater treatment technology to a biological treatment facility the company’s nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements other than as noted above 

 

global climate change 

 

climate regulation andor legislation is being proposed and discussed within the us congress and the epa despite passage of a greenhouse gas cap and trade bill by the us house in june 2009 the senate has been unable to pass a similar climate bill a greenhouse gas cap and trade program is not expected to be included in energy or climate bills to be considered by the 112th congress meanwhile the epa is beginning to implement regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emission of greenhouse gases the epa regulation of greenhouse gases ghgs begins in 2011 requiring the best available control technology bact for major sources or modifications to existing major sources that cause significant increases in ghg emissions the impact of this rule is uncertain until bact is better defined by the permitting agencies pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable andor nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments it is not possible to quantify these impacts on dte energy or its customers at this time 

 

see notes 12 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report 

employees 

 

we had approximately 9800 employees as of december 31 2010 of which approximately 5000 were represented by unions there are several bargaining units for the company’s represented employees in the 2010 third quarter a new threeyear agreement was ratified covering approximately 3800 represented employees the majority of the remaining represented employees are under contracts that expire in june 2011 and august 2012

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energy’s utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our utility and nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve our utilities and certain nonutility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel industries which have undergone considerable financial distress exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions should national or regional economic conditions further decline reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services we supply collections of accounts receivable and potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas could result in decreased earnings and cash flow 

 

we are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we do business adverse economic conditions affecting or financial difficulties of counterparties with whom we do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their contractual obligations or cause them to delay such payments or obligations we depend on these counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers’ rates our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers’ rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations the state of michigan elected a new governor and legislature in november 2010 and we cannot predict whether the resulting changes in political conditions will affect the regulations or interpretations affecting our utilities new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses 

 

we may be required to refund amounts we collect under selfimplemented rates michigan law allows our utilities to selfimplement base rate changes six months after a rate filing subject to certain limitations however if the final rate case order provides for lower rates than we have selfimplemented we must refund the difference with interest we have selfimplemented rates in the past and have been ordered to make refunds to customers our financial performance may be negatively affected if the mpsc sets lower rates in future rate cases than those we have selfimplemented thereby requiring us to issue refunds we cannot predict what rates an mpsc order will adopt in future rate cases 

 

michigan’s electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the electric customer choice program as originally contemplated in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates in addition such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers mpsc rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a cap on the total 

potential customer choice related migration however even with the electric customer choicerelated relief received in recent detroit edison rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation in the electric customer choice program there continues to be financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes 

 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities based on these regulations additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented the operations of our fossilfuel generation assets and our unconventional gas production assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us regional and national economic condition s  increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact our liquidity 

 

our ability to access capital markets is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses in the past turmoil in credit markets has constrained and may again in the future constrain our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets we have substantial amounts of credit facilities that expire in 2012 and 2013 we intend to seek to renew the facilities on or before the expiration dates however we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts which could result in a decrease in amounts available andor an increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our financial performance 

 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations our costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase 

potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from detroit edison or michcon customers the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

 

weather significantly affects operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process 

 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance 

 

construction and capital improvements to our power facilities subject us to risk we are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities many factors that could cause delay or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits construction disputes and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities 

 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers we have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of energy also impacts the market for our nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

 

the supply andor price of other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of our facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses 

 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to 

make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

 

our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change while great care is exercised in utilizing historical information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of future production and cash flow we cannot provide absolute assurance that our estimates of our barnett gas reserves are accurate we estimate proved gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves including factors beyond our control reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves or of cash flows attributable to such reserves is a function of the available data assumptions regarding expenditures for future development and exploration activities and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment additionally reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history development and exploration activities and prices of gas actual future production revenue taxes development expenditures operating expenses quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information we used 

 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources we have generated production tax credits from coke production landfill gas recovery biomass fired electric generation reduced emission fuel steel industry fuel and gas production operations all production tax credits taken after 2008 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows 

 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business we are subject to michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy under the current michigan legislation we will be required in the future to provide a specified percentage of our power from michigan renewable energy sources we are developing a strategy for complying with the existing state legislation but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation we are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and identifying third party projects in which we can invest we cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with these future projects 

 

we are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage we do not know how these programs will impact our business and future operating results 

 

threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our business we may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite our implementation of security measures all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes if our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

in addition our generation plants gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products we have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements we routinely have speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines we set resulting from the management of our business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position we manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 

 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations 

 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers shareholders and employees our customers shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information and the united states regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or dte energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

 

a work interruption may adversely affect us unions represent approximately 5000 of our employees a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

 

failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in certain legal regulatory administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings include certain contract disputes environmental reviews and investigations audits inquiries from various regulators and pending judicial matters we cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings we regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss the resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in the periods they are resolved 

 

in february 2008 dte energy was named as one of approximately 24 defendant oil power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in a united states district court dte energy was served with process in march 2008 the plaintiffs the native village of kivalina and city of kivalina which are home to approximately 400 people in alaska claim that the defendants’ business activities have contributed to global warming and as a result higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall and winter as a result the plaintiffs are seeking damages of up to 400 million for relocation costs associated with moving the village to a safer location as well as unspecified attorney’s fees and expenses on october 15 2009 the us district court granted defendants’ motions dismissing all of plaintiffs’ federal claims in the case on two 

independent grounds 1 the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claims because of the political question doctrine and 2 plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims the court also dismissed plaintiffs’ state law claims because the court lacked supplemental jurisdiction over them after it dismissed the federal claims the dismissal of the state law claims was without prejudice the plaintiffs have appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 

 

in july 2009 dte energy received a notice of violationfinding of violation novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five of detroit edison’s power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and operating permit requirements under the clean air act in june 2010 the epa issued a novfov making similar allegations related to a recent project and outage at unit 2 of the monroe power plant 

 

on august 5 2010 the united states department of justice at the request of the epa brought a civil suit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against dte energy and detroit edison related to the june 2010 novfov and the outage work performed at unit 2 of the monroe power plant but not relating to the july 2009 novfov among other relief the epa requested the court to require detroit edison to install and operate the best available control technology at unit 2 of the monroe power plant further the epa requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require detroit edison to i begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the monroe unit 2 modification and ii offset the pollution from monroe unit 2 through emissions reductions from detroit edison’s fleet of coalfired power plants until the new control equipment is operating in january 2011 the epa’s motion for preliminary injunction was denied and the liability phase of the civil suit has been scheduled for trial in may 2011 

 

dte energy and detroit edison believe that the plants identified by the epa including unit 2 of the monroe power plant have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations depending upon the outcome of discussions with the epa regarding the novfov and the result of the civil action detroit edison could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines dte energy and detroit edison cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution 

 

in october 2010 the company received a notice of violation from the mdnre alleging that the michigan coke battery facility violated the visible emission readings and quench water sampling requirements under applicable national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants regulations this notice of violation resulted from the company self reporting to the mdnre and the epa questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by the company to perform visible emissions readings and quench water sampling the information provided by contractor was used by the company in filing certain reports with the mdnre and the epa the company has ceased using the contractor for these activities has retained a new certified contractor to perform the required activities and implemented standard operating procedures designed to prevent a reoccurrence of such a situation at this time the company cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this issue 

 

in december 2010 the company received a notice of violation from the detroit water and sewerage department dwsd alleging that effluent discharges from the michigan coke battery facility violated the city of detroit ordinance the general pretreatment standards and the terms of a consent judgment entered between the company and the dwsd with respect to the michigan coke battery facility in march 2009 the company has settled similar alleged violations with respect to the michigan coke battery facility with the dwsd in the past the company has installed a biological waste water treatment plant at the michigan coke battery facility in accordance with the consent judgement that is designed to meet the effluent limitations and is in the process of optimizing plant performance to minimize any future excursions of the ordinance and the general pretreatment standards the dwsd has demanded payment of 176000 in penalties in connection with the alleged violations the company is actively pursuing a settlement with dwsd but we cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter 

 

in april 2006 the prior owners of the coke battery facility in pennsylvania that the company purchased in 2008 received a notice of violationfinding of violation from the epa alleging violations of the lowest achievable emission rate requirements associated with visible emissions from the combustion stack door leaks and charging activities at the coke battery facility the epa has also alleged certain violations of the clean water act but has not 

issued a notice of violation in connection with these alleged violations the company is in the process of negotiating a consent order with the epa to settle these historic air and water issues the company will be required to complete ceramic welding repairs to the coke battery facility and to make repairs to the waste water treatment facility at the coke battery facility the company will also be required to pay a fine in connection with the settlement of these historic violations at this time the company cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this settlement or the timing of its resolution

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2010 operating revenues in excess of 8 billion and approximately 25 billion in assets we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout southeastern michigan we operate four energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

 

 

the increase in 2010 net income attributable to dte energy as compared to 2009 was primarily due to improved results in the electric and gas utilities and in the power and industrial projects segment partially offset by lower earnings in energy trading the decrease in net income attributable to dte energy in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to an 80 million aftertax gain recorded in the unconventional gas production segment on the 2008 sale of a portion of barnett shale properties partially offset by higher earnings in the electric utility and energy trading segments 

 

the items discussed below influenced our current financial performance andor may affect future results 

 

  

reference in this report to “we” “us” “our” “company” or “dte” are to dte energy and its subsidiaries collectively 

 

utility operations 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison which is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 21 million customers in southeastern michigan 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transportation gathering distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 12 million customers throughout michigan citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

 

detroit edison has experienced decreased electric sales in 2010 driven primarily by a decrease in commercial sales partially offset by higher residential and industrial sales commercial sales continue to be lower due primarily to customers participating in the electric customer choice program the residential sales increase is a result of warmer summer weather industrial sales are higher due to increased demand from customers in the automotive and steel industries and their related suppliers and other ancillary businesses the impact of customers participating in the electric customer choice program is mitigated by the cim an overunder recovery mechanism which measures nonfuel revenues that are lost or gained as a result of fluctuations in electric customer choice sales if annual electric customer choice sales exceed the baseline amount from detroit edison’s most recent rate case 90 percent 

of its lost nonfuel revenues associated with sales above that level may be recovered from full service customers if annual electric customer choice sales decrease below the baseline the company must refund 90 percent of its increase in nonfuel revenues associated with sales below that level to full service customers michcon’s sales were lower due primarily to a decrease in the number of customers reduced natural gas usage by customers due to economic conditions and an increased emphasis on conservation of energy usage 

 

we have rdms in place at both utilities the rdms are designed to minimize the impact on revenues of changes in average customer usage of electricity and natural gas the january 2010 mpsc order in detroit edison’s 2009 rate case provided for among other items the implementation of a pilot electric rdm effective february 1 2010 the electric rdm enables detroit edison to recover or refund the change in revenue resulting from the difference between actual average sales per customer compared to the base level of average sales per customer established in the mpsc order the june 2010 mpsc order in michcon’s 2009 rate case provided for among other items the implementation of a pilot gas rdm effective july 1 2010 the gas rdm enables michcon to recover or refund the change in revenue resulting from the difference in weatheradjusted average sales per customer compared to the base average sales per customer established in the mpsc order the rdms for detroit edison and michcon address changes in customer usage due to general economic conditions and conservation but do not shield the utilities from the impacts of lost customers in addition the pilot electric rdm materially shields detroit edison from the impact of weather on customer usage the pilot gas rdm does not shield michcon from the impact of weather on customer usage the electric and gas rdms are subject to review by the mpsc after the initial oneyear pilot programs 

 

both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables primarily attributable to economic conditions our service territories continue to experience high levels of unemployment underemployment and low income households home foreclosures and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers we have taken actions to manage the level of past due receivables including customer assistance forums contracting with collection agencies working with michigan officials and others to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers and increasing customer disconnections as a result of actions taken to manage the level of past due receivables arrears were reduced in 2010 in our electric and gas utilities detroit edison has an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that enables it to recover or refund 80 percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each year and the 66 million level reflected in base rates in the june 2010 mpsc rate order the base amount of michcon’s uncollectible expense tracking mechanism was increased prospectively from 37 million to 70 million and michcon’s portion of recovery or refund of the expenses above or below the base amount was modified to 80 percent from 90 percent the detroit edison and michcon uncollectible tracking mechanisms require annual reconciliation proceedings before the mpsc 

 

 

 

we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow at our utility operations through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects we are actively managing our cash capital expenditures cost structure and liquidity to maintain our financial strength see the capital resources and liquidity section in this management’s discussion and analysis for further discussion of our liquidity outlook 

 

nonutility operations 

 

we have significant investments in nonutility businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets skills and expertise specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile we expect growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments in the future expansion of these businesses will also result in our ability to further diversify geographically 

gas storage and pipelines owns partnership interests in two natural gas storage fields and two interstate pipelines serving the midwest ontario and northeast markets much of the growth in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the eastern canada and the northeast us regions our vector and millennium pipelines are well positioned to provide access routes and lowcost expansion options to these markets in addition millennium pipeline is well positioned for growth related to the marcellus shale especially with respect to marcellus production in northern pennsylvania and along the southern tier of new york 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas and oil exploration development and production primarily within the barnett shale in north texas our acreage covers an area that produces high btu gas which provides a significant contribution to revenues from the value of natural gas liquids extracted from the gas stream during this period of low natural gas prices these natural gas liquids with prices correlated to crude oil prices have provided a significant increase to our realized wellhead price our drilling efforts have and will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil producing locations we continue to develop our holdings and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties when conditions are appropriate 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation marketing and trading services and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects this business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries renewable energy environmental and economic trends are creating growth opportunities the increasing number of states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides the opportunity to market the expertise of the power and industrial projects segment in renewable power generation landfill gas recovery reduced emission fuel and other related services 

 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf 

 

capital investments 

 

we anticipate significant capital investments during the next three years concentrated primarily in detroit edison 

 

 

 

our utility businesses require significant capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of their asset bases including power generation plants distribution systems storage fields and other facilities and fleets for both detroit edison and michcon we plan to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior general rate case filing treatment detroit edison is required to implement a 20year renewable energy plan to address the provisions of michigan public act 295 of 2008 with the goals of delivering cleaner renewable electric generation to its customers further diversifying detroit edison’s and the state of michigan’s sources of electric supply and addressing the state and national goals of increasing energy independence detroit edison will seek separate regulatory approval and recovery of these renewable capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base through our renewable energy plan filings 

 

in april 2010 the company signed an agreement with the us department of energy for a grant of approximately 84 million in matching funds on total anticipated spending of approximately 168 million related to the accelerated deployment of smart grid technology in michigan through 2012 the smart grid technology includes 

the establishment of an advanced metering infrastructure and other technologies that address improved electric distribution service see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

nonutility investments are expected primarily in continued investment in gas storage and pipeline assets and renewable opportunities in the power and industrial projects businesses 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers 

 

air — detroit edison is subject to the epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements detroit edison has spent approximately 15 billion through 2010 the company estimates detroit edison will make capital expenditures of over 230 million in 2011 and up to 21 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2020 based on current regulations further additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

 

in july 2009 dte energy received a notice of violationfinding of violation novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five detroit edison power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and operating permit requirements under the clean air act an additional novfov was received in june 2010 related to a recent project and outage at unit 2 of the monroe power plant 

 

on august 5 2010 the united states department of justice at the request of the epa brought a civil suit in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against dte energy and detroit edison related to the june 2010 novfov and the outage work performed at unit 2 of the monroe power plant but not relating to the july 2009 novfov among other relief the epa requested the court to require detroit edison to install and operate the best available control technology at unit 2 of the monroe power plant further the epa requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require detroit edison to i begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the monroe unit 2 modification and ii offset the pollution from monroe unit 2 through emissions reductions from detroit edison’s fleet of coalfired power plants until the new control equipment is operating in january 2011 the epa’s motion for preliminary injunction was denied and the liability phase of the civil suit has been scheduled for trial in may 2011 

 

dte energy and detroit edison believe that the plants identified by the epa including unit 2 of the monroe power plant have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations depending upon the outcome of discussions with the epa regarding the novfov and the result of the civil action the company could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines the company cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution 

 

water  — in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes initially it was estimated that detroit edison could incur up to approximately 55 million in additional capital expenditures over the four to six years subsequent to 2008 to comply with these requirements however a january 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation that has resulted in a delay in compliance dates the decision also raised the 

possibility that detroit edison may have to install cooling towers at some facilities at a cost substantially greater than was initially estimated for other mitigative technologies in 2008 the supreme court agreed to review the remanded costbenefit analysis provision of the rule and in april 2009 upheld the epa’s use of this provision in determining best technology available for reducing environmental impacts the epa continues to develop a revised rule a draft of which is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2011 with a final rule scheduled for mid2012 the epa has also issued an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines it is not possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing requirements 

 

manufactured gas plant mgp and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas have been designated as mgp sites gas utility owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites detroit edison owns or previously owned three former mgp sites in addition to the mgp sites we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 

 

any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect the company’s financial position and cash flows the company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the mpsc for michcon which allows michcon to amortize the mgp costs over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the mgp costs were incurred and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for citizens fuel gas approved by the city of adrian will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

 

landfill  — detroit edison owns and operates a permitted engineered ash storage facility at the monroe power plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant detroit edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and reconstruction 

 

the epa has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash under the authority of the resources conservation and recovery act rcra the proposed rule published on june 21 2010 contains two primary regulatory options to regulate coal ash residue the epa is currently considering either to designate coal ash as a “hazardous waste” as defined by rcra or to regulate coal ash as non hazardous waste under rcra however agencies and legislatures have urged the epa to regulate coal ash as a nonhazardous waste if the epa were to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste the agency could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

 

nonutility 

 

the company’s nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants 

 

the michigan coke battery facility received and responded to information requests from the epa that resulted in the issuance of a notice of violation in june of 2007 alleging potential maximum achievable control technologies and new source review violations the epa is in the process of reviewing the company’s position of demonstrated compliance and has not initiated escalated enforcement at this time the company cannot predict the impact of this issue furthermore the michigan coke battery facility is the subject of an investigation by the mdnre concerning visible emissions readings that resulted from the company self reporting to mdnre questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by the company to perform the visible emissions readings at this time the company cannot predict the impact of this investigation 

 

the company is also in the process of settling historical air and water violations at its coke battery facility located in pennsylvania at this time the company cannot predict the impact of this settlement the company received two notices of violation from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection in 2010 alleging 

violations of the permit for the pennsylvania coke battery facility in connection with coal pile storm water runoff the company has implemented best management practices to address this issue and is currently seeking a permit from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection to upgrade its wastewater treatment technology to a biological treatment facility the company expects to spend approximately 07 million on the existing waste water treatment system to comply with existing water discharge requirements the company may spend an additional 13 million over the next few years to meet future regulatory requirements and gain other operational improvementssavings the company’s nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements other than as noted above 

 

global climate change 

 

climate regulation andor legislation is being proposed and discussed within the us congress and the epa despite passage of a greenhouse gas cap and trade bill by the us house in june 2009 the senate has been unable to pass a similar climate bill a greenhouse gas cap and trade program is not expected to be included in energy or climate bills to be considered by the 112th congress meanwhile the epa is beginning to implement regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emission of greenhouse gases the epa regulation of greenhouse gases ghgs begins in 2011 requiring the best available control technology bact for major sources or modifications to existing major sources that cause significant increases in ghg emissions the impact of this rule is uncertain until bact is better defined by the permitting agencies pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures the purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable andor nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments it is not possible to quantify these impacts on dte energy or its customers at this time 

 

outlook 

 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth 

 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 

  

we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

 

results of operations 

 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments 

 

 

 

 

  

electric utility 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison 

 

electric utility results are discussed below 

 

 

 

gross margin increased 190 million in 2010 and increased 127 million in 2009 revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statement of operations the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

operation and maintenance expense increased 28 million in 2010 and decreased 45 million in 2009 the increase in 2010 is primarily due to higher restoration and line clearance expenses of 40 million higher energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of 18 million higher legal expenses of 15 million partially offset by reduced uncollectible expenses of 20 million lower generation expenses of 18 million and lower employee benefitrelated expenses of 6 million the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to 71 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense information technology and other staff expenses 14 million of lower employee benefitrelated expenses lower restoration and line clearance expenses of 12 million 9 million of reduced uncollectible expenses and 6 million of reduced maintenance activities partially offset by higher pension and health care costs of 54 million and 14 million of energy optimization and renewable energy expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 5 million in 2010 and 101 million in 2009 due primarily to a higher depreciable base and increased amortization of regulatory assets 

 

taxes other than income were higher by 32 million in 2010 due primarily to a 30 million reduction in property tax expense in 2009 due to refunds received in settlement of appeals of assessments for prior years 

 

outlook  — we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of detroit edison the 2010 mpsc order provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which financially assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that addresses changes in average customer usage due to general economic conditions weather and conservation these and other tracking mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in lower earnings volatility we expect that our planned significant environmental and renewable expenditures will result in earnings growth looking forward we face additional challenges such as higher levels of capital spending volatility in prices for coal and other commodities increased transportation costs investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs lower levels of wholesale sales due to contract expirations and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change we expect to continue our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

 

gas utility 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

 

gas utility results are discussed below 

 

 

 

gross margin increased 47 million in 2010 and decreased 43 million in 2009 revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statement 

of operations the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

 

 

 

 

 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 37 million in 2010 and 49 million in 2009 the decrease in 2010 is primarily due to reduced uncollectible expenses of 35 million and the deferral of 32 million of previously expensed cta restructuring expenses partially offset by higher maintenance expenses of 11 million increased energy optimization expenses of 9 million higher employee benefitrelated expenses of 3 million and expense of 3 million for contributions to the low income energy efficiency fund the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to 33 million of reduced uncollectible expenses 15 million of lower employee benefitrelated expenses 14 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense information technology and other staff expenses partially offset by higher health care expenses of 8 million and 4 million of energy optimization expenses see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 15 million in 2010 due to the march 2010 mpsc order that reduced michcon’s depreciation rates effective april 1 2010 

 

asset gains losses net decreased 18 million due to 2009 gains on the sale of base gas and the sale of certain gathering and processing assets 

 

outlook — we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of gas utility unfavorable economic trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of customers in our service territory increased customer conservation and continued high levels of theft and uncollectible accounts receivable the mpsc has provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that addresses changes in average customer usage due to general economic conditions and conservation these and other tracking mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in lower earnings volatility in the future looking forward we face additional issues such as volatility in gas prices investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs we expect to continue an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity minimize lost and stolen gas and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability 

gas storage and pipelines 

 

our gas storage and pipelines segment consists of our nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses 

 

gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 

 

 

 

net income attributable to dte energy increased 2 million and 11 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the 2010 increase was driven by higher gas storage revenues and lower project development costs the 2009 increase was driven by higher operating revenues resulting from increased capacity sold and higher rates from renewing storage contracts related to longterm agreements in addition in 2009 we had higher equity earnings from our investments in the vector and millennium pipelines reflecting a first full year of operations for millennium 

 

outlook — our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan and is evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities 

 

unconventional gas production 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas and oil exploration development and production within the barnett shale in northern texas in january 2008 we sold a portion of our barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately 260 million we recognized a gain of 128 million 80 million aftertax on the sale in 2008 

 

unconventional gas production results are discussed below 

 

 

operating revenues increased 1 million in 2010 as a result of higher commodity prices and an increase in oil production the 2009 decrease of 17 million was due to lower commodity prices realized for physical sales as well as a reduction in volumes hedged 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 1 million in 2010 due to more wells on line and increased water handling cost the decrease of 7 million in 2009 was due to operational efficiencies and lower costs for goods and services due to economic conditions 

 

asset gains and losses net increased 4 million in 2010 and decreased 126 million in 2009 the increase in 2010 was due to impairment of unproved leasehold positions that the company does not intend to drill prior to expiration the 2009 decrease was due to the gain of 128 million 80 million aftertax on the 2008 sale of a portion of our barnett shale properties and 2 million lower impairment in 2009 of expired or expiring leasehold positions that the company did not intend to drill at then current commodity prices 

 

outlook — in the longerterm we plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties when conditions are appropriate our strategy for 2011 is to maintain our focus on reducing operating expenses and optimizing production volume given the current outlook of low natural gas prices drilling efforts will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil production during 2011 we expect total capital investment of 25 million to drill approximately 20 new wells and continue to acquire select acreage and achieve production of approximately 6 bcfe of natural gas compared with 5 bcfe in 2010 

 

power and industrial projects 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation services and marketing and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects 

 

power and industrial projects results are discussed below 

 

 

 

vies  — as discussed in notes 1 and 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2010 we adopted the provisions of asu 200917 amendments to fasb interpretation 46r  asu 200917 changed the methodology for determining the primary beneficiary of a vie from a quantitative risk and rewardsbased model to a qualitative determination the company reevaluated prior vie and primary beneficiary determinations and as a result began consolidating five entities since these entities were previously accounted for under the equity method the vie consolidation had no impact on net income attributable to dte energy as a 

result of the consolidation of these vies operating revenues and operations and maintenance expense increased 174 million and 122 million respectively in 2010 

 

operating revenues increased 309 million net of vie adjustments in 2010 and decreased 326 million in 2009 the 2010 increase is attributed primarily to 172 million of higher coke sales and a 156 million increase in onsite services partially offset by a 18 million decrease in coal trading and transportation services the 2009 decrease is due primarily to 111 million reduction in certain coal structured transactions 176 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and 84 million of lower coke demand partially offset by a 107 million increase in coal related services 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 262 million net of vie adjustments in 2010 and decreased 306 million in 2009 the increase is due primarily to 118 million of higher coke production and a 154 million increase in onsite services partially offset by 10 million of lower coal trading and transportation services the 2009 decrease is due primarily to 111 million decrease in certain coal structured transactions and 64 million of lower coke demand 141 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and operating expenses partially offset by 75 million of higher coal related services 

 

asset gains losses were higher by 8 million in 2010 due primarily to the sale of dte rail services and an increase in installment gains from the sale of a coke battery 

 

other income and deductions were lower by 14 million in 2010 and lower by 19 million in 2009 the decreases in both years were due primarily to lower equity earnings in various projects and higher intercompany interest associated with project investment 

 

outlook  — we expect sustained production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2011 beginning in 2011 substantially all of the metallurgical coke is under longterm contracts the tax credits associated with our steel industry fuels facilities expired at december 31 2010 that will result in lower tax credits of approximately 29 million in 2011 we supply onsite energy services to the domestic automotive manufacturers who have also experienced stabilized demand for automobiles our onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts 

 

in late 2009 we began operating reduced emission fuel facilities located at detroit edison owned coalfired power plants the facilities reduce nitrogen oxide no and mercury hg emissions and qualify for production tax credits when the fuel is sold to an unrelated party through 2019 we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at detroit edison sites and intend to relocate other facilities to alternative sites which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2011 and future years in january 2011 the company entered into an agreement to sell a membership interest in one of these reduced emission fuel facilities that is located at a detroit edison site 

 

environmental and economic trends are creating growth opportunities for renewable power the increasing number of states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides investment opportunity in wastewood power generation in addition to the three facilities in operation we will convert and place into service two additional facilities in 2011 and 2013 we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities for wastewood renewable power generation and other energy projects at favorable prices 

 

effective january 1 2011 our existing longterm rail transportation contract at rates significantly below the current market expired and we anticipate a decrease in transportationrelated revenue of approximately 130 million as a result the decrease in revenue will be mostly offset by lower variable costs incurred to provide the transportation 

 

we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers 

 

energy trading 

 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas 

pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf 

 

energy trading results are discussed below 

 

 

 

gross margin decreased 112 million in 2010 and increased 48 million in 2009 the overall decrease in gross margin in 2010 was the result of lower economic performance lower commodity prices lower volatility in the markets we participate in and lower risk positions relative to 2009 coupled with the absence of prior year timingrelated gains we experienced timingrelated earnings volatility based on market movement related to derivative contracts 

 

the decrease in 2010 represents a 78 million decrease in realized margins and 34 million decrease in unrealized margins the 78 million decrease in realized margins is due to 108 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power and gas trading and gas full requirements strategies offset by 30 million of favorable results primarily in our power full requirements and power origination strategies the 34 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to 56 million of unfavorable results primarily in our power trading strategy and the absence of prior year timingrelated gains related to our gas transportation strategy these decreases were offset by 22 million of favorable results primarily due to timingrelated gains in our gas full requirements strategy 

 

the 48 million increase in gross margin in 2009 was due to increases in realized margins of 69 million offset by decreases in unrealized margins of 21 million the 69 million increase in realized margins was primarily the result of increases in our gas trading strategy and timingrelated increases in our gas storage and gas transportation strategies the 21 million decrease in unrealized margins consisted of unfavorable results of 58 million from our gas trading and gas storage strategies partially offset by increases of 29 million primarily in our power trading strategy and timingrelated improvements of 8 million in our oil strategies 

 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 12 million in 2010 and increased 3 million in 2009 the 2010 decrease was primarily due to lower incentive costs the 2009 increase was due to higher payroll and incentive costs and commissions partially offset by lower contractor expense and allocated corporate costs 

 

income tax provision decreased 32 million in 2010 this decrease is due to lower pretax income partially offset by 10 million of favorable taxrelated adjustments in 2009 resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits income taxes were higher by 6 million in 2009 due to higher pretax income partially offset by the 10 million of favorable taxrelated adjustments 

 

outlook — in the near term we expect market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility or lack thereof in commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations 

the energy trading portfolio includes financial instruments physical commodity contracts and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generation capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas natural gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

corporate  other 

 

corporate  other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

 

the 2010 net loss of 69 million was an improvement of 1 million from the 2009 net loss of 70 million the net 1 million improvement was a result of the 2009 donation to the dte energy foundation of 10 million and lower impairments of investments of 3 million partially offset by higher state and local taxes of 3 million higher tax related interest of 5 million increased financing costs of 5 million the 2010 donation to the dte energy foundation of 14 million was made by detroit edison and michcon 

 

the 2009 net loss of 70 million decreased from the net loss of 94 million in 2008 due to 34 million favorable taxrelated adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits 10 million lower intercompany interest expense and 9 million lower costs related to natural gas forward contracts associated with the 2007 sale of the antrim shale properties these favorable variances were partially offset by a 10 million donation of cash and availableforsale securities to the dte energy foundation 10 million resulting from a realignment of employee benefit expense from michcon 7 million increase in financing fees 1 million increased impairment of investments and a 1 million decrease in interest income 

 

cumulative effect of accounting changes 

 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted asc 820 sfas no 157 fair value measurements  the cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of asc 820 represented a 4 million increase to the january 1 2008 balance of retained earnings see also the “fair value” section 

 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

cash requirements 

 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements in 2011 we expect that cash from operations will be 19 billion due to lower working capital requirements we anticipate base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2011 of up to 14 billion the capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental expenditures we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of 

existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

 

 

 

cash from operating activities 

 

a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs 

 

cash from operations totaling 18 billion in 2010 was consistent with the comparable 2009 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred income taxes and gains on sales of assets offset by higher working capital requirements 

 

cash from operations totaling 18 billion in 2009 increased 260 million from the comparable 2008 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects lower working capital requirements and higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred income taxes and gains on sales of assets 

 

cash from investing activities 

 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures in any given year we will look to realize 

cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements capital spending within our nonutility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we initially invest based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

 

net cash used for investing activities was approximately 12 billion in 2010 compared with net cash used for investing activities of 11 billion in 2009 the change was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures by our utility and nonutility businesses 

 

net cash used for investing activities was approximately 11 billion in 2009 compared with net cash used for investing activities of 15 billion in 2008 the change was primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures by our utility and nonutility businesses and the completion of refund payments to our synfuel partners in 2008 

 

cash from financing activities 

 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations 

 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 to 52 to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 586 million in 2010 compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately 789 million for the same period in 2009 the change was primarily attributable to decreased payments for shortterm borrowings increases in issuances of longterm debt were offset by increased longterm debt redemptions 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 789 million in 2009 compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately 84 million for the same period in 2008 the change was primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

 

outlook 

 

we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and the nonutility businesses we expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined our nonutility growth is expected from additional investments in energy projects as economic conditions improve 

 

we may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects 

 

we have approximately 900 million in longterm debt maturing in the next twelve months dte energy has 600 million of unsecured debt maturing in june 2011 which is expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated funds and short term debt substantially all of the remaining debt maturities relate to securitization and other detroit edison issues the repayment of the principal amount of the securitization debt is 

funded through a surcharge payable by detroit edison’s electric customers the repayment of the other detroit edison debt is expected to be refinanced with longterm debt 

 

in august 2010 dte energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries detroit edison and michcon entered into amended and restated twoyear 1 billion unsecured revolving credit agreements and new threeyear 800 million unsecured revolving credit agreements with a syndicate of 23 banks that may be used for general corporate borrowings but are intended to provide liquidity support for each of the companies’ commercial paper programs no one bank provides more than 825 of the commitment in any facility borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing shortterm interest rates dte energy has approximately 17 billion of available liquidity at december 31 2010 

 

in march 2010 the ppaca and the hcera were enacted into law collectively the “act” the act is a comprehensive health care reform bill a provision of the ppaca repeals the current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug coverage expense that is offset by the medicare part d subsidy effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 we have initiated changes in benefit design and delivery and are continuing to evaluate alternatives to minimize the impact of the legislation we contributed 200 million to our pension plans during the year ended december 31 2010 including a dte energy stock contribution of 100 million in march 2010 we contributed 160 million to our postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans during the year ended december 31 2010 including a transfer of 25 million from the michcon grantor trust in january 2011 we contributed 200 million to our pension plans also we contributed 81 million to our postretirement medical and life insurance plans in january 2011 and we expect to contribute up to an additional 90 million throughout the remainder of 2011 

 

in july 2010 a federal financial reform act was signed into law the legislation reshapes financial regulation and is intended to address specific issues that contributed to the financial crisis most major areas of the legislation will be dependent upon regulatory interpretation rulemaking and implementation we do not expect any material effect on our operations and financial position 

 

the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 provided for a special allowance for bonus depreciation in 2011 and 2012 bonus depreciation is accelerated depreciation on certain types of business equipment that allows a tax deduction of either 50 or 100 of the cost of qualifying property in the year the asset is placed in service dte energy expects to generate approximately 100 million to 200 million of cash in 20112012 from bonus depreciation deductions a significant portion of which is expected to result from detroit edison property plant and equipment expenditures during the qualifying period the cash benefit is an acceleration of tax deductions that the company would otherwise have received over 20 years 

 

we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows 

 

see notes 12 16 18 and 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

credit ratings 

 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the company’s credit ratings affect our cost of capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

 

as part of the normal course of business detroit edison michcon and various nonutility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade certain of these contracts for detroit edison and michcon contain similar provisions in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade our nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte 

energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

 

in january 2010 standard  poor’s rating group standard  poor’s revised the outlook on dte energy and its subsidiaries to stable from negative and raised the shortterm corporate credit and commercial paper ratings for dte energy detroit edison and michcon to ‘a2’ from ‘a3’ the revision was primarily due to the diminished possibility of a downgrade in light of the company’s decreasing regulatory risk we have experienced an improvement in our ability to issue commercial paper since the restoration of our shortterm ratings shortterm borrowings principally in the form of commercial paper provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities potential instability in the credit markets and any lowering of ratings may impact future access to the commercial paper markets which may require us to draw on our backup facilities in june 2010 standard  poor’s revised the outlook on dte energy and its subsidiaries to positive from stable the outlook revision reflected the company’s decreasing regulatory risk in december 2010 standard and poor’s upgraded the corporate credit rating of dte energy and its utility subsidiaries to ‘bbb’ from ‘bbb’ to reflect the company’s decreasing regulatory risk and improved financial measures at the same time standard and poor’s raised the rating on detroit edison’s senior secured debt to ‘a’ from ‘a’ and raised the rating on michcon’s senior secured debt to ‘a’ from ‘bbb’ in january 2011 fitch ratings revised the rating outlook for detroit edison to positive from stable due to improvement in its credit protection measures as a result of supportive regulatory policies in michigan 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

regulation 

 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses detroit edison and michcon are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

 

in march 2010 the ppaca and the hcera were enacted into law collectively the “act” a provision of the ppaca repeals the current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug coverage expense that is offset by the medicare part d subsidy effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 this change in tax law required a remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the other postretirement benefit obligation opeb and the deferred tax liability related to the opeb regulatory asset income tax accounting rules require the impact of a change in tax law be recognized in continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the tax law change is enacted however regulated businesses may defer changes in tax law if allowed by regulators the mpsc’s historical practice has been to recognize both the expense and working capital impacts for opeb costs in addition the current and deferred tax effects related to opeb costs have been recognized consistently the effects of the subsidy have been reflected through lower tax expense included in rates we believe we have reasonable assurance that the impacts related to the enactment of the act are recoverable through rates in future periods therefore the amounts related to detroit edison of 18 million and michcon of 4 million have been deferred as regulatory assets 

 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

derivatives and hedging activities 

 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by detroit edison and michcon meet the criteria specified for this exception 

 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques credit risk of the company and our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which was immaterial at december 31 2010 and 2009 management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable marketbased inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 

 

the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our forward contracts see sensitivity analysis in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein see notes 4 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and management’s assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances as a result of the reduction in past due receivables in 2010 our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased significantly from the 2009 balance we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates as part of the 2005 gas rate order for michcon the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses the mpsc provided for a similar tracking mechanism for detroit edison in its rate order received january 2010 detroit edison filed for the suspension of the tracking mechanism effective with the order in its pending rate case 

 

asset impairments 

 

goodwill 

 

certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations we perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in performing step 1 of the impairment test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

 

for step 1 of the test we estimate the reporting unit’s fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require 

broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance we also employ marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

 

we performed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2010 and determined that except for the coal services reporting unit the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed the 4 million of goodwill attributable to the coal services reporting unit was written off in the fourth quarter of 2010 in connection with the sale of rail services assets we also compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stock’s market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows 

 

as of october 1 2010 valuation date 

 

 

 

 

  

the gas utility reporting unit passed step 1 of the impairment test by a 7 margin a substantive decrease in market multiples negative regulatory actions or other disruptions in cash flows for the gas utility reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the foreseeable future for example at the current discount rate and holding all other variables constant a 05x decrease in the terminal multiple would lower the fair value by approximately 130 million at the lower fair value the gas utility reporting unit would likely fail step 1 of the test potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill following completion of the step 2 analysis 

 

we perform an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

longlived assets 

 

we evaluate the carrying value of our longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require us to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact our earnings see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

pension and postretirement costs 

 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the company the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required we consider historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

 

we had pension costs for pension plans of 112 million in 2010 58 million in 2009 and 24 million in 2008 postretirement benefits costs for all plans were 164 million in 2010 205 million in 2009 and 142 million in 2008 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2010 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 875 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumptions we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets our 2011 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47 in equity markets 25 in fixed income markets and 28 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we are lowering our longterm rate of return assumption for our pension plans to 850 for 2011 our longterm rate of return assumption for our postretirement health and life plans will remain at 875 for 2011 we believe these two rates are reasonable assumptions for the longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2011 given our investment strategy we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

 

we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for our pension plans we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2010 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2010 we had 242 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for our postretirement benefit plans we use fair value when 

determining the mrv of postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased to 55 at december 31 2010 from 59 at december 31 2009 we estimate that our 2011 total pension costs will approximate 167 million compared to 112 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower discount rate partially offset by better than expected asset returns in 2010 and 2011 contributions our 2011 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 137 million compared to 164 million in 2010 primarily due to changing our strategy for providing post65 prescription drug benefits to retirees better than expected asset returns in 2010 and favorable retiree medical utilization these positive impacts were partially offset by a lower discount rate and updated assumed longterm retiree medical inflation our health care trend rate assumes 7 for 2011 through 2015 65 in 2016 6 in 2017 55 in 2018 and 5 in 2019 and beyond future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design the pension cost tracking mechanism that provided for recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below amounts reflected in detroit edison’s base rates at the request of detroit edison was not reauthorized by the mpsc in its rate order effective january 1 2009 the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of michcon’s negative pension expense michcon records a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2010 pension costs by approximately 30 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2010 pension costs by approximately 10 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2010 by approximately 25 million 

 

the value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets was 39 billion at december 31 2010 and 34 billion at december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 our pension plans were underfunded by 872 million and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 13 billion the 2010 and 2009 funding levels were generally similar due to positive investment performance returns and plan sponsor contributions in 2010 and 2009 largely offset by the decreased discount rates 

 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets we made contributions to our pension plans of 200 million in each of 2010 and 2009 also we contributed 200 million to our pension plans in january 2011 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making contributions to our pension plans of up to 12 billion over the next five years we made postretirement benefit plan contributions of 160 million and 205 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in detroit edison’s and michcon’s base rates as a result we contributed 81 million to our postretirement plans in january 2011 and expect to make up to an additional 90 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2011 and subject to mpsc funding requirements up to 850 million over the next five years the planned contributions will be made in cash dte energy common stock or a combination of cash and stock 

 

see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

legal reserves 

 

we are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us 

insured and uninsured risks 

 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure the maximum selfinsured retention for various risks is as follows property damage 10 million general liability 7 million workers’ compensation 9 million and auto liability7 million we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported ibnr liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate as of december 31 2010 this ibnr liability was approximately 39 million 

 

accounting for tax obligations 

 

we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold we also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that we believe will be realized in future periods we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 are appropriately accounted the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets see notes 4 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

as a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative gas storage transportation and power contracts consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in dte energy’s reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

 

the company manages its marktomarket mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the company has established a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market price risk 

 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

 

the electric and gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations however the company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the form of pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the gas utility gas utility manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the company is exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

 

our gas storage and pipelines business segment has limited exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and manages its exposure through the sale of longterm storage and transportation contracts 

 

our unconventional gas production business segment has exposure to natural gas and crude oil price fluctuations these commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations to manage this exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts 

our power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity natural gas coal and coalbased product price risk and other risks associated with the weakened us economy to the extent that commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of longterm contracts we manage this exposure using forward energy capacity and futures contracts 

 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas crude oil heating oil and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

 

credit risk 

 

bankruptcies 

 

the company purchases and sells electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail financial and other industries certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss the company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

 

other 

 

the company has tracking mechanisms to mitigate a significant amount of losses related to uncollectible accounts receivable at detroit edison and michcon these mechanisms are subject to the jurisdiction of the mpsc and are periodically reviewed see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

 

trading activities 

 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

 57 

  

interest rate risk 

 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2010 we had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately two percent excluding securitized debt 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we have entered into a series of exchange forward contracts through january 2013 additionally we may enter into fair value foreign currency exchange hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans 

 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt obligations and foreign currency exchange forward contracts the commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange risk listed below principally relate to our energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2010 and 2009 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values

corporate structure 

 

based on the following structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance see note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for financial information by segment for the last three years 

 

electric utility 

 

  

gas utility 

 

 6 

  

nonutility operations 

 

  

corporate  other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

 

 

refer to our management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report for an indepth analysis of each segment’s financial results a description of each business unit follows 

 

electric utility 

 

description 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison our generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdeq electricity is generated from our several fossil plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant and a nuclear plant and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to three major classes of customers residential commercial and industrial principally throughout southeastern michigan 

revenue by service 

 

 

 

 

  

weather economic factors competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on detroit edison 

 

fuel supply and purchased power 

 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have nine longterm and nine shortterm contracts for a total purchase of approximately 28 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2010 through 2012 we also have nine longterm and two shortterm contracts for the purchase of approximately 9 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2010 through 2012 all of these contracts have fixed prices we have approximately 87 of our 2010 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities 

 

detroit edison participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles 

 

properties 

 

detroit edison owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2009 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

detroit edison owns and operates 677 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33347000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 423600 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 21883000 kva 

 

circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2009 

 

 

there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between detroit edison and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission and connect to neighboring energy companies 

 

regulation 

 

detroit edison’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edison’s nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

 

see notes 4 9 12 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

energy assistance programs 

 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to detroit edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses detroit edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

 

strategy and competition 

 

we strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast michigan we can accomplish this goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable lowcost supplier of electricity to ensure generation reliability we continue to invest in our generating plants which will improve both plant availability and operating efficiencies we also are making capital investments in areas that have a positive impact on reliability and environmental compliance with the goal of high customer satisfaction 

 

our distribution operations focus on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service we seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report we expect to minimize the impacts of declines in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which will partially decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes 

 

the electric customer choice program in michigan allows all of our electric customers to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers of generation services subject to limits customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 3 of retail sales in 2009 and 2008 and 4 of such sales in 2007 customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose mpscauthorized full service rates exceed their cost of service mpsc rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 cap on the total potential customer choice related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric customer choice on our financial performance we expect that in 2010 customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10 of retail sales when market conditions are favorable we sell power into the wholesale market in order to lower costs to fullservice customers 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

 

gas utility 

 

description 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

 

revenue by service 

 

 

 

  

our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter 

 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas utility segment 

 

natural gas supply 

 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 26 bcf with approximately 67 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2009 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to nymex and published price indices to approximate current market prices 

 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions our primary longterm transportation supply contracts are as follows 

 

 

 

properties 

 

we own distribution transmission and storage properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1177000 service lines and approximately 1312000 active meters we own approximately 2100 miles of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

 

we own properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 132 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties most of our distribution and transmission property is located on property owned by others and used by us through easements permits or licenses substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

 

we own 666 miles of transportation and gathering nonutility pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of michigan we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capitallease arrangement see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

regulation 

 

michcon’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters michcon’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments michcon operates natural gas transportation and storage facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate transportation and storage services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff michcon also provides interstate transportation and storage services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

 

see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

energy assistance program 

 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses michcon’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas in michigan as a result of more efficient furnaces and appliances and customer conservation due to high natural gas prices and economic conditions we expect future sales volumes to decline we expect to minimize the impacts of declines in usage through regulatory mechanisms we have requested in our current rate case which will partially decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

 

our extensive transmission pipeline system has enabled us to market 400 to 500 bcf annually for intermediate transportation services and storage services for michigan gas producers marketers distribution companies and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

 

michcon’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to michcon’s customers as well as sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three years prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and natural gas pricing 

 

gas storage and pipelines 

 

description 

 

gas storage and pipelines owns partnership interests in two interstate transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage fields the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by longterm fixedprice revenue contracts we have a partnership interest in vector pipeline vector an interstate transmission pipeline which connects michigan to chicago and ontario we also hold partnership interests in millennium pipeline company which indirectly connects southern new york state to upper midwestcanadian supply while providing transportation service into the new york city markets we have storage assets in michigan capable of storing up to 90 bcf in natural gas storage fields located in southeast michigan the washington 10 and 28 storage facilities are high deliverability storage fields having bidirectional interconnections with vector pipeline and michcon providing our customers access to the chicago michigan other midwest and ontario markets 

 

our customers include various utilities pipelines and producers and marketers 

properties 

 

the gas storage and pipelines business holds the following property 

 

 

 

the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations pursuant to an operating agreement michcon provides physical operations maintenance and technical support for the washington 28 and washington 10 storage facilities 

 

regulation 

 

the gas storage and pipelines business operates natural gas storage facilities in michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the mpsc and provides intrastate storage and related services pursuant to an mpscapproved tariff we also provide interstate services in accordance with an operating statement on file with the ferc vector and millennium pipelines provide interstate transportation services in accordance with their fercapproved tariffs 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan by expanding existing assets and developing new assets that are typically supported with longterm customer commitments the gas storage and pipelines business focuses on asset development opportunities in the midwesttonortheast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand we expect much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the us to occur within the midatlantic and new england regions we forecast these regions will require incremental pipeline and gas storage infrastructure necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet growing demand vector is an interstate pipeline that is filling a large portion of that need and is complemented by our michigan storage facilities in 2009 we completed the shelby 2 storage field at our washington 10 storage complex which increased the capacity by 3 bcf also in 2009 vector pipeline completed its athens michigan compressor station expansion which increased its longhaul capacity by approximately 100 mmcfd to 13 bcfd due to the proximity of the millennium pipeline to the marcellus shale in southern new yorknorthern pennsylvania we anticipate that the millennium pipeline may have opportunities to expand in the future 

 

unconventional gas production 

 

description 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production primarily within the barnett shale in north texas 

 

in 2009 we added proved reserves of 67 bcfe resulting in yearend total proved reserves of 234 bcfe the barnett shale wells yielded 5 bcfe of production in 2009 barnett shale leasehold acres increased to 69272 gross acres 63367 net of interest of others excluding impairments due to economic conditions and 

low natural gas prices during the year we chose to do minimal lease acquisitions and reduce the number of new wells we drilled a total of 11 wells in the barnett shale acreage in 2009 

 

our barnett shale gas production requires processing to extract natural gas liquids therefore our wells are dedicated to various gathering and processing companies in the fort worth basin the revenues received for all products are based on prevailing market prices 

 

properties and other 

 

the following information pertains to our interests in the barnett shale as of december 31 

 

 

 

 

  

strategy and competition 

 

we manage and operate our properties to maximize returns on investment and increase earnings we continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and seek opportunities for acquisitions or divestitures of select properties within our asset base when conditions are appropriate competitive pressures in the barnett shale have decreased due to lower commodity prices resulting in reduced investment by industry participants this downward pressure has created opportunities for us to reduce operating expenses and grow at lower cost than in prior periods 

from time to time we use financial derivative contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas on our forecasted natural gas sales the following is a summary of the financial contracts in place at december 31 2009 related to barnett shale production 

 

 

 

in 2010 we expect to drill approximately 10 to 15 wells in the barnett shale investment for the area is expected to be approximately 25 million during 2010 

 

power and industrial projects 

 

description 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation and marketing and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects this business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries 

 

products and services include pulverized coal and petroleum coke supply metallurgical coke supply power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment compressed air supply and reduced emission fuel we own and operate one gasfired peaking electric generating plant two biomassfired electric generating plants and own one coalfired power plant two additional biomassfired electric generating plants are currently under development pending certain regulatory approvals with expected inservice dates of august 2010 and march 2013 production tax credits related to two of the coke battery facilities expired on december 31 2009 

 

we also provide coal transportation services including fuel transportation storage blending and rail equipment management services our external customers include electric utilities merchant power producers integrated steel mills and large industrial companies with significant energy requirements additionally we participate in coal marketing and the purchase and sale of emissions credits we own and operate a coal transloading terminal in south chicago illinois 

 

we develop own and operate landfill gas recovery systems throughout the united states landfill gas a byproduct of solid waste decomposition is composed of approximately equal portions of methane and carbon dioxide we develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy in addition to providing environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions this business segment performs coal mine methane extraction in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines 

 

we deliver reduced emission fuel to utilities with coalfired electric generation power plants we own and operate five facilities that process raw coal into reduced emission fuel resulting in significant reductions in nitrogen oxide no sulfur dioxide so 2  and mercury hg emissions production tax credits are expected to be generated by these facilities beginning in 2010 and continuing for ten years upon achieving certain criteria including entering into transactions with unrelated equity partners or thirdparty customers for the reduced emission fuel we expect to reduce our ownership interests in these facilities in 2010 we are investors in steel industry fuel entities which sell steel industry fuel to unrelated parties at three coke battery sites steel industry fuels facilities recycle tar decanter sludge a byproduct of the coking process tax credits were generated in 2009 and we expect to generate additional credits in 2010 the ability to generate tax credits from the steel industry fuel process expires at the end of 2010

strategy and competition 

 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel renewable power onsite energy coal transportation marketing storage and blending landfill gas recovery and reduced emission fuel businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties there are limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide similar products and services 

 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our interrelated businesses as we expand as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 

  

after experiencing a weakened us economy including constricted capital and credit markets we expect a return to normal demand for our steelrelated products in 2010 improving the financial performance of our coke battery and pulverized coal operations in addition our two primary automotive customers general motors and chrysler have emerged from bankruptcy and we continue providing onsite products and services we will continue to monitor the steel and automotive industries closely during 2010 

 

our coal transportation and marketing business will continue to leverage its existing business in 2010 trends such as carbon and greenhouse gas legislation railroad and mining consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing new mines could have an impact on how we compete in the future in 2011 our existing longterm rail transportation contract which is at rates significantly below the current market will expire and we anticipate a decrease in transportationrelated revenue of approximately 120 million as a result we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers we will seek to build our capacity to transport store and blend greater amounts of coal and expect to continue to grow our business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments 

 

energy trading 

 

description 

 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

 

significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipelines and storage and power transmission and generation capacity positions most financial instruments are deemed derivatives however gas inventory power transmission pipelines and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets this results in gains and losses that are 

recognized in different accounting periods we may incur marktomarket gains or losses in one period that could reverse in subsequent periods 

 

regulation 

 

energy trading has marketbased rate authority from the ferc to sell power and authority from ferc to sell natural gas at market prices energy trading is subject to ferc reporting requirements and market behavior rules energy trading also complies with position limits and reporting requirements related to financial trading set by the commodity futures trading commission 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric and gas marketers financial institutions traders utilities and other energy providers the trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating the company believes it has ample available capital capacity to support energy trading activities we monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that our commitments do not exceed capacity a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk

synthetic fuel 

 

description 

 

due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007 the synthetic fuel business ceased operations and was classified as a discontinued operation as of december 31 2007 synfuel plants chemically changed coal and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code production tax credits were provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and were available through december 31 2007 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related 

to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations 

 

 

 

air — detroit edison is subject to the epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions further additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

 

water — in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies detroit edison may be required to perform some mitigation activities including the possible installation of additional control technologies to reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures however a january 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation resulting in a delay in complying with the regulation in 2008 the us supreme court agreed to review the remanded costbenefit analysis provision of the rule and in april 2009 upheld epa’s use of this provision in determining best available technology for reducing environmental impacts concurrently the epa continues to develop a revised rule a draft of which is expected to be published by summer 2010 the epa has also proposed an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines it is not possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing requirements 

 

manufactured gas plant mgp and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas for heating and other uses have been designated as mgp sites gas utility owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites detroit edison owns or previously owned three former mgp sites in addition to the mgp sites we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 

 

landfill — detroit edison owns and operates a permitted engineered ash storage facility at the monroe power plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant detroit edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and reconstruction 

 

the epa has expressed its intentions to develop new federal regulations for coal ash under the authority of the resources conservation and recovery act rcra a proposed regulation is expected in the first quarter of 2010 among the options epa is currently considering is a ruling that may designate coal ash as a “hazardous waste” as defined by rcra however agencies and legislatures have urged epa to regulate coal ash as a nonhazardous waste if epa were to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste the agency could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes 

some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers 

 

global climate change — climate regulation andor legislation is being proposed and discussed within the us congress and the epa on june 26 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act acesa the acesa includes a cap and trade program that would start in 2012 and provides for costs to emit greenhouse gases despite action by the senate environmental and public works committee to pass a similar but more stringent bill in october 2009 full senate action on a climate bill is not expected before the spring of 2010 meanwhile the epa is beginning to implement regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emission of greenhouse gases pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures and the purchase of emission allowances from market sources we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable andor nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments it is not possible to quantify these impacts on dte energy or its customers at this time 

 

nonutility — our nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants our nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 

 

see notes 12 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report 

 

employees 

 

we had 10244 employees as of december 31 2009 of which 5186 were represented by unions the majority of our union employees are under contracts that expire in june and october 2010 and august 2012

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energy’s utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our utility and nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve our utilities and certain nonutility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel industries which have undergone considerable financial distress exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions should national or regional economic conditions further decline reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services we supply collections of accounts receivable and potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas will result in decreased earnings and cash flow 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us regional and national economic condition s  increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in credit rating may 

require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which could impact our liquidity 

 

our ability to access capital markets is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses in the past turmoil in credit markets has constrained and may again in the future constrain our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets we have substantial amounts of credit facilities that expire in 2010 we intend to seek to renew the facilities on or before the expiration dates however we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts which could result in a decrease in amounts available andor an increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our financial performance 

 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations our costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from detroit edison or michcon customers the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements we routinely have speculative trading positions in the market within strict policy guidelines we set resulting from the management of our business portfolio to the extent speculative trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position we manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures during periods of extreme volatility these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we do business adverse economic conditions affecting or financial difficulties of counterparties with whom we do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their contractual obligations or cause them to delay such payments or obligations we depend on these counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers’ rates our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers’ rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations the state of michigan will elect a new governor and legislature in 2010 and we cannot predict the outcome of that election we cannot predict whether election results or changes in political conditions will affect the regulations or interpretations affecting our utilities new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses 

 

we may be required to refund amounts we collect under selfimplemented rates michigan law allows our utilities to selfimplement rate changes six months after a rate filing subject to certain limitations however if the final rate case order provides for lower rates than we have selfimplemented we must refund the difference with interest we have selfimplemented rates in the past and have been ordered to make refunds to customers our financial performance may be negatively affected if the mpsc sets lower rates in future rate cases than those we have selfimplemented thereby requiring us to issue refunds we cannot predict what rates an mpsc order will adopt in future rate cases 

 

michigan’s electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the electric customer choice program as originally contemplated in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates in addition such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers mpsc rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a cap on the total potential customer choice related migration however even with the electric customer choicerelated relief received in recent detroit edison rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation in the electric customer choice program there continues to be financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and bundled electric service price increases 

 

weather significantly affects operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process 

 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance 

 

construction and capital improvements to our power facilities subject us to risk we are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power 

generation and distribution facilities many factors that could cause delay or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control including the cost of materials and labor subcontractor performance timing and issuance of necessary permits construction disputes and weather conditions failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities 

 

the supply andor price of energy commodities andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and on the profitability of our nonutility business our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers we have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of natural gas also impacts the market for our nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

 

the supply andor price other industrial raw and finished inputs andor related services may impact our financial results we are dependent on supplies of certain commodities such as copper and limestone among others and industrial materials and services in order to maintain daytoday operations and maintenance of our facilities price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our nonutility businesses 

 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

 

our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change while we cannot provide absolute assurance that our estimates of our barnett gas reserves are accurate great care is exercised in utilizing historical information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of future production and cash flow we estimate proved gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves including factors beyond our control reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves or of cash flows attributable to such reserves is a function of the available data assumptions regarding expenditures for future development and exploration activities and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment additionally reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history development and exploration activities and prices of gas actual future production revenue taxes development expenditures operating expenses quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information we used 

 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources we have generated production tax credits from synfuel coke production landfill gas recovery biomass fired electric generation reduced emission fuel steel industry fuel and gas production operations we have received favorable private letter rulings on all of the synfuel facilities all production tax credits taken after 2006 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows we have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities 

 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and 

securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities based on these regulations additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented the operations of our fossilfuel generation assets and our unconventional gas production assets may be significantly impacted since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

 

renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business we are subject to michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy under the current michigan legislation we will be required in the future to provide a specified percentage of our power from michigan renewable energy sources we are developing a strategy for complying with the existing state legislation but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation we are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and identifying third party projects in which we can invest we cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with these future projects 

 

we are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage we do not know how these programs will impact our business and future operating results 

 

threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our business we may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure despite our implementation of security measures all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes if our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

in addition our generation plants gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products we have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict 

 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations 

 

failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers 

shareholders and employees our customers shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information and the united states regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or dte energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation 

 

benefits of continuous improvement initiatives could be less than we expect we have a continuous improvement program that is expected to result in significant cost savings actual results achieved through this program could be less than our expectations 

 

a work interruption may adversely affect us unions represent approximately 5000 of our employees a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business contracts with several of our unions including our contract with our largest union representing about 3800 of our employees expire on different dates throughout 2010 in addition our contracts with unions representing two small groups of employees expired on december 31 2009 and another union is currently negotiating its first contract we cannot predict the outcome of any of these contract negotiations some of which have not yet commenced we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

 

failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in certain legal regulatory administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings include certain contract disputes environmental reviews and investigations audits inquiries from various regulators and pending judicial matters we cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings we regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss the resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in the period they are resolved 

 

in february 2008 dte energy was named as one of approximately 24 defendant oil power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in a united states district court dte energy was served with process in march 2008 the plaintiffs the native village of kivalina and city of kivalina which are home to approximately 400 people in alaska claim that the defendants’ business activities have contributed to global warming and as a result higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall and winter as a result the plaintiffs are seeking damages of up to 400 million for relocation costs associated with moving the village to a safer location as well as unspecified attorney’s fees and expenses on october 15 2009 the us district court granted defendants’ motions dismissing all of plaintiffs’ federal claims in the case on two independent grounds 1 the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claims because of the political question doctrine and 2 plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims the court also dismissed plaintiffs’ state law claims because the court lacked supplemental jurisdiction over them after it dismissed the federal claims the dismissal of the state law claims was without prejudice the plaintiffs have appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 

 

in july 2009 dte energy received a notice of violationfinding of violation novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five detroit edison power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and title v operating permit requirements under the clean air act we believe that the plants identified by the epa have complied with applicable regulations depending upon the outcome of our discussions with the epa regarding the novfov the epa 

could bring legal action against detroit edison we could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines we cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2009 operating revenues in excess of 8 billion and over 24 billion in assets we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout southeastern michigan we operate four energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

 

 

the decrease in 2009 net income attributable to dte energy from 2008 was primarily due to the 80 million aftertax gain recorded in the unconventional gas production segment on the 2008 sale of a portion of barnett shale properties partially offset by higher earnings in the electric utility and energy trading segments the decrease in net income attributable to dte energy in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to 370 million in net income resulting from the 580 million aftertax gain on the 2007 sale of the antrim shale gas exploration and production business partially offset by 210 million aftertax losses recognized on related hedges including recognition of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income during 2007 

 

the items discussed below influenced our current financial performance andor may affect future results 

 

  

reference in this report to “we” “us” “our” “company” or “dte” are to dte energy and its subsidiaries collectively 

 

utility operations 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison which is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 21 million customers in southeastern michigan 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 12 million customers throughout michigan citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

impact of national and regional economic conditions 

 

revenues from our utility operations follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in reduced demand for electricity and natural gas in our service territory with corresponding declines in our revenues 

 

 

 

during 2009 detroit edison experienced decreases in sales predominantly in the industrial class and to a lesser extent in the residential and commercial classes partially offset by higher interconnection sales michcon’s revenues were lower due primarily to lower natural gas costs and customer conservation we expect to minimize the impacts of declines in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which will decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes we expect to be impacted by the challenges in the domestic automotive and steel industries and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies direct and indirect effects of further automotive and other industrial plant closures could have a significant impact on the results of detroit edison as discussed further below deteriorating economic conditions impact our ability to collect amounts due from our electric and gas customers and drive increased thefts of electricity and natural gas in the face of these economic conditions we are actively managing our cash capital expenditures cost structure and liquidity to maintain our financial strength 

 

collectibility of accounts receivable on utility operations 

 

although lower than peak levels in 2008 both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables primarily attributable to economic conditions our service territories continue to experience high levels of unemployment underemployment and low income households home foreclosures and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers despite the current economic conditions total arrears were reduced during 2009 in our electric and gas utilities we have taken actions to manage the level of past due receivables including increasing customer disconnections contracting with collection agencies and working with michigan officials and others to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers 

 

 

 

the mpsc has provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism for michcon since 2005 the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism enables michcon to recover or refund 90 percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each year and 37 million after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 

 

the january 2010 mpsc electric rate order provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism for detroit edison the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism enables detroit edison to recover or refund 80 percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each year and 66 million after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 

 

the bankruptcies of general motors corporation gm and chrysler llc chrysler did not have a significant impact to our uncollectible expense in 2009 

impact of regulatory decisions on utility operations 

 

on january 11 2010 the mpsc issued an order in detroit edison’s january 26 2009 rate case filing the mpsc approved an annual revenue increase of 217 million or a 48 increase in detroit edison’s annual revenue requirement for 2010 included in the approved increase in revenues was a return on equity of 11 on an expected 49 equity and 51 debt permanent capital structure since the final rate relief ordered was less than the company’s selfimplemented rate increase of 280 million effective on july 26 2009 the mpsc ordered refunds for the period the selfimplemented rates were in effect detroit edison has recorded a refund liability of 27 million at december 31 2009 representing the 2009 portion of the estimated refund due customers including interest the mpsc ordered detroit edison to file a refund plan by april 1 2010 

 

other key aspects of the mpsc order include the following 

 

  

michcon filed a general rate case on june 9 2009 based on a 2008 historical test year the filing with the mpsc requested a 193 million or 115 percent average increase in michcon’s annual revenues for a 2010 projected test year the requested 193 million increase in revenues is required to recover the increased costs associated with increased investments in net plant and working capital an increase in the base level of the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism and the cost of natural gas theft primarily due to economic conditions in michigan sales reductions due to customer conservation and the trend of warmer weather on michcon’s market and increasing operating costs largely due to inflation pursuant to the october 2008 michigan legislation and the settlement in michcon’s last base gas sale case michcon selfimplemented 170 million of its requested annual increase on january 1 2010 this increase will remain in place until a final order is issued by the mpsc which is expected in june 2010 subject to refund see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

nonutility operations 

 

we have significant investments in nonutility businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets skills and expertise specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile we expect growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments in the future expansion of these businesses will also result in our ability to further diversify geographically 

 

gas storage and pipelines owns partnership interests in two natural gas storage fields and two interstate pipelines serving the midwest ontario and northeast markets much of the growth in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the midatlantic and new england regions forecasts indicate that these regions will require incremental gas storage and pipeline infrastructure to meet demand growth our vector and 

millennium pipelines are wellpositioned to provide access routes and lowcost expansion options to these markets 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production within the barnett shale in north texas we continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties within our barnett shale holdings when conditions are appropriate due to economic conditions and low natural gas prices during the year we chose to do minimal lease acquisitions and reduce the number of new wells this year however we continue to evaluate leasing opportunities in active development areas in the barnett shale to optimize our existing portfolio 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation and marketing and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects this business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries renewable energy environmental and economic trends are creating growth opportunities the increasing number of states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides the opportunity to market the expertise of the power and industrial projects segment in landfill gas onsite energy management wastewood power generation and other related services 

 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf 

 

discontinued operations 

 

synthetic fuel 

 

the synthetic fuel business was presented as a nonutility segment through the third quarter of 2007 due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007 the synthetic fuel business ceased operations and was classified as a discontinued operation as of december 31 2007 

 

capital investments 

 

we anticipate significant capital investments during the next three years concentrated primarily in detroit edison 

 

 

 

our utility businesses require significant capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of their asset bases including power generation plants distribution systems storage fields and other facilities and fleets in addition detroit edison’s investments excluding investments in new baseload generation capacity if any will be driven by renewable investment and environmental controls expenditures we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment nonutility investments are expected primarily in continued investment in gas storage and pipeline assets and renewable opportunities in the power and industrial projects businesses 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers 

 

air — detroit edison is subject to the epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions further additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants it is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time 

 

in july 2009 dte energy received a notice of violationfinding of violation novfov from the epa alleging among other things that five detroit edison power plants violated new source performance standards prevention of significant deterioration requirements and title v operating permit requirements under the clean air act we believe that the plants identified by the epa have complied with applicable regulations depending upon the outcome of our discussions with the epa regarding the novfov the epa could bring legal action against detroit edison we could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question engage in supplemental environmental programs andor pay fines we cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution 

 

water — in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of studies some of which have already been completed but more are expected to be conducted over the next several years detroit edison may be required to perform some mitigation activities including the possible installation of additional control technologies to reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures however a january 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation resulting in a delay in complying with the regulation in 2008 the us supreme court agreed to review the remanded costbenefit analysis provision of the rule and in april 2009 upheld epa’s use of this provision in determining best available technology for reducing environmental impacts concurrently the epa continues to develop a revised rule a draft of which is expected to be published by summer 2010 the epa has also proposed an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines it is not possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing requirements 

 

manufactured gas plant mgp and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas for heating and other uses have been designated as mgp sites gas utility owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites detroit edison owns or previously owned three former mgp sites in addition to the mgp sites we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations these other sites include an engineered ash storage facility electrical distribution substations gas pipelines and underground and aboveground storage tank locations cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 

 

landfill — detroit edison owns and operates a permitted engineered ash storage facility at the monroe power plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant detroit edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and reconstruction the results of the engineering study show that the estimated cost to perform the embankment repairs are 17 million which we expect to incur over the next four years 

 

the epa has expressed its intentions to develop new federal regulations for coal ash under the authority of the resources conservation and recovery act rcra a proposed regulation is expected in the first 

quarter of 2010 among the options epa is currently considering is a ruling that may designate coal ash as a “hazardous waste” as defined by rcra however agencies and legislatures have urged epa to regulate coal ash as a nonhazardous waste if epa were to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste the agency could apply some or all of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers 

 

global climate change 

 

climate regulation andor legislation is being proposed and discussed within the us congress and the epa on june 26 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act acesa the acesa includes a cap and trade program that would start in 2012 and provides for costs to emit greenhouse gases despite action by the senate environmental and public works committee to pass a similar but more stringent bill in october 2009 full senate action on a climate bill is not expected before the spring of 2010 meanwhile the epa is beginning to implement regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emission of greenhouse gases pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned financing costs related to additional capital expenditures and the purchase of emission allowances from market sources we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable andor nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the development of marketbased trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and nonutility segments it is not possible to quantify these impacts on dte energy or its customers at this time 

 

see notes 12 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and items 1 and 2 business and properties 

 

outlook 

 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth 

 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 

  

we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

results of operations 

 

the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments 

 

 

 

 

  

electric utility 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison 

 

electric utility results are discussed below 

 

 

gross margin increased 127 million during 2009 and decreased 118 million in 2008 the following table displays changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

operation and maintenance expense decreased 45 million in 2009 and decreased 100 million in 2008 the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to 71 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense information technology and other staff expenses 14 million of lower employee benefitrelated expenses lower storm expenses of 12 million 9 million of reduced uncollectible expenses and 6 million of reduced maintenance activities partially offset by higher pension and health care costs of 54 million and 14 million of energy optimization and renewable energy expenses the decrease in 2008 was due primarily to lower information systems implementation costs of 60 million lower employee benefitrelated expenses of 45 million and 29 million from continuous improvement initiatives resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense information technology and other staff expenses partially offset by higher uncollectible expenses of 22 million 

 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 101 million in 2009 due primarily to a higher depreciable base and increased amortization of regulatory assets and decreased 21 million in 2008 due primarily to decreased amortization of regulatory assets 

 

taxes other than income were lower by 27 million due primarily to a 30 million reduction in property tax expense due to refunds received in settlement of appeals of assessments for prior years taxes decreased 45 million in 2008 due to the michigan single business tax sbt expense in 2007 which was replaced with the michigan business tax mbt in 2008 the mbt is accounted for in the income tax provision 

 

outlook  — unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in reduced demand for electricity in our service territory and continued high levels in our uncollectible accounts receivable the magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies the january 2010 mpsc rate order provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism and a revenue decoupling mechanism will assist in mitigating these impacts 

 

to address the challenges of the national and regional economies we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of detroit edison we continue to favorably resolve outstanding regulatory issues many of which were addressed by michigan legislation we expect that our planned significant environmental and renewable expenditures will result in earnings growth looking forward we face additional issues such as higher levels of capital spending volatility in prices for coal and other commodities investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change we expect to continue 

an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

 

gas utility 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

 

gas utility results are discussed below 

 

 

 

gross margin decreased 43 million in 2009 and increased 63 million in 2008 the decrease in 2009 reflects 28 million of lower revenues from the uncollectible tracking mechanism 15 million of additional lost and stolen gas 12 million of continued customer conservation efforts 5 million of lower end user transportation revenue 5 million of realized hedging losses the effects of unfavorable weather of 4 million and reduced late payment revenue of 4 million partially offset by 22 million higher midstream transportation and storage revenues 5 million in energy optimization revenues and 5 million higher appliance service revenues the increase in 2008 reflects 49 million from the uncollectible tracking mechanism 15 million related to the impacts of colder weather 10 million favorable result of lower lost gas recognized and higher valued gas received as compensation for transportation of third party customer gas 7 million of 2007 gcr disallowances and 6 million of appliance repair revenue the 2008 improvement was partially offset by 19 million of lower storage services revenue and 12 million from customer conservation and lower volumes 

 

 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 49 million in 2009 and increased 35 million in 2008 the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to 33 million of reduced uncollectible expenses 15 million of lower employee benefitrelated expenses 14 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense information technology and other staff expenses partially offset by higher health care expenses of 8 million and 4 million of energy optimization expenses the 2008 increase is primarily attributable to 56 million of higher uncollectible expenses partially offset by 14 million from continuous improvement initiatives resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense information technology and other staff expenses and 14 million of reduced pension and health care expenses uncollectible expense was higher in 2008 due to an analysis of our greater than ninety day receivables that indicated a change in the mix of customers in that group and therefore an increased risk of collection the changes in uncollectible expenses are substantially offset by changes in revenues from the uncollectible tracking mechanism included in the gross margin discussion 

 

asset gains losses net decreased 8 million due to a lower gain on the sale of base gas of 15 million and a gain related to the sale of certain gathering and processing assets the 2008 increase of 23 million was due primarily to the sale of base gas 

 

outlook — unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of customers in our service territory customer conservation and continued high levels of theft and uncollectible accounts receivable the magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies the uncollectible tracking mechanism provided by the mpsc assists in mitigating the continued pressure on accounts receivable 

 

to address the challenges of the national and regional economies we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of gas utility we continue to resolve outstanding regulatory issues looking forward we face additional issues such as volatility in gas prices investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs we expect to continue an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity minimize lost and stolen gas remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

 

gas storage and pipelines 

 

our gas storage and pipelines segment consists of our nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses 

 

gas storage and pipelines results are discussed below 

 

 

 

net income attributable to dte energy increased 11 million and 4 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the 2009 increase was driven by higher operating revenues resulting from increased capacity sold and higher rates from renewing storage contracts related to longterm agreements in addition there were 

higher equity earnings from our investments in the vector and millennium pipelines reflecting a first full year of operations for millennium the 2008 increase is due to higher storage revenues related to expansion of capacity and higher other income primarily driven by higher equity earnings in the vector and millennium pipelines partially offset by a higher tax provision due to the mbt in 2008 

 

outlook — our gas storage and pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan in 2009 an additional 3 bcf of storage capacity was placed in service the vector pipeline phase 2 expansion which added approximately 100 mmcfday was placed in service in october 2009 and is supported by customers under longterm contracts millennium pipeline was placed inservice in december 2008 and currently has nearly 85 percent of its capacity sold to customers under longterm contracts we are also a 50 percent owner in the proposed dawn gateway pipeline the dawn gateway project is designed to initially transport 360000 dthd from our michigan storage facilities to the dawn hub in ontario canada and upon successful and timely regulatory approval is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter 2010 

 

unconventional gas production 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production within the barnett shale in northern texas in june 2007 we sold our antrim shale gas exploration and production business in northern michigan for gross proceeds of 1262 billion in january 2008 we sold a portion of our barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately 260 million the properties sold included 75 bcf of proved reserves on approximately 11000 net acres in the core area of the barnett shale we recognized a gain of 128 million 80 million aftertax on the sale in 2008 

 

unconventional gas production results are discussed below 

 

 

 

operating revenues decreased 17 million in 2009 and increased 276 million in 2008 the 2009 decrease is the result of lower commodity prices while production remained relatively flat the 2008 increase was principally due to the impact of losses on 2007 financial contracts that hedged our price risk exposure related to expected antrim gas production and sales through 2013 excluding the impact of the losses on the antrim hedges operating revenues decreased 47 million in 2008 the decreases were principally due to lower natural gas sales volumes as a result of our monetization initiatives partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher gas and oil production on retained wells 

 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 7 million in 2009 due to operational efficiencies and lower costs for goods and services the 2008 decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of a portion of the barnett shale in january 2008 and the antrim sale in june 2007 

 

asset gains and losses net decreased 126 in 2009 and increased 147 million in 2008 the 2009 decrease as compared to 2008 was due to the gain of 128 million 80 million aftertax on the 2008 sale of a portion of our barnett shale properties and 2 million lower impairment in 2009 of expired or expiring leasehold positions that the company does not intend to drill at current commodity prices the increase in 2008 of 147 million was due to the gain on sale of barnett shale core properties partially offset by 8 million 

of impairment losses primarily related to leases on unproved acreage that we did not anticipate developing due to economic conditions 

 

outlook — in the longerterm we plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties within our asset base when conditions are appropriate our strategy for 2010 is to maintain our focus on reducing operating expenses and optimizing production volume during 2010 we expect to invest approximately 25 million to drill 10 to 15 new wells and achieve production of approximately 5 bcfe of natural gas compared with 5 bcfe in 2009 

 

power and industrial projects 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation services and marketing and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects 

 

power and industrial projects results are discussed below 

 

 

 

operating revenues decreased 326 million in 2009 and 257 million in 2008 the 2009 decrease is due primarily to 111 million reduction in certain coal structured transactions 176 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and 84 million of lower coke demand partially offset by a 107 million increase in coal related services the 2008 decrease was primarily attributable to 177 million of reductions in coal transportation and trading volumes and 28 million for the impact of a customer electing to purchase coal directly from the supplier 

 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 306 million in 2009 and 244 million in 2008 the 2009 decrease is due primarily to 111 million decrease in certain coal structured transactions and 64 million of lower coke demand 141 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and operating expenses partially offset by 75 million of higher coal related services the 2008 decrease mostly reflects 174 million of lower coal transportation costs driven by reduced sales combined with a reduction in coal trading results 

 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 6 million in 2009 and decreased 7 million in 2008 in 2007 we announced our plans to sell a 50 interest in a portfolio of select power and industrial projects as a result the assets and liabilities of the projects were classified as held for sale at that time and the company ceased recording depreciation and amortization expense related to these assets during the second quarter of 2008 our work on this planned monetization was discontinued and the assets and liabilities of the projects 

were no longer classified as held for sale depreciation and amortization resumed in june 2008 when the assets were reclassified as held and used 

 

other assets gains losses reserves and impairments net increased 12 million in 2009 and expense decreased 6 million in 2008 this variation in this item is due primarily to a loss recorded in 2008 of approximately 19 million related to the valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation and amortization upon reclassification of certain project assets as held and used partially offset by gains attributable to the sale of one of our coke battery projects where the proceeds were dependent on future production production at this coke battery was operating at lower production volumes in 2009 

 

other income and deductions were lower by 19 million in 2009 due primarily to higher intercompany interest associated with project construction and a reduction in equity earnings in an investment in a coke battery 

 

outlook  — the stabilization in the us economy is having a positive impact on our customers in the steel industry and we expect a corresponding improvement in demand for metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to these customers for 2010 we supply onsite energy services to the domestic automotive manufacturers who have also experienced stabilized demand for autos chrysler and gm have emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection we have been in discussions with both automakers and do not anticipate significant impacts to onsite energy services our onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts we continue to monitor developments in this sector 

 

in 2010 we will continue to capture benefits from production tax credits generated from our steel industry fuel and our reduced emission fuel projects we will also begin to generate production tax credits from our reduced emission fuel projects in 2011 our existing longterm rail transportation contract which is at rates significantly below the current market will expire and we anticipate a decrease in transportationrelated revenue of approximately 120 million as a result we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers we will also continue to look for opportunities to acquire energy projects and biomass fired generating projects for favorable prices 

 

energy trading 

 

energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions energy trading also provides natural gas power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf 

energy trading results are discussed below 

 

 

 

gross margin increased 48 million in 2009 and 35 million in 2008 overall operating revenues and fuel purchased power and gas were impacted by a decrease in gas and power commodity prices in 2009 as compared to 2008 the 48 million increase in gross margin in 2009 was due to increases in realized margins of 69 million offset by decreases in unrealized margins of 21 million the 69 million increase in realized margins was primarily the result of increases in our gas trading strategy and timingrelated increases in our gas storage and transportation optimization strategies the 21 million decrease in unrealized margins consisted of unfavorable results of 58 million from our gas trading and gas marketing and origination strategies partially offset by increases of 29 million in our power trading and timingrelated improvements of 8 million in our oil strategies 

 

the 2008 increase was due to higher unrealized margin of 66 million offset by a decrease in realized margin of 31 million the increase in unrealized margins includes gains in our gas strategies and the absence of 30 million in marktomarket losses in june 2007 reflecting revisions of valuation estimates for natural gas contracts the decrease in realized margin was due to unfavorable results of 28 million primarily from our power marketing and transmission optimization strategies 34 million of unfavorability in our gas storage and full requirements strategies due to falling prices in 2008 offset by 31 million of improvement in our gas trading strategy 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 3 million and 10 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the 2009 increase was due to higher payroll and incentive costs and commissions partially offset by lower contractor expense and allocated corporate costs the 2008 increase is due to higher payroll and incentive costs and allocated corporate costs 

 

income tax provision increased 6 million in 2009 due to an increase in income taxes resulting from higher pretax income partially offset by 10 million of favorable taxrelated adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits 

 

outlook — significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments physical commodity contracts and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generation capacity positions energy trading also provides power and ancillary services and natural gas to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transport contracts on the customers’ behalf most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives whereas proprietary gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying nonderivative contracts and assets with futures forwards swaps and options this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

factors impacting income the 2009 net loss of 70 million decreased from the net loss of 94 million in 2008 due to 34 million favorable taxrelated adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits 10 million lower intercompany interest expense and 9 million lower costs related to natural gas forward contracts associated with the 2007 sale of the antrim shale properties these favorable variances were partially offset by a 10 million donation of cash and availableforsale securities to the dte energy foundation 10 million resulting from a realignment of employee benefit expense from michcon 7 million increase in financing fees 1 million increased impairment of investments and a 1 million decrease in interest income the 2008 net loss of 94 million was lower than the 2007 net income of 502 million due to the 2007 gain on the sale of the antrim shale gas exploration and production business for approximately 900 million 580 million aftertax 

 

discontinued operations 

 

synthetic fuel 

 

due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits in 2007 the synthetic fuel business ceased operations and was classified as a discontinued operation as of december 31 2007

cumulative effect of accounting changes 

 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted asc 820 sfas no 157 fair value measurements  the cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of asc 820 represented a 4 million increase to the january 1 2008 balance of retained earnings see also the “fair value” section 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted asc 740 fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  the cumulative effect of the adoption of asc 740 represented a 5 million reduction to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings 

 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

cash requirements 

 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements in 2010 we expect that cash from operations will be lower due to higher tax payments and working capital requirements we anticipate base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2010 of up to 14 billion the capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to renewable and energy optimization related expenditures we incurred environmental expenditures of approximately 116 million in 2009 and we expect over 22 billion of future capital expenditures through 2019 to satisfy both existing and proposed new requirements we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment capital spending for growth of existing or new nonutility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

 

debt maturing in 2010 totals approximately 661 million 

 

 

 

cash from operating activities 

 

a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs 

 

cash from operations totaling 18 billion in 2009 increased 260 million from the comparable 2008 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects lower working capital requirements and higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred taxes and gains on sales of assets 

 

cash from operations totaling 16 billion in 2008 increased 434 million from the comparable 2007 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred taxes and gains on sales of assets and cash payments received related to our synfuel program hedges 

cash from investing activities 

 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements capital spending within our nonutility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we initially invest based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

 

net cash used for investing activities was approximately 11 billion in 2009 compared with net cash used for investing activities of 15 billion in 2008 the change was primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures by our utility and nonutility businesses and the completion of refund payments to our synfuel partners in 2008 

 

net cash used for investing activities increased 19 billion in 2008 due primarily to the sale of our antrim shale gas exploration and production business in 2007 which offset most of the capital expenditures during that period and the completion of synfuel partner refunds in 2008 

 

cash from financing activities 

 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations 

 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 to 52 to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our longterm debt and strengthening our balance sheet the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 789 million in 2009 compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately 84 million for the same period in 2008 the change was primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

 

net cash used for financing activities decreased 14 billion in 2008 primarily related to the repurchase of common stock in 2007 and increased issuances of longterm debt 

 

outlook 

 

we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and the nonutility businesses we expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined our nonutility growth is expected from additional investments in energy projects as economic conditions improve 

 

we have been impacted by unfavorable national and regional economic trends that have reduced demand for electricity in our service territory we may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our pscr and gcr costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects 

in april 2009 we completed an early renewal of 975 million of our syndicated revolving credit facilities before their scheduled expiration in october 2009 the new 1 billion twoyear facility will expire in 2011 and has similar covenants to the prior facility a new twoyear 50 million credit facility was completed in may 2009 and a new oneyear 70 million credit facility was completed in june 2009 we have a 925 million fiveyear facility that expires in october 2010 we expect to pursue the renewal of that facility before its expiration given current conditions in the credit markets we anticipate that the new facility will be similar to our april 2009 facility with respect to such items as bank participation allocation levels and covenants we are evaluating the need to renew our 70 million bilateral credit facility expiring in june 2010 which is used to support the issuance of letters of credit see note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

as a result of losses experienced in the 2008 financial markets our benefit plan assets experienced negative returns which have resulted in higher benefit costs and contributions in 2009 and potentially in future years relative to the recent past during 2009 our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans assets experienced positive returns of approximately 20 and 22 respectively during 2010 we expect to contribute up to 200 million to our pension plans and up to 130 million to our postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans 

 

while the impact of continued market volatility and turmoil in the credit markets cannot be predicted we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows

credit ratings 

 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

 

as part of the normal course of business detroit edison michcon and various nonutility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the credit rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade certain of these contracts for detroit edison and michcon contain similar provisions in the event that the credit rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade our nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets the impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 

 

in may 2009 standard  poor’s rating group standard  poor’s revised the outlook on dte energy and its subsidiaries to negative from stable and lowered the shortterm corporate credit and commercial paper ratings for dte energy detroit edison and michcon to a3 from a2 the revision was primarily due to concerns over michigan’s economic climate moody’s investors service moody’s affirmed our existing shortterm ratings of p2 in august 2009 moody’s upgraded the majority of senior secured debt ratings of investmentgrade regulated utilities by one notch as a result of revised notching guidelines between senior secured debt ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings both detroit edison’s and michcon’s senior debt ratings were upgraded to a2 from a3 in january 2010 standard  poor’s raised its outlook on dte energy back to stable and raised the shortterm credit ratings for dte energy detroit edison and michcon back to a2 from a3 we have experienced an improvement in our ability to issue commercial paper since the restoration of our shortterm ratings shortterm borrowings principally in the form of commercial paper provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities potential instability in the credit markets and any lowering of ratings may impact future access to the commercial paper markets which may require us to draw on our backup facilities 

the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally recognized credit rating agencies all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities 

 

 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

regulation 

 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses detroit edison and michcon are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment 

 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

derivatives and hedging activities 

 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by detroit edison and michcon meet the criteria specified for this exception 

 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on inputs which 

refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs the fair value of derivative contracts is determined from a combination of active quotes published indexes and mathematical valuation models we generally derive the pricing for our contracts from active quotes or external resources actively quoted indexes include exchangetraded positions such as the new york mercantile exchange and the intercontinental exchange and overthecounter positions for which broker quotes are available for periods in which external market data is not readily observable we estimate value using mathematical valuation models valuation models require various inputs and assumptions including forward prices volatility interest rates and exercise periods for those inputs which are not observable we use modelbased extrapolation proxy techniques or historical analysis to derive the required valuation inputs we periodically update our policy and valuation methodologies for changes in market liquidity and other assumptions which may impact the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts 

 

the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our forward contracts see sensitivity analysis in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see also the fair value section herein see notes 4 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and management’s assessment of existing economic conditions customer trends and other factors the allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances as a result of the reduction in past due receivables in 2009 our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased in 2009 compared to an increase in 2008 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates as part of the 2005 gas rate order for michcon the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses the mpsc provided for a similar tracking mechanism for detroit edison in its rate order received january 2010 however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in light of volatile energy prices and deteriorating economic conditions would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 

 

asset impairments 

 

goodwill 

 

certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations we perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in performing step 1 of the impairment test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit step 2 of the test would be performed step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value if lower as of the test date 

 

for step 1 of the test we estimate the reporting unit’s fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance we also employ marketbased valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique 

 

we performed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2009 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed we also compared the 

aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to factors such as 1 an acquisition control premium the price in excess of a stock’s market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity and 2 the market’s apparent discounting of dte energy’s stock price due to ongoing uncertainty regarding the existing regulatory and automotive industry environment and dte energy’s diverse nonutility business portfolio the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows 

 

as of october 1 2009 valuation date 

 

 

 

 

  

the gas utility reporting unit passed step 1 of the impairment test by a narrow margin the narrow excess of fair value over carrying value is largely due to relatively low market values and market multiples of comparable entities referenced in our valuation further declines in market multiples negative regulatory actions or other disruptions in cash flows for the gas utility reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the foreseeable future for example at the current discount rate and holding all other variables constant a 05x decrease in the terminal multiple would lower the fair value by approximately 130 million at the lower fair value the gas utility reporting unit would likely fail step 1 of the test potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill following completion of the step 2 analysis 

 

we perform an annual impairment test each october in between annual tests we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

 

we monitor dte energy’s stock price in relation to its book value per share dte’s stock price declined significantly during the first quarter of 2009 and then increased and continued to recover throughout the rest of 2009 refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a discussion of factors that we considered when assessing triggering events in 2009 

due to the duration and severity of the decline in dte energy’s stock price in the first quarter we performed an interim impairment test for all reporting units with allocated goodwill as of february 28 2009 for the first quarter interim test we updated projected future results cash flows and discount rates to reflect existing regulatory actions and negative impacts from the deterioration in the regional and national economy terminal values that utilize an earnings multiple approach were updated to incorporate the current market values of comparable entities as compared to the annual test performed in the fourth quarter of 2008 the valuations were negatively impacted by existing market factors with particular downward pressure on market multiples all reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test 

 

we identified a trigger for our energy services reporting unit related to longlived asset impairment tests that were performed during the second quarter on certain automotiverelated project companies the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill therefore the reporting unit passed step 1 of the impairment test as compared to the first quarter interim test the second quarter valuation was favorably impacted by increased market multiples and an improved discount rate 

 

longlived assets 

 

we evaluate the carrying value of our longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require us to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact our earnings see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

the company’s power and industrial projects segment has longterm contracts with gm to provide onsite energy services at certain of its manufacturing and administrative facilities the longterm contracts provide for full recovery of its investment in the event of early termination at december 31 2009 the book value of longlived assets used in the servicing of these facilities was approximately 65 million certain of these longlived assets have been funded by nonrecourse financing totaling approximately 56 million at december 31 2009 the company’s power and industrial projects segment also has an equity investment of approximately 51 million in an entity which provides onsite services to chrysler manufacturing facilities chrysler’s performance under the longterm contracts for services is guaranteed by daimler north america corporation daimler a subsidiary of daimler ag the longterm contracts and the supporting daimler guarantee provide for full recovery of the company’s investment in the event of early termination or default chrysler has announced the closure of one site that is under a longterm service contract with the company through december 31 2009 to the extent that chrysler has not been performing in accordance with its contracts daimler has been performing under its guarantee therefore the company believes that it will recover its investment in the event of a facility closure or a chrysler default 

 

the company determined that the gm and chrysler bankruptcy filings were triggering events to assess certain automotiverelated longlived assets for impairment and as of june 30 2009 the company performed an impairment analysis on these assets based on its undiscounted cash flow projections and fair value calculations the company determined that it did not have an impairment loss at june 30 2009 we also determined that we did not have an other than temporary decline in our chryslerrelated equity investment there were no new events occurring during the third and fourth quarters that would negatively impact the assumptions made for the second quarter impairment analysis therefore no triggering events were identified during the remainder of 2009 the company’s assumptions and conclusions may change in the future and we could have an impairment loss if certain facilities are not utilized as currently anticipated 

pension and postretirement costs 

 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the company the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required we consider historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

 

we had pension costs for pension plans of 58 million in 2009 24 million in 2008 and 76 million in 2007 postretirement benefits costs for all plans were 205 million in 2009 142 million in 2008 and 188 million in 2007 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2009 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 875 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets our 2010 expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 45 in equity markets 25 in fixed income markets and 30 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe that 875 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2010 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

 

we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for our pension plans we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized financial markets in 2009 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains as of december 31 2009 we had 612 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for our postretirement benefit plans we use fair value when determining the mrv of postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased from 69 at december 31 2008 to 59 at december 31 2009 we estimate that our 2010 total pension costs will approximate 110 million compared to 58 million in 2009 due to 2008 financial market losses and a decreased discount rate partially offset by substantial 2009 and planned 2010 contributions coupled with greater than expected 2009 financial market returns our 2010 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 167 million compared to 205 million in 2009 primarily due to company specific health care trends and favorable 2009 investment returns mitigated by a decreased discount rate future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design the pension cost tracking mechanism that provided for recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below amounts reflected in detroit edison’s base rates at the request of detroit edison was not reauthorized by the mpsc in its rate order effective 

january 1 2009 in april 2005 the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of michcon’s negative pension expense michcon records a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2009 pension costs by approximately 29 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2009 pension costs by approximately 15 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2009 by approximately 30 million 

 

in 2008 we changed the measurement date of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from november 30 to december 31 as a result we recognized adjustments of 17 million 9 million aftertax and 4 million to retained earnings and regulatory liabilities respectively which represents approximately one month of pension and other postretirement benefit cost for the period from december 1 2007 to december 31 2008 

 

the value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets was 34 billion at december 31 2009 and 28 billion at december 31 2008 at december 31 2009 our pension plans were underfunded by 887 million and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 13 billion the 2009 and 2008 funding levels were generally similar because of positive investment performance returns and plan sponsor contributions in 2009 largely offset by the decreased discount rates 

 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets we made contributions to our pension plans of 200 million and 100 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively also we contributed 100 million to our pension plans in january 2010 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making up to an additional 100 million contribution to our pension plans in 2010 and up to 11 billion over the next five years we made postretirement benefit plan contributions of 205 million and 116 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in detroit edison’s and michcon’s base rates as a result we expect to make up to a 130 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2010 and subject to mpsc funding requirements up to 765 million over the next five years the planned contributions will be made in cash dte energy common stock or a combination of cash and stock

legal reserves 

 

we are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us 

 

insured and uninsured risks 

 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure the maximum selfinsured retention for various risks is as follows property damage 10 million general liability 7 million workers’ compensation 9 million and auto liability 7 million we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported ibnr liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate as of december 31 2009 this ibnr liability was approximately 38 million 

accounting for tax obligations 

 

we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold we also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters 

 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that we believe will be realized in future periods we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 are appropriately accounted the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material

fair value 

 

derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power gas oil and certain coal forwards futures options and swaps and foreign exchange contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives include proprietary gas inventory gas storage and transportation arrangements and gas and oil reserves see notes 4 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

as a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of nonderivative gas storage transportation and power contracts consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in dte energy’s reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

 

the company manages its marktomarket mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year the following tables contain the four categories of activities represented by their operating characteristics and key risks

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market price risk 

 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

 

the electric and gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations however the company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the form of pscr and gcr regulatory raterecovery mechanisms in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the gas utility gas utility manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of longterm storage contracts the company has tracking mechanisms to mitigate a portion of losses related to uncollectible accounts receivable at michcon and detroit edison the company is exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

 

our gas storage and pipelines business segment has limited exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and manages its exposure through the sale of longterm storage and transportation contracts 

 

our unconventional gas production business segment has exposure to natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil price fluctuations these commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations to manage this exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts 

 

our power and industrial projects business segment is subject to electricity natural gas coal and coalbased product price risk and other risks associated with the weakened us economy to the extent that 

commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of longterm contracts we manage this exposure using forward energy capacity and futures contracts 

 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas crude oil heating oil and foreign exchange price fluctuations these risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

 

credit risk 

 

bankruptcies 

 

the company purchases and sells electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail financial and other industries certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss the company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

 

the company’s utilities and certain nonutility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive industry including gm ford motor company ford and chrysler and many of their vendors and suppliers chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection on april 30 2009 we have reserved approximately 9 million of prepetition accounts receivable related to chrysler as of december 31 2009 gm filed for bankruptcy protection on june 1 2009 we have reserved or written off approximately 5 million of prepetition accounts and notes receivable related to gm as of december 31 2009 closing of gm or chrysler plants or other facilities that operate within detroit edison’s service territory will also negatively impact the company’s operating revenues in future periods in 2009 gm and chrysler each represented two percent of our annual electric sales volumes respectively gm and chrysler have an immaterial impact to michcon’s revenues 

 

other 

 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

 

trading activities 

 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internally 

generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

interest rate risk 

 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2009 we had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately five percent excluding securitized debt 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

the company has foreign exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations we have entered into a series of exchange forward contracts through january 2013 additionally we may enter into fair value exchange hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans 

 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

 

the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange forward contracts the commodity contracts and foreign exchange risk 

listed below principally relate to our energy marketing and trading activities the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2009 and 2008 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values 

 

the results of the sensitivity analysis calculations as of december 31 2009 and 2008

nonutility operations 

 

  

corporate  other includes various holding company activities holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

 

 

refer to our management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 of this report for an indepth analysis of each segment’s financial results a description of each business unit follows 

 

electric utility 

 

description 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison our generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdeq electricity is generated from our several fossil plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant and a nuclear plant and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to four major classes of customers residential commercial industrial and wholesale principally throughout southeastern michigan 

revenue by service 

 

 

 

 

  

weather economic factors competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages restoration and other costs associated with stormrelated power outages can negatively impact earnings in the december 23 2008 mpsc rate order for detroit edison a tracking mechanism was approved that provides for an annual reconciliation for restoration costs storm and nonstorm using a base expense level of 110 million per year our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on detroit edison 

 

fuel supply and purchased power 

 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have eight longterm and two shortterm contracts for a total purchase of approximately 26 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered in 2009 and 2010 we also have eight contracts for the purchase of approximately 6 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2009 through 2011 all of these contracts have fixed prices we have approximately 84 of our 2009 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have longterm transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities 

 

detroit edison participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles 

 

properties 

 

detroit edison owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2008 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

detroit edison owns and operates 678 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33436000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 419600 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 21634000 kva 

circuit miles of distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2008 

 

electric distribution 

 

 

 

there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between detroit edison and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission and connect to neighboring energy companies 

 

regulation 

 

detroit edison’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edison’s nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

 

see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

energy assistance programs 

 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to detroit edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses detroit edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

 

strategy and competition 

 

we strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast michigan we can accomplish this goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable lowcost supplier of electricity to ensure generation reliability we continue to invest in our generating plants which will improve both plant availability and operating efficiencies we also are making capital investments in areas that have a positive impact on reliability and environmental compliance with the goal of high customer satisfaction 

 

our distribution operations focus on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service we seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

 

the electric customer choice program in michigan allows all of our electric customers to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers of generation services customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 3 of retail sales in 2008 4 in 2007 and 6 of 

such sales in 2006 customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose mpscauthorized full service rates exceed their cost of service mpsc rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 percent cap on the total potential customer choice related migration mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric customer choice on our financial performance recent higher wholesale electric prices have also resulted in many former electric customer choice customers migrating back to detroit edison for electric generation service when market conditions are favorable we sell power into the wholesale market in order to lower costs to fullservice customers 

 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term in 2008 the michigan legislature passed a comprehensive reform package that requires michigan utilities to serve ten percent of their retail sales from renewable energy sources by 2015 in december 2008 detroit edison issued a request for proposal to purchase michiganbased renewable energy credits 

 

gas utility 

 

description 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

 

revenue by service 

 

 

 

  

our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is 

largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter 

 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas utility segment 

 

natural gas supply 

 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 28 bcf with approximately 68 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2008 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to nymex and published price indices to approximate current market prices 

 

properties 

 

we own distribution transmission and storage properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1181000 service lines and approximately 1324000 active meters we own approximately 2000 miles of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas we also own four carbon dioxide processing facilities 

 

we own properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 132 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties most of our distribution and transmission property is located on property owned by others and used by us through easements permits or licenses substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions 

 

our primary longterm transportation contracts are as follows 

 

 

 

we own 830 miles of transportation and gathering nonutility pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of michigan our hawes pipeline project is currently under construction and will add an additional 10 miles of pipeline when completed in early 2009 we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capitallease arrangement see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

regulation 

 

we are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters michcon’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

 

see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

energy assistance program 

 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses michcon’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of governmentfunded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas in michigan as a result of more efficient furnaces and appliances and customer conservation due to high natural gas prices and economic conditions we expect future sales volumes to decline we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

 

our extensive transmission pipeline system has enabled us to market 400 to 500 bcf annually for intermediate transportation services and storage services for michigan gas producers marketers distribution companies and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

 

michcon’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to michcon’s customers as well as sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three years prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher but more volatile than for longer periods prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and natural gas pricing 

 

nonutility operations 

 

gas midstream 

 

description 

 

gas midstream owns partnership interests in two interstate transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage fields the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by longterm fixedprice revenue contracts we have a partnership interest in vector pipeline vector an interstate transmission pipeline which connects michigan to chicago and ontario we also hold partnership interests in millennium pipeline company which indirectly connects southern new york state to upper midwestcanadian supply while 

providing transportation service into the new york city markets we have storage assets in michigan capable of storing up to 87 bcf in natural gas storage fields located in southeast michigan the washington 10 and 28 storage facilities are high deliverability storage fields having bidirectional interconnections with vector pipeline and michcon providing our customers access to the chicago michigan other midwest and ontario market centers 

 

our customers include various utilities pipelines and producers and marketers 

 

properties 

 

the gas midstream business holds the following property 

 

 

 

the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations pursuant to an operating agreement michcon provides physical operations maintenance and technical support for the washington 28 and washington 10 storage facilities 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our gas midstream business expects to continue its steady growth plan the gas midstream business focuses on asset development opportunities in the midwesttonortheast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand we expect much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the us to occur within the midatlantic and new england regions we forecast these regions will require incremental pipeline and gas storage infrastructure necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet growing demand vector is an interstate pipeline that is filling a large portion of that need and is complemented by our michigan storage facilities we will complete the shelby 2 storage field at our washington 10 storage complex by 2010 with an additional 3 bcf of capacity additions once completed the combined capacity for washington 10 and washington 28 will be approximately 90 bcf vector pipeline received ferc approval in june 2008 to build an additional compressor station in michigan and to expand the vector pipeline by approximately 100 mmcfd to 13 bcfd with a proposed inservice date of november 1 2009 gas midstream has a 26 percent ownership interest in millennium pipeline which is capable of transporting 525000 dthd of natural gas across the southern tier of new york towards new york city millennium was placed inservice december 2008 we plan to expand existing assets and develop new assets that are typically supported with longterm customer commitments 

 

unconventional gas production 

 

description 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production within the barnett shale in north texas in june 2007 we sold our antrim shale gas exploration and production business in the northern lower peninsula of michigan for gross proceeds of 1262 billion in january 2008 we sold a portion of our barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately 260 million the properties in the 2008 sale include 75 bcfe of proved reserves on approximately 11000 net acres in the core area of the barnett shale 

in 2008 we added proved reserves of 23 bcfe in the barnett shale resulting in yearend total proved reserves of 167 bcfe the barnett shale wells yielded 5 bcfe of production in 2008 barnett shale leasehold acres increased to 62395 gross acres 60435 net of interest of others excluding impairments we drilled a total of 37 wells in the barnett shale acreage 

 

our barnett shale gas production requires processing to extract natural gas liquids therefore our wells are dedicated to various gathering and processing companies in the fort worth basin the revenues received for all products are sold at prevailing market based prices 

 

properties 

 

unconventional gas production owns interests in the following producing wells and acreage in the barnett shale as of december 31 

 

 

 

 

  

strategy and competition 

 

we manage and operate our barnett shale gas properties to maximize returns on investment and increase earnings with the overriding goal of optimizing the cost of producing reserves and adding additional proved reserves we will consider potential periodic monetizations where market conditions are appropriate 

from time to time we use financial derivative contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas on our forecasted natural gas sales the following is a summary of the financial contracts in place at december 31 2008 related to barnett shale production 

 

 

 

we continue to invest in our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and anticipate significant opportunities to develop our current position while accumulating additional acreage in and around our existing assets current economic conditions and depressed commodity prices have created challenges and opportunities in the barnett shale while operating margins are expected to be lower than 2008 opportunities exist to reduce operating drilling and completion costs primarily due to the increased availability of drilling rigs and oil field service companies 

 

in 2009 we expect to drill approximately 15 to 25 wells in the barnett shale investment for the area is expected to be approximately 25 million during 2009 

 

power and industrial projects 

 

description 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype services to steel automotive and other industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation and marketing and develop biomass energy projects this business segment provides utilitytype services using project assets usually located on or near the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries 

 

these services include pulverized coal petroleum coke and metallurgical coke supply power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply we own and operate one gasfired peaking electric generating plant two biomassfired electric generating plants and operate one coalfired power plant under contract a third biomassfired electric generating plant is currently under development pending certain regulatory and management approvals with an expected inservice date of january 2010 production tax credits related to two of the coke battery facilities were reinstated for the years 2006 through 2009 the coke battery facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within the steel industry detroit edison provides operations and maintenance services for the pulverized coal facility located at detroit edison’s river rouge power plant 

 

we also provide coal transportation services including fuel transportation storage blending and rail equipment management services our external customers include electric utilities merchant power producers integrated steel mills and large industrial companies with significant energy requirements additionally we participate in coal marketing and the purchase and sale of emissions credits we own and operate a coal transloading terminal in south chicago illinois 

 

we develop own and operate landfill gas recovery systems throughout the united states landfill gas a byproduct of solid waste decomposition is composed of approximately equal portions of methane and carbon dioxide we develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy in addition to providing environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions this business segment performs coal mine methane extraction in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines industrial users or for small power generation projects we own a coal mine methane gathering system and gas processing facility 

 

discontinuance of planned monetization of a portion of our power and industrial projects business — during the third quarter of 2007 we announced our plans to sell a 50 interest in a portfolio of select power and industrial projects during 2008 the united states asset sale market weakened and challenges in 

the debt market persisted as a result of these developments our work on this planned monetization was discontinued 

 

properties 

 

the following are significant properties operated by the power and industrial projects segment 

 

 

landfill gas recovery 

 

 

 

coal transportation and marketing 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

strategy and competition 

 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow our steel renewable power onsite energy coal transportation marketing storage and blending and landfill gas recovery businesses we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties 

 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our interrelated businesses as we expand from our current regional focus as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

 

we intend to focus on the following areas for growth 

 

  

due to a weakened us economy including constricted capital and credit markets we expect significantly lower demand for steel in 2009 impacting the financial performance of our coke battery and pulverized coal operations in addition the automotive sector has been severely impacted by the current economic situation and has resulted in curtailment of production and plant closings we will continue to monitor the steel and automotive industries closely during 2009 

 

our coal transportation and marketing business is one of the leading north american coal marketers trends such as railroad and mining consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing new mines by many mining firms could have an impact on how we compete in the future in 2011 our existing longterm rail transportation contract which gives us a competitive advantage will expire we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers we will seek to build our capacity to transport store and blend greater amounts of coal and expect to continue to grow our business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments 

energy trading 

 

description 

 

energy trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

 

significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipelines and storage and power generation capacity positions most financial instruments are deemed derivatives however gas inventory power transmission pipelines and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting periods we may incur marktomarket gains or losses in one period that could reverse in subsequent periods 

 

strategy and competition 

 

our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric and gas marketers traders utilities and other energy providers the trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating a material credit restriction would negatively impact our financial performance competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a competitive advantage we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk

the synthetic fuel business was presented as a nonutility segment through the third quarter of 2007 due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007 the synthetic fuel business ceased operations and was classified as a discontinued operation as of december 31 2007 synfuel plants chemically changed coal and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code production tax credits were provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and were available through december 31 2007 to optimize income and cash flow from the synfuel operations we sold interests in all nine of the facilities representing 91 of the total production capacity the synthetic fuel plants generated operating losses that were offset by production tax credits 

the value of a production tax credit was adjusted annually by an inflation factor and published annually by the internal revenue service irs the value of production tax credits for synthetic fuel was reduced when the reference price of a barrel of oil exceeded certain thresholds 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented actual costs to comply could vary substantially we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations 

 

 

 

air — detroit edison is subject to the epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 2005 epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions 

 

water — in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of studies to be conducted over the next several years detroit edison may be required to perform some mitigation activities including the possible installation of additional control technologies to reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures however a january 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation resulting in a delay in complying with the regulation in 2008 the us supreme court agreed to review the remanded costbenefit analysis provision of the rule a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2009 concurrently the epa continues to develop a revised rule which is expected to be published in early 2009 

 

manufactured gas plant mgp and other sites — prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas for heating and other uses have been designated as mgp sites gas utility owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites in addition to the mgp sites we are also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including three mgp sites the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations as a result of these determinations we have recorded liabilities related to these sites cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 

nonutility — our nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we are in the process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facility in michigan we expect the project to be completed in the first half of 2009 our nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 

 

global climate change — proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed in the united states to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels there may be legislative and or regulatory action to address the issue of changes in climate that may result from the build up of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere we cannot predict the impact any legislative or regulatory action may have on our operations and financial position 

 

see notes 5 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energy’s utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our utility and nonutility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve our utilities and certain nonutility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive industry which is under considerable financial distress exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions should national or regional economic conditions further decline reduced volumes of electricity and gas and demand for energy services we supply collections of accounts receivable and potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas will result in decreased earnings and cash flow 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us regional and national economic condition s  increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows in addition a reduction in credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energyrelated commodities products and services which would impact our liquidity 

 

our ability to access capital markets at attractive interest rates is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses in recent months the global financial markets have experienced unprecedented instability this systemic marketplace distress is impacting our access to capital and cost of capital this recent turmoil in credit markets has constrained and may again in the future constrain our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt including commercial paper and refinance existing debt we cannot predict the length of time the current worldwide credit situation will continue or the impact on our future operations and our ability to issue debt at reasonable interest rates in addition the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets we have substantial amounts of shortterm credit facilities that expire in 2009 we intend to seek to renew the facilities on or before the expiration dates however we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts which could result in a decrease in amounts available and or an increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our financial performance 

 

poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations our costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets the level of interest rates used to measure 

the required minimum funding levels of the plans future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans the performance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which may fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as was experienced in 2008 will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements also if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from detroit edison or michcon customers the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate however when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the company may take a noncash impairment charge which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations which could be substantial if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows 

 

we are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we do business adverse economic conditions affecting or financial difficulties of counterparties with whom we do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their contractual obligations or cause them to delay such payments or obligations we depend on these counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our cash flows financial position or results of operations 

 

we may not be fully covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism war or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations 

 

we are subject to rate regulation electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers’ rates new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses 

 

michigan’s electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance the electric customer choice program as originally contemplated in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates in addition such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those 

customers due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers mpsc rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a cap on the total potential customer choice related migration recent higher wholesale electric prices have also resulted in some former electric customer choice customers migrating back to detroit edison for electric generation service however even with the electric customer choicerelated relief received in recent detroit edison rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation in the electric customer choice program there continues to be financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and bundled electric service price increases 

 

weather significantly affects operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process 

 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance 

 

the supply and price of fuel and other commodities and related transportation costs may impact our financial results we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate electricity our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers we have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of natural gas also impacts the market for our nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers increased transportation costs could also impact our nonutility businesses 

 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

 

our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change while we cannot provide absolute assurance that our estimates of our barnett gas reserves are accurate great care is exercised in utilizing historical information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of future production and cash flow we estimate proved gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves including factors beyond our control reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves or of cash flows attributable to such reserves is a function of the available data assumptions regarding expenditures for future development and exploration activities and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment additionally reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history development and exploration activities and prices of gas actual future production revenue taxes development expenditures operating expenses quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information we used 

 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources we have generated production tax credits from the synfuel coke 

production landfill gas recovery biomass fired electric generation and gas production operations we have received favorable private letter rulings on all of the synfuel facilities all production tax credits taken after 2003 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows we have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities 

 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries dte energy is a holding company cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented the operations of our fossilfuel generation assets may be significantly impacted 

 

since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

 

terrorism could affect our business damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets by terrorism would impact our operations we have increased security as a result of past events and further security increases are possible 

 

benefits of continuous improvement initiatives could be less than we expect we have a continuous improvement program that is expected to result in significant cost savings actual results achieved through this program could be less than our expectations 

 

a work interruption may adversely affect us unions represent approximately 5000 of our employees a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

 

failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in certain legal regulatory administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings include certain contract disputes environmental reviews and investigations audits inquiries from various regulators and pending judicial matters we cannot predict the final disposition of such 

proceedings we regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss the resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in the period they are resolved 

 

we are aware of attempts by an environmental organization known as the waterkeeper alliance to initiate a criminal action in canada against the company for alleged violations of the canadian fisheries act fines under the relevant canadian statute could potentially be significant to date the company has not been properly served process in this matter nevertheless as a result of a decision by a canadian court a trial schedule has been initiated the company believes the claims of the waterkeeper alliance in this matter are without legal merit and has appealed the court’s decision we are not able to predict or assess the outcome of this action at this time 

 

in february 2008 dte energy was named as one of approximately 24 defendant oil power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in a united states district court dte energy was served with process in march 2008 the plaintiffs the native village of kivalina and city of kivalina which are home to approximately 400 people in alaska claim that the defendants’ business activities have contributed to global warming and as a result higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall and winter as a result the plaintiffs are seeking damages of up to 400 million for relocation costs associated with moving the village to a safer location as well as unspecified attorney’s fees and expenses the defendants filed motions to dismiss the motions are pending before the court dte energy believes this claim is without merit but is not able to predict or assess the outcome of this lawsuit at this time 

 

the city of detroit water and sewer department dwsd has a suit pending in us district court for the eastern district of michigan against ees coke battery llc ees coke which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company alleging that certain constituents of waste water discharged by ees coke into dwsd’s sewer system exceeded the permitted amounts dwsd has requested that ees coke be required to obtain a new permit and to pay fines for past excess amounts dwsd and ees coke have negotiated a consent order to settle this matter that is expected to require ees coke to pay fines in excess of 100000 the consent order is subject to final approval of the court ees coke is making capital improvements that are intended to prevent exceedances of the permitted amounts in the future

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2008 operating revenues in excess of 9 billion and over 24 billion in assets we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout southeastern michigan we operate four energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

 

 

the decrease in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to approximately 370 million in net income resulting from the 2007 gain on the sale of the antrim shale gas exploration and production business of 900 million 580 million aftertax partially offset by losses recognized on related hedges of 323 million 210 million 

aftertax including recognition of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income during 2007 net income in 2008 was also impacted by a gain of 128 million 81 million aftertax on the sale of a portion of the barnett shale properties 

 

the items discussed below influenced our current financial performance and may affect future results 

 

  

utility operations 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison which is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 22 million customers in southeastern michigan 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers throughout michigan michcon also has subsidiaries involved in the gathering processing and transmission of natural gas in northern michigan citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

 

impact of national and regional economic conditions on our utility operations  — revenues from our utility operations follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve our utilities provide services to the domestic automotive industry which is under considerable financial distress exacerbating the decline in regional conditions in 2008 detroit edison experienced a decline in sales in its service territory as compared to 2007 we expect this decline to continue in 2009 as discussed further below deteriorating economic conditions impact our ability to collect amounts due from our customers of our electric and gas utilities and drive higher levels of lost and stolen natural gas at michcon in the face of the economic conditions we are actively managing our cash capital expenditures cost structure and liquidity to maintain our financial strength 

 

effects of weather on utility operations  — earnings from our utility operations are seasonal and very sensitive to weather electric utility earnings are primarily dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utility’s results are primarily dependent on cold winter weather during the year ended december 31 2008 we experienced colder weather than the year ended december 31 2007 

 

additionally we frequently experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages restoration and other costs associated with stormrelated power outages lowered pretax earnings by 61 million in 2008 68 million in 2007 and 46 million in 2006 

 

collectibility of accounts receivable on utility operations  — both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables which is primarily attributable to economic conditions including high levels of 

unemployment and home foreclosures high energy prices and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers have also impacted our accounts receivable 

 

we have taken actions to manage the level of past due receivables including customer disconnections contracting with collection agencies and working with michigan officials and others to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers 

 

our uncollectible accounts expense for the two utilities increased to 213 million in 2008 from 135 million in 2007 and from 123 million in 2006 

 

the april 2005 mpsc gas rate order provided for an uncollectible trueup mechanism for michcon the uncollectible trueup mechanism enables michcon to recover ninety percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each year and 37 million after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc the mpsc approved the 2005 annual reconciliation in december 2006 allowing michcon to surcharge 11 million beginning in january 2007 the mpsc approved the 2006 annual reconciliation in december 2007 allowing michcon to surcharge 33 million beginning in january 2008 in december 2008 michcon received authorization to surcharge 34 million including a 1 million uncollected balance from the 2005 surcharge beginning in january 2009 we accrue interest income on the outstanding balances 

 

impact of regulatory decisions on utility operations  — on december 23 2008 the mpsc issued an order in detroit edison’s february 20 2008 updated rate case filing the mpsc approved an annual revenue increase of 84 million effective january 14 2009 or a 20 average increase in detroit edison’s annual revenue requirement for 2009 included in the approved 84 million increase in revenues was a return on equity of 11 on an expected 49 equity and 51 debt capital structure 

 

other key aspects of the mpsc order include the following 

 

  

the mpsc issued an order on august 31 2006 approving a settlement agreement providing for an annualized rate reduction of 53 million for 2006 for detroit edison effective september 5 2006 beginning january 1 2007 and continuing until april 13 2008 rates were reduced by an additional 26 million for a total reduction of 79 million annually detroit edison experienced a rate reduction of approximately 76 million in 2007 and approximately 25 million during the period the rate reduction was in effect for 2008 as a result of this order the revenue reduction was net of the recovery of costs associated with the performance excellence process the settlement agreement provided for some level of realignment of the existing rate structure by allocating a larger percentage of the rate reduction to the commercial and industrial customer classes than to the residential customer classes 

 

in august 2006 michcon filed an application with the mpsc requesting permission to sell base gas that would become accessible with storage facilities upgrades in december 2006 michcon filed its 20072008 gcr plan case proposing a maximum gcr factor of 849 per mcf in august 2007 a settlement agreement in this proceeding was approved by the mpsc that provides for a sharing with customers of the proceeds from the sale of base gas in addition the agreement provides for a rate case filing moratorium until january 1 2009 

unless certain unanticipated changes occur that impact income by more than 5 million michcon’s gas storage enhancement projects the main subject of the aforementioned settlement have enabled 17 billion cubic feet bcf of gas to become available for cycling under the settlement terms michcon delivered 134 bcf of this gas to its customers through 2007 at a savings to marketpriced supplies of approximately 41 million this settlement also provided for michcon to retain the proceeds from the sale of 36 bcf of base gas of which michcon sold 075 bcf of base gas in 2007 at a pretax gain of 5 million and 284 bcf in december 2008 at a pretax gain of 22 million in july 2008 michcon filed an application with the mpsc requesting permission to sell an additional 4 bcf of base gas that will become available for sale as a result of better than expected operations at its storage fields michcon proposed to sell 13 bcf of the base gas to gcr customers during the 20092010 gcr period at cost and to sell the remaining 27 bcf to nonsystem supply customers in 2009 at market prices michcon requested that the mpsc treat the proceeds from the sale of the 27 bcf of base gas to nonsystem supply customers as a onetime increase in michcon’s net income and not include the proceeds in the calculation of michcon’s revenue requirements in future rate cases 

 

impact of legislation on utility operations  — on september 18 2008 the michigan house of representatives and michigan senate passed a package of bills to establish a comprehensive sustainable longterm energy plan for michigan the governor of michigan signed the bills on october 6 2008 

 

the package of bills includes 

 

  

2008 pa 286 makes the following changes in the regulatory framework for michigan utilities 

 

 32 

  

  

2008 pa 295 establishes renewable energy and energy optimization energy efficiency energy conservation or load management programs in michigan and provides for a separate funding surcharge to pay the cost of those programs in accordance with the new law the mpsc issued a temporary order on december 4 2008 implementing this act within 90 days following the issuance of the temporary order detroit edison is required to file a renewable portfolio standard rps plan with the mpsc in addition detroit edison and michcon are required to file energy optimization plans with the mpsc

impact of increased market demand on coal supply  — our generating fleet produces approximately 79 of its electricity from coal increasing coal demand from domestic and international markets has resulted in volatility and higher prices which are passed to our customers through the pscr mechanism the demand and price volatility have been dampened by the recent economic downturn but are expected to increase as the economy improves in addition difficulty in recruiting workers obtaining environmental permits and finding economically recoverable amounts of new coal have resulted in decreasing coal output from the central appalachian region furthermore as a result of environmental regulation and declining eastern coal stocks demand for cleaner burning western coal has increased 

 

challenges associated with nuclear fuel  — we operate one nuclear facility fermi 2 that undergoes a periodic refueling outage approximately every eighteen months uranium prices have been rising due to supply concerns in the future there may be additional nuclear facilities constructed in the industry that may place additional pressure on uranium supplies and prices we have a contract with the us department of energy doe for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from fermi 2 we are obligated to pay the doe a fee of 1 mill per kwh of fermi 2 electricity generated and sold this fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense delays have occurred in the doe’s program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository we are a party in litigation against the doe for both past and future costs associated with the doe’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the federal nuclear waste policy act of 1982 until the doe is able to fulfill its obligation under the contract we are responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage and have begun work on an onsite dry cask storage facility 

 

nonutility operations 

 

we have made significant investments in nonutility assetintensive businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets skills and expertise specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile as part of a strategic review of our nonutility operations we have taken various actions including the sale of certain nonutility businesses 

 

gas midstream 

 

gas midstream owns partnership interests in two interstate transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage fields the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by longterm fixedprice revenue contracts we have a partnership interest in vector pipeline vector an interstate transmission pipeline which connects michigan to chicago and ontario we also hold partnership interests in millennium pipeline company which indirectly connects southern new york state to upper midwestcanadian supply while providing transportation service into the new york city markets we have storage assets in michigan capable of storing up to 87 bcf in natural gas storage fields located in southeast michigan the washington 10 and 28 storage facilities are high deliverability storage fields having bidirectional interconnections with vector pipeline and michcon providing our customers access to the chicago michigan other midwest and ontario market centers the pipeline business is expanding and building new pipeline capacity to serve markets in northeast united states

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production within the barnett shale in north texas we continue to develop our position here with total leasehold acreage of 62395 60435 acres net of interest of others we continue to acquire select positions in active development areas in the barnett shale to optimize our existing portfolio 

 

monetization of portions of our unconventional gas production business  — in 2008 we sold a portion of our barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately 260 million the properties sold included 75 bcfe of proved reserves on approximately 11000 net acres in the core area of the barnett shale the company recognized a cumulative pretax gain of 128 million 81 million aftertax on the sale during 2008 

we plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties within our barnett shale holdings when conditions are appropriate we invested approximately 96 million in the barnett shale in 2008 and expect to invest approximately 25 million in 2009 during 2009 we expect to drill 15 to 25 new wells and achieve barnett shale production of approximately 56 bcfe of natural gas compared with approximately 5 bcfe in 2008 

 

as a component of our risk management strategy for our barnett shale reserves we hedged a portion of anticipated production from our reserves to secure an attractive investment return as of december 31 2008 we have a series of cash flow hedges for approximately 32 bcf of anticipated barnett gas production through 2010 at an average price of 733 per mcf

power and industrial projects 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation and marketing and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects this business segment provides utilitytype services using project assets usually located on or near the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries 

 

services provided include pulverized coal petroleum coke and metallurgical coke supply power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply we own and operate one gasfired peaking electric generating plant two biomassfired electric generating plants and operate one coalfired power plant a third biomassfired electric generating plant is currently under development pending certain regulatory and management approvals with an expected inservice date of january 2010 this business segment also develops owns and operates landfill gas recovery systems throughout the united states and produces metallurgical coke from three coke batteries the production of coke from two of the coke batteries generates production tax credits the business provides coal transportation — related services including fuel transportation storage blending and rail equipment management services we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers additionally we participate in coal marketing and the purchase and sale of emissions credits this business segment performs coal mine methane extraction in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines industrial users or for small power generation projects 

 

discontinuance of planned monetization of our power and industrial projects business — during the third quarter of 2007 we announced our plans to sell a 50 interest in a portfolio of select power and industrial projects as a result the assets and liabilities of the projects were classified as held for sale at that time during 2008 the united states asset sale market weakened and challenges in the debt market persisted as a result of these developments our work on this planned monetization was discontinued as of june 30 2008 the assets and liabilities of the projects are no longer classified as held for sale 

 

energy trading 

 

energy trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing and trading structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio and the optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies pipelines and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within dte energy 

significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power generation capacity positions most financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas proprietary gas inventory power transmission pipelines and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting periods we may incur marktomarket accounting gains or losses in one period that could reverse in subsequent periods 

 

discontinued operations 

 

synthetic fuel 

 

the synthetic fuel business was presented as a nonutility segment through the third quarter of 2007 due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007 the synthetic fuel business ceased operations and 

 

was classified as a discontinued operation as of december 31 2007 synfuel plants chemically changed coal and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code production tax credits were provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and were available through december 31 2007 to optimize income and cash flow from synfuel operations we sold interests in all nine of the facilities representing 91 of the total production capacity the synthetic fuel plants generated operating losses that were offset by production tax credits 

 

the value of a production tax credit was adjusted annually by an inflation factor and published annually by the irs the value of production tax credits for synthetic fuel was reduced when the reference price of a barrel of oil exceeded certain thresholds the actual tax credit phaseout for 2007 was approximately 67 

 

capital investment 

 

we anticipate significant capital investment across all of our business segments most of our capital expenditures will be concentrated within our utility segments our electric utility segment currently expects to invest approximately 6 billion excluding investments in new generation capacity if any including increased environmental requirements and reliability enhancement projects during the period of 2009 through 2013 our gas utility segment currently expects to invest approximately 750 million to 800 million on system expansion pipeline safety and reliability enhancement projects through the same period we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment due to the economy and credit market conditions we are continually reviewing our capital expenditure commitments for potential reductions and deferrals and plan to adjust spending as appropriate 

 

outlook 

 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth 

 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 

 37 

 

we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

 

results of operations 

 

segments realigned — beginning in the second quarter of 2008 we have realigned our coal transportation and marketing business from the coal and gas midstream segment now the gas midstream segment to the power and industrial projects segment due to changes in how financial information is evaluated and resources allocated to segments by senior management the company’s segment information reflects this change for all periods presented see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further information on this realignment the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments 

 

 

 

 

  

electric utility 

 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison 

 

factors impacting income net income increased 14 million in 2008 and decreased 8 million in 2007 the 2008 increase was primarily due to lower expenses for operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income partly offset by lower gross margins and higher income tax expense the 2007 decrease reflects higher operation and maintenance expenses partially offset by higher gross margins and lower depreciation and amortization expenses 

 

 

 

gross margin decreased 118 million during 2008 and increased 43 million in 2007 the 2008 decrease was due to the unfavorable impacts of weather and service territory performance and the absence of the favorable impact of a may 2007 mpsc order related to the 2005 pscr reconciliation these decreases were partially offset by higher rates attributable to the april 2008 expiration of a rate reduction related to the mpsc show cause proceeding and higher margins due to customers returning from the electric customer choice program the increase in 2007 was attributed to higher margins due to returning sales from electric customer choice the favorable impact of a may 2007 mpsc order related to the 2005 pscr reconciliation and weather related impacts partially offset by lower rates resulting primarily from the august 2006 settlement in the mpsc show cause proceeding and the unfavorable impact of a september 2006 mpsc order related to the 2004 pscr reconciliation revenues include a component for the cost of power sold that is recoverable through the pscr mechanism 

 

the following table displays changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

operation and maintenance expense decreased 100 million in 2008 and increased 86 million in 2007 the decrease in 2008 was due primarily to lower information systems implementation costs of 60 million lower benefit expense of 45 million and lower corporate support expenses of 29 million partially offset by higher uncollectible expenses of 22 million the increase in 2007 is primarily due to higher information systems implementation costs of 30 million higher storm expenses of 22 million increased uncollectible expense of 22 million and higher corporate support expenses of 20 million 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 21 million in 2008 and 45 million in 2007 the 2008 decrease was due primarily to decreased amortization of regulatory assets the 2007 decrease was due primarily to a 2006 net stranded cost writeoff of 112 million related to the september 2006 mpsc order regarding stranded costs and a 13 million decrease in our asset retirement obligation at our fermi 1 nuclear facility partially offset by 58 million of increased amortization of regulatory assets and 13 million of higher depreciation expense due to increased levels of depreciable plant assets 

 

taxes other than income decreased 45 million in 2008 due to the michigan single business tax sbt expense in 2007 which was replaced with the michigan business tax mbt in 2008 the mbt is accounted for in the income tax provision 

 

asset gains losses and reserves net decreased 9 million in 2008 and increased 14 million in 2007 due to a 2007 13 million reserve for a loan guaranty related to detroit edison’s former ownership of a steam heating business now owned by thermal ventures ii lp thermal 

 

other income and deductions expense increased 6 million in 2008 and decreased 17 million in 2007 the 2008 increase is attributable to 15 million of investment losses in a trust utilized for retirement benefits and 3 million of miscellaneous expenses offset by higher capitalized interest of 12 million the 2007 decrease is attributable to a 10 million contribution to the dte energy foundation in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 3 million of higher interest income and 17 million of increased miscellaneous utility related services partially offset by 16 million of higher interest expense 

 

outlook  — we will move forward in our efforts to continue to improve the operating performance and cash flow of detroit edison we continue to resolve outstanding regulatory issues by pursuing regulatory andor legislative solutions many of these issues and problems have been addressed by the legislation signed by the governor of michigan in october 2008 discussed more fully in the overview section looking forward additional issues such as volatility in prices for coal and other commodities investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans health care costs and higher levels of capital spending will result in us taking meaningful action to address our costs while continuing to provide quality customer service we will continue to seek opportunities to improve productivity remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

 

unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in reduced demand for electricity in our service territory and increases in our uncollectible accounts receivable the magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies 

 

due to the economy and credit market conditions in the near term we are reviewing our capital expenditure commitments for potential reductions and deferrals and plan to adjust the timing of projects as appropriate long term we will be required to invest an estimated 28 billion on emission controls through 2018 we intend to seek recovery of these investments in future rate cases 

 

additionally our service territory may require additional generation capacity a new baseload generating plant has not been built within the state of michigan in over 20 years should our economic and regulatory environment be conducive to such a significant capital expenditure we may build upgrade or coinvest in a baseload coal facility or a new nuclear plant 

 

on september 18 2008 detroit edison submitted a combined operating license application with the nrc for construction and operation of a possible 1500 mw nuclear power plant at the site of the company’s existing fermi 2 nuclear plant we have not decided on construction of a new baseload nuclear plant however by completing the license application before the end of 2008 we may qualify for financial incentives under the federal energy policy act of 2005 in addition detroit edison is also moving ahead with plans for renewable energy resources and an aggressive energy efficiency program 

 

the following variables either individually or in combination could impact our future results 

 

 41 

 

  

gas utility 

 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens 

 

factors impacting income gas utility’s net income increased 15 million in 2008 and 20 million in 2007 the 2008 and 2007 increases were due primarily to higher gross margins 

 

 

 

gross margin increased 63 million and 19 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in 2008 reflects 49 million from the uncollectible tracking mechanism 15 million related to the impacts of colder weather 10 million favorable result of lower lost gas recognized and higher valued gas received as compensation for transportation of third party customer gas 7 million of 2007 gcr disallowances and 6 million of appliance repair revenue the 2008 improvement was partially offset by 19 million of lower storage services revenue and 12 million from customer conservation and lower volumes the increase in 2007 is primarily due to 21 million from the favorable effects of weather in 2007 and 28 million related to an increase in midstream services including storage and transportation partially offset by a 26 million unfavorable impact in lost gas recognized and 7 million in gcr disallowances revenues include a component for the cost of gas sold that is recoverable through the gcr mechanism 

 

 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 35 million in 2008 and decreased 2 million in 2007 the 2008 increase is primarily attributable to 56 million of higher uncollectible expenses partially offset by 14 million of lower corporate support expenses and 14 million of reduced pension and retiree health benefit costs the increase in uncollectible expense is partially offset by increased revenues from the uncollectible tracking mechanism included in the gross margin discussion the 2007 decrease was attributed to 4 million of lower uncollectible expense and 4 million of reduced corporate support expenses partially offset by 5 million in increased information systems implementation costs 

 

other asset gains losses net increased 23 million in 2008 and 3 million in 2007 both increases are primarily attributable to the sale of base gas 

 

outlook — higher gas prices and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in continued pressure on receivables and working capital requirements that are partially mitigated by the mpsc’s gcr and uncollectible trueup mechanisms we will continue to seek opportunities to improve productivity minimize lost gas remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

 

unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in negative customer growth in our service territory and increases in our uncollectible accounts receivable the magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies 

 

the following variables either individually or in combination could impact our future results 

 

 43 

 

  

nonutility operations 

 

gas midstream 

 

our gas midstream segment consists of our nonutility gas pipelines and storage businesses 

 

factors impacting income net income increased 4 million and 6 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the 2008 increase is due to higher storage revenues related to expansion of capacity and higher other income primarily driven by higher equity earnings from our investments in the vector and millennium pipelines partially offset by a higher tax provision due to the mbt in 2008 net income was higher in 2007 due to higher storage revenues and lower expenses due to the washington 10 restructuring during 2006 

 

 

 

outlook  — our gas midstream business expects to continue its steady growth plan in april 2008 an additional 7 bcf of storage capacity was placed in service future additions to storage capacity of approximately 3 bcf will occur over the next few months vector pipeline placed into service its phase 1 expansion for approximately 200 mmcfd in november 2007 in addition vector pipeline received ferc approval in june 2008 to build one additional compressor station which will expand the vector pipeline by approximately 100 mmcfd with a proposed inservice date of november 2009 adding another compressor station will bring the system from its current capacity of about 12 bcfd up to 13 bcfd in 2009 both the 2007 and 2009 expansion projects are supported by customers under longterm contracts millennium pipeline was placed in service in december 2008 and currently has nearly 85 of its capacity sold to customers under longterm contracts 

 

unconventional gas production 

 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production within the barnett shale in northern texas in june 2007 we sold our antrim shale gas exploration and production business in northern michigan for gross proceeds of 1262 billion 

in january 2008 we sold a portion of our barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately 260 million the properties sold included 75 bcf of proved reserves on approximately 11000 net acres in the core area of the barnett shale we recognized a gain of 128 million 81 million aftertax on the sale in 2008 

 

factors impacting income the 2008 results include the gain recognized on the sale of our barnett shale property described above in addition lower gas sales volumes were offset by higher commodity prices and higher gas and oil production from retained wells in 2008 compared to 2007 the 2007 results reflect the recording of 323 million of losses on financial contracts related to expected antrim gas production and sales through 2013 

 

 

 

operating revenues increased 276 million in 2008 and decreased 327 million in 2007 the 2007 decrease reflects the recording of 323 million of losses during 2007 on financial contracts that hedged our price risk exposure related to expected antrim gas production and sales through 2013 these financial contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in estimated fair value of the contracts reflected in other comprehensive income upon the sale of antrim the financial contracts no longer qualified as cash flow hedges in conjunction with the antrim sale antrim reclassified amounts held in accumulated other comprehensive income reducing operating revenues in the 2007 period by 323 million excluding the impact of the losses on the antrim hedges operating revenues decreased 47 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 the decreases were principally due to lower natural gas sales volumes as a result of our monetization initiatives partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher gas and oil production on retained wells 

 

other assets gains losses net increased 147 million in 2008 due to the gain on sale of barnett shale core properties offset by 8 million of impairment losses primarily related to leases on unproved acreage that expire in 2009 that we do not anticipate developing due to current economic conditions the 30 million decrease in 2007 was primarily due to the recording of impairment losses of 27 million in 2007 related to the writeoff of unproved properties and the expiration of leases in the southern expansion area of the barnett shale 

 

outlook — we plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties within our barnett shale holdings when conditions are appropriate we invested approximately 96 million in the barnett shale in 2008 during 2009 we expect to invest approximately 25 million to drill 15 to 25 new wells and achieve barnett shale production of approximately 5 to 6 bcfe of natural gas from our remaining properties compared with approximately 5 bcfe in 2008 

 

power and industrial projects 

 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utilitytype products and services to industrial commercial and institutional customers provide coal transportation services and marketing and sell electricity from biomassfired energy projects 

during the third quarter of 2007 we announced plans to sell a 50 interest in a portfolio of select power and industrial projects as a result the assets and liabilities of the projects were classified as held for sale at that time and the company ceased recording depreciation and amortization expense related to these assets during the second quarter of 2008 the united states asset sale market weakened and challenges in the debt market persisted as a result of these developments our work on this planned monetization was discontinued as of june 30 2008 the assets and liabilities of the projects were no longer classified as held for sale depreciation and amortization resumed in june 2008 when the assets were reclassified as held and used 

 

factors impacting income net income decreased 9 million in 2008 and increased 107 million in 2007 

 

 

 

operating revenues decreased 257 million in 2008 this was primarily attributable to 177 million of reductions in coal transportation and trading volumes and 28 million for the impact of a customer electing to purchase coal directly from the supplier revenues in 2007 increased 191 million reflecting a new longterm utility services contract with a large automotive company higher coke prices and sales volumes in addition to higher volumes at several other projects additionally revenue was earned for a onetime fee from the sale of an asset we operated for a third party in 2007 revenues were impacted by higher synfuel related volumes and increases in trading volumes related to both coal and emissions 

 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 244 million in 2008 and increased 171 million in 2007 the 2008 decrease mostly reflects 174 million of lower coal transportation costs driven by reduced sales combined with a reduction in coal trading results the 2007 increase was due to higher synfuel related production and higher trading volumes related to coal and emissions 

 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 7 million in 2008 and 8 million in 2007 due primarily to the suspension of 6 million of depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to the assets held for sale the sale of a generation facility during the year and reduced depreciation expense as a result of asset impairments at several biomass landfill sites in 2006 

 

other assets gains losses reserves and impairments net expense decreased 6 million in 2008 and decreased 76 million in 2007 the 2008 decrease is primarily attributable to a loss of approximately 19 million related to the valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation and amortization upon reclassification of certain project assets as held and used partially offsetting the 2008 loss were gains attributable to the sale of one of our coke battery projects where the proceeds were dependent on future production the 2007 decrease is due to impairments recognized in 2006 at natural gas fired generating plants longlived assets at several landfill gas recovery sites and fixed assets and patents at our waste coal recovery business 

other income and deductions were higher by 9 million in 2008 due primarily to higher intercompany interest the 2007 decrease was due primarily to a realized gain of 8 million on the sale of a 50 percent equity interest in a natural gasfired generating plant and a 4 million gain recognized in 2007 on an installment sale of a coke battery facility 

 

outlook  — the deterioration in the us economy is expected to continue to negatively impact our customers in the steel industry and we expect a corresponding reduction in demand for metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to these customers in 2009 we supply onsite energy services to the domestic automotive manufacturers who have also been negatively affected by the economic downturn and constriction in the capital and credit markets our onsite energy services are delivered in accordance with the terms of longterm contracts which include termination payments in the event of plant closures or other events of default and have not been significantly impacted by the financial distress experienced by the automotive manufacturers further plant closures bankruptcies or a federal government mandated restructuring program could have a significant impact on the results of our onsite energy projects we continue to monitor developments in this sector in 2009 we expect our coal transportation and marketing business to positively contribute to the results of this segment as our coal transportation storage and blending services continue to grow in 2011 our existing longterm rail transportation contract which gives us a competitive advantage will expire we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers 

 

power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop additional onsite energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers that are experiencing capital constraints due to the economic downturn we will also continue to look for opportunities to acquire onsite energy projects and biomass fired generating projects for advantageous prices 

 

energy trading 

 

our energy trading segment focuses on physical power and gas marketing structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s asset portfolio optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power transmission and generating capacity positions 

 

factors impacting income net income increased 10 million in 2008 and decreased 64 million in 2007 

 

 

 

gross margin increased 35 million in 2008 and decreased 103 million in 2007 the 2008 increase is due to higher unrealized margin of 66 million offset by a decrease in realized margin of 31 million the increase in unrealized margins includes 18 million in improved gains in the gas trading strategy 26 million gains on economic hedges of storage positions due to falling gas prices and the absence of 30 million in marktomarket losses in june 2007 reflecting revisions of valuation estimates for natural gas contracts offset by 10 million in losses on economic hedges in our gas transportation strategy the decrease in realized 

margin is due to unfavorability of 28 million primarily from our power marketing and transmission optimization strategies 34 million of unfavorability in our gas storage and full requirements strategies due to falling prices in 2008 offset by 31 million of improvement in our gas trading strategy the 2007 decrease is attributable to approximately 30 million of unrealized losses for gas contracts related to revisions of valuation estimates for the longdated portion of our energy contracts and 32 million due to absence of unrealized gains on economic storage hedges and positions in our full requirements strategy timing differences from 2005 that largely reversed and favorably impacted 2006 margin resulted in 11 million of realized unfavorability in 2007 additionally margins were unfavorably impacted by 13 million of lower realized gains from reduced merchant storage capacity in 2007 and 12 million of unfavorability in realized power positions 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 10 million in 2008 and decreased 7 million in 2007 the 2008 increase is due to higher payroll and incentive costs and allocated corporate costs the 2007 decrease was due primarily to lower incentive expenses 

 

outlook  — significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and power generation capacity positions most financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas proprietary gas inventory power transmission pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are markedtomarket without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets a source of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle which does not coincide with the calendar year but runs annually from april of one year to march of the next year our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of storage with futures forwards and swaps this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods

corporate  other 

 

corporate  other includes various holding company activities and holds certain nonutility debt and energyrelated investments 

 

factors impacting income corporate  other results decreased by 597 million in 2008 and increased by 563 million in 2007 this is mostly attributable to the 2007 gain on the sale of the antrim shale gas exploration and production business for approximately 900 million 580 million aftertax and variations in intercompany interest 

 

discontinued operations 

 

synthetic fuel 

 

the company discontinued the operations of our synthetic fuel production facilities as of december 31 2007 synfuel plants chemically changed coal and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code production tax credits were provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and were available through december 31 2007 the synthetic fuel business generated operating losses that were offset by production tax credits 

 

factors impacting income synthetic fuel net income decreased 185 million in 2008 and increased 157 million in 2007 the decrease in 2008 was due to the cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at december 31 2007 and the final determination of the 2007 irs reference price and inflation factor in 2008 the increase in 2007 was due to synfuel production occurring throughout the year in comparison to 2006 when production was idled at all nine of our synfuel facilities from may to october 2006 and higher income from oil price hedges partially offset by a higher phaseout of production tax credits due to high oil prices 

 

 

 

 

  

operating revenues decreased 1062 million in 2008 and increased 206 million in 2007 the 2008 drop is due to the cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at december 31 2007 the 2008 activity reflects the increased value of 2007 synfuel production as a result of final determination of the irs reference price and inflation factor synfuel production was higher in 2007 in comparison to 2006 when production was idled at all nine of our synfuel facilities from may to october 2006 

 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 1256 million in 2008 and increased 246 million in 2007 the 2008 reduction is due to the cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at december 31 2007 activity for 2008 reflects adjustments to 2007 contractually defined cost sharing mechanisms with suppliers as determined by applying the actual phaseout percentage the 2007 increase reflects synfuel production occurring throughout 2007 in comparison to 2006 when production was idled at all nine of our synfuel facilities from may to october 2006 

 

depreciation and amortization expense was lower by 30 million in 2007 as a result of reductions in asset retirement obligations in 2007 and the impairment of fixed assets at all nine synfuel projects in 2006 

 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net decreased 249 million in 2008 and increased 320 million in 2007 the 2008 decrease was due to the cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at december 31 2007 and reflects the impact of reserve adjustments for the final phaseout percentage and trueups of final payments and distributions to partners 

 

the increase in gains in 2007 reflects the annual partner payment adjustment recognition of certain fixed gains that were reserved during the comparable 2006 period higher hedge gains and the impact of onetime impairment charges and fixed note reserves recorded in 2006 in 2007 and 2006 we deferred gains from the sale of the synfuel facilities including a portion of gains related to fixed payments due to the increase in oil prices we recorded accruals for contractual partners’ obligations of 130 million in 2007 and 79 million in 2006 reflecting the probable refund of amounts equal to our partners’ capital contributions or for operating losses that would normally be paid by our partners in 2007 we reversed 3 million of other synfuelrelated reserves and impairments and in 2006 recorded 78 million of other synfuelrelated reserves and impairments to economically hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices and the resulting reduction in synfuel sales proceeds we entered into derivative and other contracts the derivative contracts are markedtomarket with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains we recorded net 2007 synfuel hedge marktomarket gains of 196 million compared with net 2006 synfuel hedge marktomarket gains of 60 million 

the following table displays the various pretax components that comprise the determination of synfuel gains and losses in 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

minority interest decreased by 190 million and 63 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the 2008 reduction is due to the cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at december 31 2007 the 2007 decrease reflects the lower net operating losses in 2007 due to the asset impairment charge we incurred in 2006 partially offset by an increased discount on higher sales levels for 2007

cumulative effect of accounting changes 

 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 fair value measurements  the cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of sfas no 157 represented a 4 million increase to the january 1 2008 balance of retained earnings as permitted by fasb staff position fas 1572 we have deferred the effective date of sfas no 157 as it pertains to nonfinancial assets and liabilities to january 1 2009 see also the “fair value” section 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  the cumulative effect of the adoption of fin 48 represented a 5 million reduction to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings 

 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment using the modified prospective transition method the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas 123r was an increase in net income of 1 million as a result of estimating forfeitures for previously granted stock awards and performance shares 

 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

cash requirements 

 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends during 2008 our cash requirements were met primarily through operations and from our nonutility monetization program 

 

our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2009 of up to 11 billion the capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures we incurred environmental expenditures of approximately 270 million in 2008 and we expect over 29 billion of future capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both existing and proposed new requirements we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment 

we expect nonutility capital spending will approximate 175 million to 300 million annually for the next several years capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

 

due to the economy and credit market conditions we are continually reviewing our capital expenditure commitments for potential reductions and deferrals and plan to adjust spending as appropriate 

 

longterm debt maturing or remarketing in 2009 totals approximately 350 million 

 

 

 

cash from operating activities 

 

a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs 

 

cash from operations totaling 16 billion in 2008 increased 434 million from the comparable 2007 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net income after adjusting for noncash and nonoperating items depreciation depletion and amortization deferred taxes and gains on sales of assets and cash payments received related to our synfuel program hedges 

cash from operations totaling 11 billion in 2007 decreased 331 million from the comparable 2006 period the operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects a decrease in net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation depletion and amortization and deferred taxes and gains on sales of businesses the decrease was mostly driven by taxes attributable to our nonutility monetization program 

 

cash from investing activities 

 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets while cash outflows are primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets or matured fully valued assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements capital spending within our nonutility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we initially invest based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

 

net cash used for investing activities was approximately 15 billion in 2008 compared with cash from investing activities of 330 million in 2007 the change was primarily driven by our nonutility monetization program and final refund payments to our synfuel partners in 2008 

 

net cash from investing activities increased 15 billion in 2007 due primarily to the sale of our antrim shale gas exploration and production business and lower capital expenditures 

 

cash from financing activities 

 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations 

 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 to 52 to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our longterm debt and strengthening our balance sheet 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 84 million in 2008 compared to net cash used of approximately 15 billion for the same period in 2007 the change was primarily attributable to increased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt net of debt redemptions and repurchases and lower repurchases of common stock 

 

net cash used for financing activities increased 13 billion in 2007 primarily related to the repurchase of common stock a decrease in shortterm borrowings and a lower level of longterm debt issuances partially offset by lower debt redemptions 

 

outlook 

 

we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily due to improvements from higher earnings at our utilities we may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our pscr and gcr costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of mpsc orders energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our longterm capital projects 

recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on financial market activities including extreme volatility in security prices and severely diminished liquidity and credit availability pursuant to the failures of large financial institutions the credit situation rapidly evolved into a global crisis resulting in a number of international bank failures and declines in various stock indexes and large reductions in the market value of equities and commodities worldwide the crisis has led to increased volatility in the markets for both financial and physical assets as the failures of large financial institutions resulted in sharply reduced trading volumes and activity the effects of the credit situation will continue to be monitored 

 

we have experienced difficulties in accessing the commercial paper markets for shortterm financing needs and an extended period of distress in the capital markets could have a negative impact on our liquidity in the future shortterm borrowings principally in the form of commercial paper provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities beginning late in the third quarter of 2008 access to the commercial paper markets was sharply reduced and as a result we drew against our unsecured credit lines to supplement other sources of funds to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we continue to access the longterm bond markets as evidenced by certain financings completed in the fourth quarter of 2008 since december 31 2008 we have benefited from substantially improved liquidity and pricing in the commercial paper market as a result we anticipate repayment of our credit facility draws during the first quarter of 2009 

 

approximately 12 billion of our total shortterm credit arrangements of 21 billion expire between june and december 2009 with the remainder expiring in october 2010 in anticipation of a significantly more challenging credit market we expect to pursue the renewal of 975 million of our syndicated revolving credit facilities before their expiration in october given current conditions in the credit markets we anticipate that the new facilities will vary significantly from our current facilities with respect to such items as bank participation allocation levels pricing and covenants we are currently in discussions with our existing bank group and actively pursuing potential new candidates for inclusion as we anticipate that a number of banks in our current bank group will elect not to participate in the renewal or will alter their commitment level initial indications are that pricing is likely to be significantly higher due to marketwide repricing of risk multiyear agreements are still possible however the recent trend in the marketplace is toward 364 day facilities several bilateral credit facilities totaling approximately 200 million will also expire in 2009 and we are evaluating the need for replacement 

 

our benefit plans have not experienced any direct significant impact on liquidity or counterparty risk due to the turmoil in the financial markets as a result of losses experienced in the financial markets our benefit plan assets experienced negative returns for 2008 which will result in increased benefit costs and higher contributions in 2009 and future years than in the recent past or than originally planned 

 

we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there has not been a significant impact to our financial position and results of operations in 2008 while the impact of continued market volatility and turmoil in the credit markets cannot be predicted we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs however virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows 

 

see notes 11 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

credit ratings 

 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

 

as part of the normal course of business detroit edison michcon and various nonutility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity natural gas coal capacity storage and other energyrelated products and services certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the credit rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade certain of these contracts for detroit edison and michcon contain similar provisions in the event that the credit rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial also upon a downgrade below investment grade we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if the parent is downgraded below investment grade our nonutility businesses especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity while we currently do not anticipate such a 

downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally recognized credit rating agencies all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities 

 

 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

regulation 

 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of our businesses management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

derivatives and hedging activities 

 

risk management and trading activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted sfas no 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities all derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position derivatives are measured at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge sfas no 133 also provides a scope exception for contracts that meet the normal purchases and normal sales criteria specified in the standard the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires among other things physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value essentially all of the commodity contracts entered into by detroit edison and michcon meet the criteria specified for this exception 

 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fair value of derivative contracts is 

determined from a combination of active quotes published indexes and mathematical valuation models we generally derive the pricing for our contracts from active quotes or external resources actively quoted indexes include exchangetraded positions such as the new york mercantile exchange and the intercontinental exchange and overthecounter positions for which broker quotes are available for periods in which external market data is not readily observable we estimate value using mathematical valuation models valuation models require various inputs and assumptions including forward prices volatility interest rates and exercise periods for those inputs which are not observable we use modelbased extrapolation proxy techniques or historical analysis to derive the required valuation inputs we periodically update our policy and valuation methodologies for changes in market liquidity and other assumptions which may impact the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts liquidity and transparency in energy markets where fair value is evidenced by market quotes current market transactions or other observable market information may require us to record gains or losses at inception of new derivative contracts 

 

the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our forward contracts see sensitivity analysis in the fair value section see notes 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers historical trends economic conditions age of receivables and other information higher customer bills due to increased electricity and gas prices the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2008 and 2007 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates as part of the 2005 gas rate order for michcon the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible accounts tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses detroit edison has requested a similar tracking mechanism in its rate request filed january 26 2009 however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in light of volatile energy prices and deteriorating economic conditions would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 

 

asset impairments 

 

goodwill 

 

certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in performing these impairment tests we estimate the reporting unit’s fair value using standard valuation techniques including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

 

as of december 31 2008 our goodwill totaled 2 billion with 97 percent of this amount allocated to our utility reporting units the value of the utility reporting units may be significantly impacted by rate orders and the regulatory environment 

 

we performed our annual impairment test on october 1 2008 and determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and no impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2008 the closing price of dte energy’s stock declined by approximately 11 and at december 31 2008 

was approximately 3 percent below its book value per share the market price of an individual equity security and therefore the market capitalization of an entity with publicly traded equity securities may not be representative of the fair value of the entity as a whole substantial value may arise from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over an entity an acquirer is often willing to pay more for equity securities that give it a controlling interest ie a control premium than an investor would pay for a number of equity securities representing less than a controlling interest that control premium may cause the fair value of the entity to exceed its market capitalization in assessing whether the recent modest decline in the trading price of dte energy’s common stock below its book value was an indication of impairment we considered the following factors 1 the relatively short duration and modest decline in the trading price of dte energy’s common stock 2 the impact of the national and regional recession on dte energy’s future operating results and anticipated cash flows 3 the favorable results of the recently performed annual impairment test and 4 a comparison of book value to the traded market price including the impact of a control premium the implied control premium of approximately 3 percent needed to equate dte energy’s market price to its book value was below the low end of the range of control premiums observed in recent transactions as a result of this assessment we determined that the decline in market price did not represent a trigger event at december 31 2008 and an updated impairment test was not performed 

 

we will continue to monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections 

 

longlived assets 

 

we evaluate the carrying value of our longlived assets excluding goodwill when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the longlived assets are deteriorating business climate condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life the review of longlived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of longlived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a longlived asset is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the longlived asset over its fair value an impairment would require us to reduce both the longlived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment which would adversely impact our earnings see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

our power and industrial projects segment has longterm contracts with general motors corporation gm and ford motor company ford to provide onsite energy services at certain of their facilities at december 31 2008 the book value of longlived assets used in the servicing of these facilities was approximately 85 million in addition we have an equity investment of approximately 40 million in an entity which provides similar services to chrysler llc chrysler these companies are in financial distress with gm and chrysler recently receiving loans from the us government to provide them with the working capital necessary to continue to operate in the short term we consider the recent announcements by these companies as an indication of possible impairment due to a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of our longlived assets as described in sfas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” and have performed an impairment test on these assets based on our current undiscounted cash flow projections we have determined that we do not have an impairment as of december 31 2008 we have also determined that we do not have an other than temporary decline in our chryslerrelated equity investment as described in apb 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” as the circumstances surrounding the longterm viability of these entities are dynamic and uncertain we continue to monitor developments as they occur and will update our impairment analyses accordingly 

pension and postretirement costs 

 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the company the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors including numerous assumptions and accounting elections when determining the various assumptions that are required we consider historical information as well as future expectations the benefit costs are affected by among other things the actual rate of return on plan assets the longterm expected return on plan assets the discount rate applied to benefit obligations the incidence of mortality the expected remaining service period of plan participants level of compensation and rate of compensation increases employee age length of service the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments some of which are capitalized 

 

we had pension costs for pension plans of 24 million in 2008 76 million in 2007 and 134 million in 2006 postretirement benefits costs for all plans were 142 million in 2008 188 million in 2007 and 197 million in 2006 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2008 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 875 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity bond and other markets our 2009 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 55 in equity markets 20 in fixed income markets and 25 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe that 875 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2009 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

 

we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the marketrelated value mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas 87 and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” allow the mrv of plan assets to be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years for our pension plans we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded volatile financial markets contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net losses as of december 31 2008 we had 11 billion of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets for our postretirement benefit plans we use fair value when determining the mrv of postretirement benefit plan assets therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans 

 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis increased from 65 at december 31 2007 to 69 at december 31 2008 due to the combination of recent company contributions losses on plan assets due to negative financial market performance and higher discount rates we estimate that our 2009 total pension costs will approximate 57 million compared to 24 million in 2008 and our 2009 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 208 million compared to 142 million in 2008 future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design the pension cost tracking mechanism implemented in november 2004 that provided for recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below amounts reflected in detroit edison’s base rates at the request of detroit edison was not reauthorized by the mpsc in its rate order effective january 1 2009 in april 2005 

the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of michcon’s negative pension expense michcon will record a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2008 pension costs by approximately 39 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2008 pension costs by approximately 37 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by onepercentagepoint would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2008 by approximately 26 million 

 

at december 31 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 and recognized the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement plans the impact of the adoption of sfas no 158 was an increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities of approximately 13 billion in 2006 we requested and received agreement from the mpsc to record the additional liability amounts for the detroit edison and michcon benefit plans on the statement of financial position as a regulatory asset as a result regulatory assets were increased by approximately 12 billion the remainder of the increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in 2008 as required by sfas 158 we changed the measurement date of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from november 30 to december 31 as a result we recognized adjustments of 17 million 9 million aftertax and 4 million to retained earnings and regulatory liabilities respectively which represents approximately one month of pension and other postretirement benefit cost for the period from december 1 2007 to december 31 2008 

 

the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected in a negative manner by the financial markets the value of our plan assets was 38 billion at november 30 2007 and 28 billion at december 31 2008 at december 31 2008 our pension plans were underfunded by 877 million and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 14 billion reflected in noncurrent assets current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities respectively the decline relative to 2007 funding levels results from negative investment performance returns in 2008 

 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without substantial returns in the financial markets we made contributions to our pension plans of 100 million and 150 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively also we contributed 50 million to our pension plans in january 2009 at the discretion of management consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 and depending upon financial market conditions we anticipate making up to a 250 million contribution to our pension plans in 2009 and up to 11 billion over the next five years we made postretirement benefit plan contributions of 116 million and 76 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively in january 2009 we contributed 40 million to our postretirement benefit plans we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in detroit edison’s and michcon’s base rates as a result we expect to make up to a 130 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2009 and subject to mpsc funding requirements up to 750 million over the next five years 

 

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act was signed into law this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law the effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced costs by 14 million in 2008 16 million in 2007 and 17 million in 2006 

 

see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

legal reserves 

 

we are involved in various legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us 

insured and uninsured risks 

 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure the maximum selfinsured retention for various risks is as follows property damage  10 million general liability — 7 million workers’ compensation — 9 million and auto liability — 7 million we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported ibnr liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate as of december 31 2008 this ibnr liability was approximately 39 million 

 

accounting for tax obligations 

 

we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach a morelikelythannot recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits no benefit will be recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold we also have nonincome tax obligations related to property sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters that are outside the scope of fin 48 and accounted for under sfas no 5 and fasb statement of financial accounting concepts no 6 

 

accounting for tax obligations requires judgments including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with fin 48 sfas no 5 sfas no 109 and fasb statement of financial accounting concepts no 6 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

environmental matters 

 

environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which dte or its subsidiaries including detroit edison and michcon are responsible the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties the time of the remediation work changes in technology regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities these matters if resolved in a manner different from the estimates could have a material effect on our results of operation and financial position to the extent the costs are not recovered through the base rates set for our utilities see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

effective january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 the cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of sfas no 157 represented a 4 million increase to the january 1 2008 balance of retained earnings as permitted by fasb staff position fas 1572 we have deferred the effective date of sfas no 157 as it pertains to nonfinancial assets and liabilities to january 1 2009 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

derivative accounting 

 

the accounting standards for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex moreover significant judgment is required to determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently if a contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument it is recorded in the financial statements as derivative assets or liabilities at the fair value of the contract the recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted at each reporting date in the consolidated statements of operations to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract a practice known as marktomarket mtm accounting changes in the fair value of a designated derivative that is highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes until the hedged item affects income these amounts are subsequently reclassified into earnings as a component of the value of the forecasted transaction in the same period as the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the fair value changes is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations immediately 

 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fair value of derivative contracts are determined from a combination of quoted market prices published indexes and mathematical valuation models where possible we derive the pricing for our contracts from active quotes or external resources actively quoted indexes include exchangetraded positions such as the new york mercantile exchange and the intercontinental exchange and overthecounter positions for which broker quotes are available for periods or locations in which external market data is not readily observable we estimate value using mathematical valuation models valuation models require various inputs including forward prices volatility interest rates and exercise periods for those inputs which are not observable we use modelbased extrapolation proxy techniques or historical analysis to derive the required valuation inputs we periodically update our policy and valuation methodologies for changes in market liquidity and other assumptions which may impact the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts liquidity and transparency in energy markets where fair value is evidenced by market quotes current market transactions or other observable market information may require us to record gains or losses at inception of new derivative contracts our credit risk and the credit risk of our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves the impact of which is immaterial for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power gas certain coal and oil forwards futures options and swaps and foreign currency contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives include proprietary gas inventory certain gas storage and transportation arrangements and gas and oil reserves 

 

we manage our mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of our contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract accordingly we record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our contracts in separate components based on the commodity eg electricity or gas the product eg electricity for delivery during peak or offpeak hours the delivery location eg by region the risk profile eg forward or option and the delivery period eg by month and year 

the subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating characteristics and key risks 

 

  

as a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles the tables below do not include the expected earnings impacts of certain nonderivative gas storage transportation and power contracts consequently gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods resulting in volatility in dte energy’s reported periodbyperiod earnings however the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse at the time of physical delivery andor settlement 

 

the following tables provide details on changes in our mtm net asset or liability position during 2008 

 

 

 

a substantial portion of the company’s price risk related to its antrim shale gas exploration and production business was mitigated by financial contracts that hedged our price risk exposure through 2013 the contracts were retained when the antrim business was sold and offsetting financial contracts were put into place to effectively settle these positions the contracts will require payments through 2013 these contracts represent a significant portion of the above net marktomarket liability 

the following table provides a current and noncurrent analysis of derivative assets and liabilities as reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31 2008 amounts that relate to contracts that become due within twelve months are classified as current and all remaining amounts are classified as noncurrent

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market price risk 

 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

 

the electric and gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations further changes in the price of electricity can impact the level of exposure of customer choice programs and uncollectible expenses at the electric utility in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost gas storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the gas utility however the company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in regulatory raterecovery mechanisms regulatory raterecovery occurs in the form of pscr and gcr mechanisms see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and tracking mechanisms to mitigate some losses from customer migration due to electric customer choice programs and uncollectible accounts receivable at michcon the company is exposed to shortterm cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery 

 

our power and industrial projects business segment is subject to crude oil electricity natural gas coal and coalbased product price risk and other risks associated with the weakened us economy including constricted capital and credit markets to the extent that commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of longterm contracts we manage this exposure using forward energy capacity and futures contracts 

our unconventional gas production business segment has exposure to natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil price fluctuations these commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations to manage this exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts 

 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas crude oil heating oil and foreign currency price fluctuations these risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage options and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

 

our gas midstream business segment has limited exposure to natural gas price fluctuations the gas midstream business unit manages its exposure through the sale of longterm storage and transportation contracts 

 

credit risk 

 

bankruptcies 

 

we purchase and sell electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail and other industries certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code we regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss we believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on our financial statements 

 

our utilities and certain nonutility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive industry including gm ford and chrysler and many of their vendors and suppliers gm and chrysler have recently received loans from the us government to provide them with the working capital necessary to continue to operate in the short term in february 2009 gm and chrysler submitted viability plans to the us government indicating that additional loans were necessary to continue operations in the short term further plant closures bankruptcies or a federal government mandated restructuring program could have a significant impact on our results particularly in our electric utility and power and industrial projects segments as the circumstances surrounding the viability of these entities are dynamic and uncertain we continue to monitor developments as they occur 

 

other 

 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

 

trading activities 

 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internally 

generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

interest rate risk 

 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2008 we had a floating rate debttototal debt ratio of approximately 12 excluding securitized debt 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

we have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations we have entered into a series of currency forward contracts through january 2013 additionally we may enter into fair value currency hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans 

 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing 

forward rates at december 31 2008 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values 

 

the results of the sensitivity analysis calculations follow

electric utility 

description 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison an electric utility subject to regulation by the mpsc and ferc detroit edison is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electric energy to approximately 22 million customers in a 7600 square mile area in southeastern michigan 

our plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdeq electricity is generated from our numerous fossil plants a hydroelectric pumped storage plant and a nuclear plant and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers 

the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to four major classes of customers residential commercial industrial and wholesale principally throughout michigan 

 

 

 weather economic factors competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on detroit edison 

fuel supply and purchased power 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power we expect to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers our generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms we expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases we have six longterm and two shortterm contracts for a total purchase of approximately 35 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2007 to 2010 we also have ten contracts for the purchase of approximately 8 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2007 through 2009 all of these contracts have fixed prices we have approximately 90 of our 2007 expected coal requirements under contract given the geographic diversity of supply we believe we can meet our expected generation requirements we lease a fleet of rail cars and have longterm transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities 

detroit edison participates in the energy market through miso we offer our generation in the market on a dayahead and realtime basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load we are a net purchaser of power which supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles 

properties 

detroit edison owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the state of michigan substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

generating plants owned and in service as of december 31 2006 are as follows 

 

 

 detroit edison owns and operates 675 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33075000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 426700 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 25883000 kva 

circuit miles of distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2006 are as follows 

 

there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between detroit edison and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc transmission and connect to neighboring energy companies 

regulation 

detroit edison’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including but not limited to the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edison’s nuclear plant operations we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

since 1996 there have been several important acts orders court rulings and legislative actions in the state of michigan that affect detroit edison’s operations in 1996 the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s electric customers access to electricity supplied by other generators and marketers in 1998 the mpsc authorized the electric customer choice program that allowed for a limited number of customers to purchase electricity from suppliers other than their local utility the local utility continues to transport the electric supply to the customers’ facilities thereby retaining distribution margins the electric customer choice program was phased in over a threeyear period with all customers having the option to choose their electric supplier by january 2002 

in 2000 the michigan legislature enacted legislation that reduced electric rates by 5 and reaffirmed january 2002 as the date for full implementation of the electric customer choice program this legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing rate increases for small business customers through 2004 and for residential customers through 2005 the legislation and an mpsc order issued in 2001 established a methodology to enable detroit edison to recover stranded costs related to its generation operations that may not otherwise be recoverable due to electric customer choice related lost sales and margins the legislation also provides for the recovery of the costs associated with the implementation of the electric customer choice program the mpsc has determined that these costs will be treated as regulatory assets additionally the legislation provides for recovery of costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes laws and other governmental actions including the clean air act 

in 2004 the mpsc issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases totaling 374 million and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for electric customer choice customers the increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap the interim order affirmed the resumption of the pscr mechanism for both capped and uncapped customers which reduced pscr revenues the mpsc also authorized the recovery of approximately 385 million in regulatory assets including stranded costs as part of the final order detroit edison was ordered to file an application to restructure its electric rates 

in february 2005 detroit edison filed a rate restructuring proposal with the mpsc to restructure its electric rates and begin phasing out subsidies within the current pricing structure in december 2005 the mpsc issued an order that provided for initial steps to improve the current competitive imbalance in michigan’s electric customer choice program the december 2005 order establishes costbased power supply rates for detroit edison’s full service customers electric customer choice participants will pay costbased distribution rates while detroit edison’s full service commercial and industrial customers will pay costbased distribution rates that reflect the cost of the residential rate subsidy residential customers continue to pay a subsidized below cost rate for distribution service these revenue neutral revised rates were effective february 1 2006 detroit edison was also ordered to file a general rate case no later than july 1 2007 based on 2006 actual results 

in march 2006 the mpsc issued an order directing detroit edison to show cause by june 1 2006 why its retail electric rates should not be reduced in 2007 the mpsc cited certain changes that had occurred since the november 2004 order in detroit edison’s last general rate case or were expected to occur these changes included declines in electric customer choice program participation expiration of the 

residential rate caps and projected reductions in detroit edison operating costs the show cause filing was to reflect sales costs and financial conditions that were expected to occur by 2007 on june 1 2006 detroit edison filed its response explaining why its electric rates should not be reduced in 2007 detroit edison indicated that it will have a revenue deficiency of approximately 45 million beginning in 2007 due to significant capital investments over the next several years for infrastructure improvements to enhance electric service reliability and for mandated environmental expenditures the impacts of these investments will be partially offset by efficiency and costsavings measures that have been initiated therefore detroit edison requested that the show cause proceeding allow for rate increase adjustments based on the combined effects of investment expenditures and costsavings programs the mpsc denied this request and indicated that a full review of rates will be made in detroit edison’s next general rate case which is due to be filed by july 1 2007 the mpsc issued an order approving a settlement agreement in this proceeding on august 31 2006 the order provided for an annualized rate reduction of 53 million for 2006 effective september 5 2006 beginning january 1 2007 and continuing until the later of march 31 2008 or 12 months from the filing date of detroit edison’s next main case rates will be reduced by an additional 26 million for a total reduction of 79 million the revenue reduction is net of the recovery of the amortization of the costs associated with the implementation of the performance excellence process a company wide review of our operations the settlement agreement provides for some level of realignment of the existing rate structure by allocating a larger percentage share of the rate reduction to the commercial and industrial customer classes than to the residential customer classes as part of the settlement agreement a choice incentive mechanism cim was established with a base level of electric choice sales set at 3400 gwh 

in accordance with the mpsc’s directive in detroit edison’s november 2004 rate order in march 2005 detroit edison filed a joint application and testimony in its 2004 pscr reconciliation case and its 2004 net stranded cost recovery case in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order recognizing 19 million of 2004 net stranded costs that required detroit edison to write off 112 million of 2004 net stranded costs the mpsc order resulted in a 39 million reduction in the 2004 pscr overcollection by allowing detroit edison to retain the benefit of third party wholesale sales required to support the electric customer choice program and to offset the recognition of the 19 million of 2004 stranded costs the mpsc order also resulted in reductions to accrued interest on the 2004 and 2005 pscr amounts of 15 million the mpsc directed detroit edison to include the remaining 2004 pscr overcollection amount and related interest in the 2005 pscr reconciliation which is in an undercollected position the order resulted in a reduction of pretax income of approximately 58 million 

see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

energy assistance programs 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to detroit edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses detroit edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

strategy and competition 

we strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast michigan we can accomplish this goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable low cost supplier of electricity to control expenses we optimize our fuel blends thereby taking maximum advantage of low cost environmentally friendly lowsulfur western coals to ensure generation reliability we continue to invest in our generating plants which will improve both plant availability and operating efficiencies we also are making capital investments in areas that have a positive impact on reliability and environmental compliance with the goal of high customer satisfaction 

our distribution operations focus on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service we seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” section that follows 

effective january 2002 the electric customer choice program expanded in michigan so that all of the company’s electric customers can choose to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers of generation services detroit edison lost 6 of retail sales in 2006 12 in 2005 and 18 of such sales in 2004 as a result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose mpscauthorized full service rates exceed their cost of service customers who elect to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers by participating in the electric customer choice program have an unfavorable effect on our financial performance the effect of lost sales due to the electric customer choice program has reduced our need for purchased power and when market conditions are favorable we sell power into the wholesale market in order to lower costs to full service customers 

detroit edison acquires transmission services from itc transmission by ferc order rates charged by itc transmission to detroit edison were frozen through december 2004 thereafter rates became subject to normal ferc regulation with the mpsc’s november 2004 final rate order transmission costs are recoverable through detroit edison’s pscr mechanism 

we are currently involved in a contract dispute with bnsf railway company that has been referred to arbitration under this contract bnsf transports western coal east for detroit edison and the coal transportation and marketing business we have filed a breach of contract claim against bnsf for the failure to provide certain services that we believe are required by the contract the arbitration hearing is scheduled for mid2007 while we believe we will prevail on the merits in this matter a negative decision with respect to the significant issues being heard in the arbitration could have an adverse effect on our business 

competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term 

gas utility 

description 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens natural gas utilities subject to regulation by the mpsc michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million residential commercial and industrial customers in the state of michigan michcon also has subsidiaries involved in the gathering and transmission of natural gas in northern michigan michcon operates one of the largest natural gas distribution and transmission systems in the united states citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of service gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation and gas storage 

 

 

our gas sales end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes revenues and net income are impacted by weather given the seasonal nature of our business revenues and net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year by the end of the first quarter the heating season is largely over and we typically realize substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter 

our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our gas utility segment 

natural gas supply 

our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily sendout capacity of 28 bcf with approximately 71 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2006 peakuse requirements are met through utilization of our storage facilities pipeline transportation capacity and purchased gas supplies because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline transportation and storage capacity we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements we believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future 

we purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts supplier producing region quantity and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas gulf coast midcontinent canada and michigan under agreements 

that vary in both pricing and terms gas supply pricing is generally tied to nymex and published price indices to approximate current market prices 

properties 

we own distribution transmission and storage properties that are located in the state of michigan our distribution system includes approximately 19000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1188000 service lines and approximately 1321000 active meters we own approximately 2600 miles of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas 

we own properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 124 bcf these facilities are important in providing reliable and costeffective service to our customers in addition we sell storage services to third parties most of the company’s distribution and transmission property are located on property owned by others and used by the company through easements permits or licenses substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage 

we are directly connected to interstate pipelines providing access to most of the major natural gas producing regions in the gulf coast midcontinent and canadian regions 

the company’s primary longterm transportation contracts are as follows 

 

we own 840 miles of transportation and gathering pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of michigan we lease a portion of our pipeline system to the vector pipeline partnership an affiliate through a capital lease arrangement see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulation 

we are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and other operatingrelated matters we are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health 

in the late 1990s the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s natural gas customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower gas costs resulting from competition in 1999 the mpsc approved a comprehensive experimental threeyear gas customer choice program that allowed an increasing number of customers to purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility in december 2001 the mpsc issued an order that continued the gas customer choice program on a permanent and expanding basis the permanent gas customer choice program was phased in over a threeyear period with all customers having the option to choose their gas supplier by april 2004 since michcon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on michcon’s earnings 

in april 2005 the mpsc issued a final rate order which increased michcon’s base rates by 61 million annually effective april 29 2005 

see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

energy assistance program 

energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses michcon’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive we work continuously with the state of michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 

strategy and competition 

our strategy is to be a preferred provider of natural gas in michigan as a result of more efficient furnaces and appliances and customer conservation due to high natural gas prices we expect future sales volumes to remain at current levels or slightly decline we continue to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies 

competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas providers as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources the primary focus of competition for end user transportation is cost and reliability some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal electricity oil and steam if these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source they would not have a need for our enduser transportation service in addition some of these customers could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline we compete against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service supported by our storage capacity 

our extensive transmission pipeline system has enabled us to market 500 to 600 bcf annually for intermediate transportation services for michigan gas producers marketers distribution companies and other pipeline companies we operate in a central geographic location with connections to major midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the midwest eastern united states and eastern canada 

nonutility operations

strategy and competition 

our coal transportation and marketing business is one of the leading north american coal marketers we have a reputation as being an efficient manager of transportation assets trends such as railroad and mining consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing new mines by many mining firms could have an impact on how we compete in the future we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers we will seek to build our capacity to transport greater amounts of western coal and to expand into coal terminals we are currently involved in a contract dispute with bnsf railway company that has been referred to arbitration under this contract bnsf transports western coal east for detroit edison and the coal transportation and marketing business we have filed a breach of contract claim against bnsf for the failure to provide certain services that we believe are required by the contract the arbitration hearing is scheduled for mid2007 while we believe we will prevail on the merits in this matter a negative decision with respect to the significant issues being heard in the arbitration could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow the coal transportation and marketing business as currently contemplated 

the pipelines processing and storage business focuses on asset development opportunities in the midwesttonortheast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand we expect much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the us to occur within the midatlantic and new england regions these regions currently lack the pipeline and gas storage infrastructure necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet growing demand vector is an interstate pipeline that is filling a large portion of that need and is complemented by our michigan storage facilities vector received ferc approval in october 2006 for a 200 mmcf per day expansion of longhaul capacity scheduled to be in service by november 2007 in april 2006 the washington 10 storage facility expanded working capacity from 514 to 66 bcf in october 2006 we purchased the lessor interest in the 66 bcf washington 10 gas storage field prior to the purchase we leased the storage rights another opportunity is millennium pipeline in new york in which we have a 2625 interest in december 2006 millennium pipeline received ferc approval for construction and operation and is expected to be in service in late 2008 the millennium pipeline will be able to transport up to 525 mmcf per day the gas supply for millennium could be sourced from michigan storage facilities or from vector pipeline for consumption in the northeast us 

unconventional gas production 

description 

our unconventional gas production business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production primarily within the antrim shale in the northern lower peninsula of michigan and the barnett shale in north texas we are an experienced operator in the antrim shale where we manage one of the industry’s largest inventories of proved gas shale reserves we continue to develop properties in both areas as we explore monetization alternatives 

during 2006 we invested 186 million acquiring testing developing and producing our antrim and barnett shale acreage in 2006 we added proved reserves of 219 bcfe in both the antrim and barnett shales resulting in year end total proved reserves of 616 bcfe the barnett and antrim shale wells yielded 41 bcfe and 215 bcfe of production respectively in 2006 for a total of 256 bcfe barnett shale leasehold acres increased to 89808 gross acres 80530 net of interest of others after reduction by opportunistic sales of 11193 acres we drilled a total of 206 development wells 1652 net of interest of others including 64 wells 548 net of interest of others in the barnett shale acreage with a success rate of 100 in 2006 included were 4 test wells 32 net of interest of others in unproved areas of the southern portion of our barnett shale acreage holdings production commenced in the bosque and hill counties of texas in 2006 testing of barnett’s southern acreage is ongoing and will continue in 2007 

properties 

unconventional gas production owns interests in the following producing wells and acreage as of december 31 

 

 

 strategy and competition 

we manage and operate our antrim and barnett shale gas properties to maximize returns on investment and increase earnings with the overriding goal of optimizing the cost of producing reserves and adding additional proved reserves a longterm fixed price obligation that fixed the price of gas sold at 333 for 18 bcf of antrim shale production expired in 2006 this creates pricing opportunities and we have and will continue to remarket antrim shale gas production at current higher market rates 

additional longterm fixed price obligation data for the next five years follows 

 

current natural gas prices and successes within the barnett shale are resulting in more capital being invested into the region this competition for opportunities goods and services increases costs however our experience in the antrim shale and our experienced barnett shale personnel provide an advantage in addressing potential cost increases 

in 2007 we expect to drill 130 to 145 wells in the antrim shale and 50 to 55 wells in the barnett shale combined investment for both areas is expected to be approximately 150 million to 170 million during 2007 successful testing on unproved acreage may yield additional significant investment opportunities 

we are exploring the sale of a portion of our unconventional gas production assets which will allow us to monetize value from our more mature holdings while retaining the ability to benefit from the upside of our earlier stage holdings

synthetic fuel 

description 

synfuel plants chemically change coal and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code the synthetic fuel process involves chemically modifying and binding particles of coal to produce a fuel that is used for power generation and coke production production tax credits are provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and are available through december 31 2007 the synthetic fuel plants generate operating losses which we expect to be offset by production tax credits the value of a production tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor and published annually by the internal revenue service irs and is reduced or eliminated if the reference price of a barrel of oil exceeds certain thresholds 

we are the operator of nine synthetic fuel production facilities throughout the united states on may 12 2006 we idled production at all nine of the synthetic fuel facilities the decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the level and volatility of oil prices at that time during the idle period we took various steps to reduce our oil price exposure including renegotiation of a significant number of commercial agreements beginning september 5 2006 through october 4 2006 we resumed production 

at each of the nine synfuel facilities due to these amended commercial agreements and declines in the level of oil prices 

since 2002 we have sold interests in all nine of our synfuel plants ranging from a 4999 share in each or approximately 91 of our total production capacity we consolidate these projects due to our controlling influence and continuing involvement 

 

properties 

the following are our synthetic fuels projects 

 

strategy and competition 

due to our hedging strategy implemented in 2006 we expect to continue to operate the synfuel plants through december 31 2007 when synfuelrelated production tax credits expire 

corporate  other 

description 

corporate  other includes various corporate staff functions because these functions support the entire company their costs are allocated to the various segments based on services utilized therefore the effect of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year additionally corporate  other holds certain nonutility debt assets held for sale and investments in energyrelated companies and funds 

strategy and competition 

our energyrelated investment strategy is to create a profitable portfolio by investing in companies or funds that facilitate the creation of new businesses expand growth opportunities for existing businesses or enable performance improvements in our existing businesses 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers the following table summarizes our estimated significant future environmental expenditures 

 

air  detroit edison is subject to epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in march 2005 epa issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions the cost to address environmental air issues is estimated through 2018 

water – in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of studies to be conducted over the next one to two years detroit edison may be required to perform some mitigation activities including the possible installation of additional control technologies to reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures however a recent court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation resulting in a delay in complying with the regulation 

mgp sites  prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil the facilities which produced gas for heating and other uses have been designated as mgp sites gas utility owns or previously owned fifteen such former mgp sites in addition to the mgp sites the company is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites as a result of these determinations we have recorded liabilities related to these sites cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 

detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including two mgp sites the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations the findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years in addition detroit edison will be making capital improvements to the ash landfill in 2007 

nonutility – our nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we are in the process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facility in michigan we expect the project to be completed within one year our nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 

greater details on environmental issues are provided in the following notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

the following table shows our employees as of december 31 2006 

 

there are several bargaining units for our represented employees approximately 3245 of our represented employees are under contracts that expire in june 2007 and 970 employees are under contracts that expire in october 2007 the contracts of the remaining represented employees expire at various dates in 2008 and 2009

we and our directors and officers in their capacities as such are insured against liability for alleged wrongful acts to the extent defined under eight insurance policies providing aggregate coverage in the amount of 185 million 

item 1a company risk factors 

there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energy’s utility and nonutility businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance 

our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels from alternative sources we have generated production tax credits from the synfuel coke battery landfill gas recovery and gas production operations we have received favorable private letter rulings on all of the synfuel facilities all production tax credits taken after 2003 are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows the value of future credits generated may be affected by potential legislation moreover the opportunity to earn additional production tax credits related to the generation of synfuels and recovery of landfill gas will expire at the end of 2007 the combination of irs audits of production tax credits supply and demand for investment in credit producing activities and potential legislation could have an impact on our earnings and cash flows we have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities 

this incentive provided by production tax credits is not deemed necessary if the price of oil increases and provides significant market incentives for the production of these fuels as such the tax credit in a given year is reduced if the reference price of oil within that year exceeds a threshold price the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil we project the yearly average wellhead price per barrel of oil for the year to be approximately 6 lower than the nymex price for light sweet crude oil the threshold price at which the credit begins to 

be reduced was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation for 2006 we estimate the threshold price at which the tax credit would begin to be reduced is 55 per barrel and would be completely phased out if the reference price reached 69 per barrel as of december 31 2006 the average nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil was approximately 66 for 2006 equating to an estimated reference price of 60 which we estimate to be within the phaseout range to mitigate the effect of a potential phase out and minimize operating losses on may 12 2006 we idled production at all nine of the synfuel facilities the decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the level and volatility of oil prices at that time beginning september 5 2006 through october 4 2006 we resumed production at each of the nine synfuel facilities due to declines in the level of oil prices 

our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change we cannot assure that our estimates of our antrim and barnett gas reserves are accurate estimates of proved gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent engineers there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves including factors beyond our control and that of our engineers reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves or of cash flows attributable to such reserves is a function of the available data assumptions regarding expenditures for future development and exploration activities and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment additionally reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history development and exploration activities and prices of gas actual future production revenue taxes development expenditures operating expenses underlying information quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information we used in addition different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 

michigan’s electric customer choice program is negatively impacting our financial performance  the electric customer choice program as originally contemplated in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers while alternative electric suppliers charge marketbased rates in addition such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers recent mpsc rate orders have removed some of the pricing disparity recent higher wholesale electric prices have also resulted in some former electric customer choice customers migrating back to detroit edison for electric generation service even with the electric customer choicerelated rate relief received in detroit edison’s 2004 and 2005 orders there continues to be considerable financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program electric customer choice migration is sensitive to market price and bundled electric service price increases the hybrid market in michigan also causes uncertainity as it relates to investment in new generating capacity 

weather significantly affects operations  deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow damage due to ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage our infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be recoverable through the regulatory process 

we are subject to rate regulation  electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization we may be impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses 

our nonutility operations may not perform to our expectations we rely on our nonutility operations for a significant portion of our earnings if our current and contemplated nonutility investments do not perform at expected levels we could experience diminished earnings potential and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value 

we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries cash flows from our utility and nonutility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted 

adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance a downgrade in our credit rating could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs in addition a reduction in credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various trading contracts which would impact our liquidity 

our ability to access capital markets at attractive interest rates is important our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses heightened concerns about the energy industry the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our financial performance 

regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us our businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve should national or regional economic conditions decline reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will result in decreased earnings and cash flow economic conditions in our service territory also impact our collections of accounts receivable and financial results 

environmental laws and liability may be costly we are subject to numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address the climate change issue the regulatory environment is subject to significant change therefore we cannot predict how future issues may impact the company 

additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties 

since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters 

operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks these risks include among others plant security environmental regulation and remediation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility while we maintain insurance for various nuclearrelated risks there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant which may affect our financial performance 

the supply and price of fuel and other commodities may impact our financial results we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity price fluctuations and fuel supply disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate electricity our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers we have hedging strategies in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations the price of natural gas also impacts the market for our nonutility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers 

a work interruption may adversely affect us unions represent approximately 5400 of our employees a union choosing to strike as a negotiating tactic would have an impact on our business we are unable to predict the effects a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance 

unplanned power plant outages may be costly unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations as a result of unforeseen maintenance we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs 

michigan tax reform may be costly  the state of michigan is experiencing a revenue shortfall we are a significant taxpayer in the state of michigan the legislature is expected to change the tax laws in 2007 and we could face increased taxes 

we may not be fully covered by insurance while we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism war or a combination of significant unforeseen events could impact our operations and economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance 

terrorism could affect our business  damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets by terrorism would impact our operations we have increased security as a result of past events and further security increases are possible 

our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk  events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole in certain situations we may also be required to post collateral to support trading operations we have established risk policies to manage the business 

failure to successfully implement new processes and information systems could interrupt our operations our businesses depend on numerous information systems for operations and financial information and billings we are in the midst of a multiyear companywide initiative to improve existing processes and implement new core information systems we launched the first phase of our enterprise business systems project in 2005 additional phases of implementation are planned for 2007 failure to successfully implement new processes and new core information systems could interrupt our operations 

benefits of the performance excellence process to the company could be less than the company has projected in 2005 we initiated a companywide review of our operations called the performance excellence process with the overarching goal to become more competitive by reducing costs eliminating waste and optimizing business processes while improving customer service actual results achieved through this process could be less than the company’s expectations 

the inability to consummate any strategic transactions for our nonutility operations could affect our expected cash flows as part of a strategic review of our nonutility operations we are considering various actions including the sale restructuring or recapitalization of various nonutility businesses if we are not able to consummate any strategic transactions on favorable terms or timing our expected cash flows could be lower than anticipated

item 6 selected financial data 

the following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the accompanying management’s discussion and analysis and notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2006 revenues in excess of 9 billion and approximately 24 billion in assets we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout southeastern michigan we operate five energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

the decrease in 2006 net income is primarily due to the temporary idling of synfuel plants along with the associated impairments and reserves and impairments within our power and industrial projects segment this decrease was partially offset by higher earnings at our electric utility detroit edison and energy trading segment marktomarket losses in 2005 which did not recur in 2006 

the items discussed below influenced our current financial performance and may affect future results 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utility operations 

weather  earnings from our utility operations are seasonal and very sensitive to weather electric utility earnings are primarily dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utility’s results are primarily dependent on cold winter weather during 2006 we experienced milder than normal weather conditions 

additionally we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages restoration and other costs associated with stormrelated power outages lowered pretax earnings by 46 million in 2006 82 million in 2005 and 48 million in 2004 

receivables  both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables especially within our gas utility operations the increase is attributable to economic conditions higher natural gas prices and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers 

we have taken aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables including increased customer disconnections contracting with collection agencies and working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers in 2006 we sold previously writtenoff accounts of 43 million resulting in a gain and net proceeds of 19 million the gain was recorded as a recovery through bad debt expense which is included within operation and maintenance expense 

as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts expense for the two utilities increased to 123 million in 2006 from 98 million in 2005 and from 105 million in 2004 

the april 2005 mpsc gas rate order provided for an uncollectible trueup mechanism for michcon we filed the 2005 annual reconciliation comparing our actual uncollectible expense to our designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million on an annual basis the mpsc approved the 2005 annual reconciliation on december 21 2006 allowing michcon to surcharge the 11 million excess beginning in january 2007 

we expect to file the 2006 annual reconciliation with the mpsc no later than march 31 2007 comparing our actual 2006 uncollectible expense to our designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million ninety percent of the difference for the year will be requested to be surcharged as part of the annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc we have accrued 33 million under the 2006 uncollectible trueup mechanism 

regulatory activity  in accordance with the mpsc’s directive in detroit edison’s november 2004 rate order in march 2005 detroit edison filed a joint application and testimony in its 2004 pscr reconciliation case and its 2004 net stranded cost recovery case in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order recognizing 19 million of 2004 net stranded costs that required detroit edison to write off 112 million of 2004 net stranded costs the mpsc order resulted in a 39 million reduction in the 2004 pscr overcollection by allowing detroit edison to retain the benefit of third party wholesale sales 

required to support the electric customer choice program and to offset the recognition of the 19 million of 2004 stranded costs the mpsc order also resulted in reductions in accrued interest on the 2004 and 2005 pscr amounts of 15 million the mpsc directed detroit edison to include the remaining 2004 pscr overcollection amount and related interest in the 2005 pscr reconciliation which is in an undercollected position the order resulted in a reduction of pretax income of approximately 58 million 

the following graph depicts the total electric customer choice volumes for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier 

electric customer choice volumes in mwh 

in march 2006 the mpsc issued an order directing detroit edison to show cause by june 1 2006 why its retail electric rates should not be reduced in 2007 the mpsc issued an order approving the settlement agreement in this proceeding on august 31 2006 the order provided for an annualized rate reduction of 53 million for 2006 effective september 5 2006 beginning january 1 2007 and continuing until the later of march 31 2008 or 12 months from the filing date of detroit edison’s next main rate case rates will be reduced by an additional 26 million for a total reduction of 79 million detroit edison experienced a rate reduction of approximately 13 million in 2006 as a result of this order the revenue reduction is net of the recovery of the amortization of the costs associated with the implementation of the performance excellence process the settlement agreement provides for some level of realignment of the existing rate structure by allocating a larger percentage share of the rate reduction to the commercial and industrial customer classes than to the residential customer classes 

coal supply — our generating fleet produces approximately 70 of its electricity from coal increasing coal demand from domestic and international markets has resulted in significant price increases in addition difficulty in recruiting workers obtaining environmental permits and finding economically recoverable amounts of new coal has resulted in decreasing coal output from the central appalachian region furthermore as a result of environmental regulation and declining eastern coal stocks demand for cleaner burning western coal has increased this increased demand for western coal has also resulted in a corresponding demand for western rail shipping straining railroad capacity resulting in longer lead times for western coal shipments 

nuclear fuel  we operate one nuclear facility that undergoes a periodic refueling outage approximately every eighteen months uranium prices have been rising due to supply concerns in the future there may be additional nuclear facilities constructed in the industry that may place additional pressure on uranium supplies and prices we have a contract with the us department of energy doe for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from fermi 2 we are obligated to pay the doe a fee of 1 mill per kwh of fermi 2 electricity generated and sold the fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense delays 

have occurred in the doe’s program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository until the doe is able to fulfill its obligation under the contract we are responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage we are currently expanding the fermi 2 spent fuel pool capacity to meet our storage requirements through 2009 we are a party in the litigation against the doe for both past and future costs associated with the doe’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the federal nuclear waste policy act of 1982 

nonutility operations 

we have made significant investments in nonutility assetintensive businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets skill and expertise specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile a number of factors have impacted our nonutility businesses including the effect of oil prices on the synthetic fuel business losses from certain power generation assets losses from our waste coal recovery and landfill gas recovery businesses and earnings volatility in our energy trading business as part of a strategic review of our nonutility operations we are considering various actions including the sale restructuring or recapitalization of various nonutility businesses which we expect may generate over 800 million in cash proceeds in 2007 we plan to continue to invest in focused areas that have the strongest opportunities 

the primary source of recent investment capital has been cash flow from the synfuel business we have hedged a portion the risk of an oil pricerelated phaseout of production tax credits in the synfuel business we now anticipate approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments tax credit carryforward utilization in part could be extended past 2009 if taxable income is reduced from current forecasts 

coal and gas midstream 

we are continuing to build our capacity to transport greater amounts of western coal and to expand into coal terminals to allow for increased coal storage and blending we are currently involved in a contract dispute with bnsf railway company that has been referred to arbitration under this contract bnsf transports western coal east for detroit edison and the coal transportation and marketing business we have filed a breach of contract claim against bnsf for the failure to provide certain services that we believe are required by the contract the arbitration hearing is scheduled for mid2007 while we believe we will prevail on the merits in this matter a negative decision with respect to the significant issues being heard in the arbitration could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow the coal transportation and marketing business as currently contemplated 

pipelines processing and storage is continuing its steady growth plan of expansion of storage capacity in michigan and expanding and building new pipeline capacity to serve markets in the midwest and northeast united states 

unconventional gas production 

current natural gas prices provide attractive opportunities for our unconventional gas production business segment we are an experienced operator with more than 15 years of experience in the antrim shale in northern michigan and we continue to expand our operations in the barnett shale basin in north texas where recent leasehold acquisitions have increased our total leasehold acreage to 89808 acres 80530 net of interest of others after reduction by opportunistic sales of 11193 acres 

we are exploring the sale of a portion of our unconventional gas production assets which will allow us to monetize value from our more mature holdings while retaining the ability to benefit from the upside of our earlier stage holdings 

antrim shale — we intend to develop existing acreage using the latest vertical and horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation techniques our longterm fixedprice obligations for production of antrim continue to expire in 2007 this will create opportunities to remarket antrim production at significantly higher current market rates 

 

 

 barnett shale  we anticipate significant opportunities in our existing barnett shale acreage and expect continued extension of producing areas within the fort worth basin we are currently in the test and development phase for unproved and recently acquired barnett shale acreage 

 

 

 current natural gas prices and successes within the barnett shale are resulting in more capital being invested into the region the competition for opportunities and goods and services may result in increased operating costs however our experience in the antrim shale and our experienced barnett shale personnel provide an advantage in addressing potential cost increases we invested 186 million in 

2006 and expect to invest a combined amount of approximately 150 million to 170 million in our unconventional gas business in 2007 

as a component of our risk management strategy for our barnett shale reserves we hedged a portion of our proved developed producing reserves to secure an attractive investment return as of december 31 2006 we entered into a series of cash flow hedges for 47 bcf of anticipated gas production through 2010 at an average price of 808 per mcf 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver utilitytype services to industrial commercial and institutional customers and biomass energy projects we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries these services include pulverized coal and petroleum coke supply power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply we own and operate three gasfired peaking electric generating plants and a biomassfired electric generating plant and operate one additional gasfired power plant under contract additionally we own a gasfired peaking electric generating plant that was taken out of service in september 2006 we develop own and operate landfill gas recovery systems throughout the united states we produce coke from two coke batteries the production of coke from our coke batteries generates production tax credits assuming no phaseout 

we are exploring the combination of a sale of an equity interest in and recapitalization of some of the assets of the power and industrial projects business including the sale or restructuring of the power generation assets in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell our georgetown peaking electric generating facility the sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2007 

energy trading 

significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions most financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting periods we may incur marktomarket accounting gains or losses in one period that will reverse in subsequent periods when transactions are settled 

during 2005 our earnings were negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas in addition we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts the financial impacts of these timing differences have begun to reverse and have favorably impacted results during 2006 we are exploring strategic options for the energy trading business 

synthetic fuel 

synthetic fuel operations 

synfuel plants chemically change coal and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code production tax credits are provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and are available through december 31 2007 the synthetic fuel plants generate operating losses which we expect to be offset by production tax credits the value of a production tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor and published annually by the internal revenue service irs the value is reduced if the reference price of a barrel of oil exceeds certain thresholds 

we are the operator of nine synthetic fuel production facilities throughout the united states on may 12 2006 we idled production at all nine of the synthetic fuel facilities the decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the level and volatility of oil prices at that time during the idle period we took various steps to reduce our oil price exposure including renegotiation of a significant number of commercial agreements beginning september 5 2006 through october 4 2006 we resumed production at each of the nine synfuel facilities due to these amended commercial agreements and declines in the level of oil prices 

recognition of synfuel gains 

to optimize income and cash flow from the synfuel operations we sold interests in all nine of the facilities representing 91 of the total production capacity as of december 31 2006 proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels and the value of credits generated gains from the sale of an interest in a synfuel project are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable the probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is assured in substance we receive synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold 

the gain from the sale of synfuel facilities is generally comprised of fixed and variable components the fixed component represents note payments is not subject to refund and is recognized as a gain when earned and collectibility is assured the variable component is based on an estimate of tax credits allocated to our partners and is subject to refund based on the annual oil price phaseout the variable component is recognized as a gain only when the probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is assured additionally our partners reimburse us through the project entity for the operating losses of the synfuel facilities referred to as capital contributions in the event that the tax credit is phased out we are contractually obligated to refund an amount equal to all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners to assess the probability and estimate the amount of refund we use valuation and analysis models that calculate the probability of the reference price of oil for the year being within or exceeding the phaseout range due to changes in the agreements with certain of our synfuel partners and the exercise of existing rights by other synfuels partners a higher percentage of the payments in 2006 were variable payments as a result a larger portion of the 2006 synfuel payments are subject to refund as a result of the phaseout and therefore reduced the gain associated with the payments 

crude oil prices 

the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate by the irs of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil the value of the production tax credit in a given year is reduced if the reference price of oil over the year exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if that same reference price exceeds a phaseout price during 2006 the annual average wellhead price is projected to be approximately 6 lower than the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for light sweet crude oil the actual or estimated reference price and beginning and ending phaseout prices per barrel of oil for 2005 through 2007 are as follows 

 

the nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil for 2006 averaged approximately 66 which is approximately equal to a reference price of 60 per barrel which we estimate to be within the phaseout range the actual tax credit phaseout for 2006 will not be certain until the reference price is published by the irs in april 2007 there is a risk of at least a partial phaseout of the production tax credits in 2007 which could adversely impact our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

hedging of synfuel cash flows 

as discussed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have entered into derivative and other contracts to economically hedge a portion of our synfuel cash flow exposure to the risk of oil prices increasing the derivative contracts are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains to manage our exposure in 2007 to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could substantially reduce or eliminate synfuel sales proceeds we entered into a series of derivative contracts covering a specified number of barrels of oil the derivative contracts involve purchased and written call options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the full years’ 2007 average nymex trading prices for light sweet crude oil in relation to the strike prices of each option if the average nymex prices of oil in 2007 are less than approximately 60 per barrel the derivatives will yield no payment if the average nymex prices of oil exceed approximately 60 per barrel the derivatives will yield a payment equal to the excess of the average nymex price over these initial strike prices multiplied by the number of barrels covered up to a maximum price of approximately 76 per barrel these contracts are based on various terms to take advantage of increases in oil prices we recorded pretax marktomarket gains of 60 million during 2006 and 47 million in 2005 and a 12 million loss in 2004 the fair value changes are recorded as adjustments to the gain from selling interests in synfuel facilities and are included in the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line item in the consolidated statement of operations we paid approximately 50 million for 2006 hedges for which we received payments of approximately 156 million upon settlement of these hedges in january 2007 through december 31 2006 we paid approximately 103 million for 2007 hedges which will provide protection for a significant portion of our cash flows related to the synfuel production during 2007 as part of our synfuel related risk management strategy we continue to evaluate alternatives available to mitigate unhedged exposure to oil price volatility as our risk management position changes due to market volatility we may adjust our hedging strategy in response to changing conditions 

risks and exposures 

since there was the likelihood that the reference price for a barrel of oil would remain above the threshold at which synfuelrelated production tax credits began to phaseout we deferred gain recognition associated with variable and certain fixed note payments in 2006 until the end of the year when the probability of refund was remote and collectibility was assured we deferred all variable gains for the first three quarters of 2006 and 2005 we recognized 43 million of fixed gains and 14 million of variable gains in 2006 compared to fixed gains of 132 million and variable gains of 187 million in 2005 all or a portion of the deferred gains will be recognized when and if the gain recognition criteria is met additionally we may establish reserves for potential refunds of amounts related to partners’ capital contributions associated with operating losses allocated to their account as previously discussed in the event of a tax credit phaseout we are contractually obligated to refund to our partners all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners 

in 2006 we recorded reserves and impairments of 157 million consisting of a 79 million reserve for capital contributions related to operating losses and an impairment of 78 million for synfuelrelated fixed assets and inventory the fixed asset impairment was partially offset by 70 million included in the minority interest line on our consolidated statement of operations representing our partners’ share of the asset write down 

cash from synfuel activity is at risk of a phaseout of the production tax credits we expect approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations asset sales and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments the expected cash flow of approximately 900 million is economically hedged against the movement in oil prices in addition a goodwill writeoff of up to 4 million will likely be required in 2007 due to the production tax credit phaseout the inability to generate new production tax credits after 2007 and the resulting discontinuance of synfuel production we have fixed note receivables associated with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities a partial or full phaseout of production tax credits could adversely affect the collectibility of our receivables the cash flow impact would likely reduce our ability to execute our investment and growth strategy 

operating system and performance excellence process 

we continuously review and adjust our cost structure and seek improvements in our processes beginning in 2002 we adopted the dte energy operating system which is the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies inventory reductions and improvements in 

technology systems among other enhancements some of these cost reductions may be returned to our customers in the form of lower pscr charges and the remaining amounts may impact our profitability 

as an extension of this effort in mid2005 we initiated a companywide review of our operations called the performance excellence process the overarching goal has been and remains to become more competitive by reducing costs eliminating waste and optimizing business processes while improving customer service many of our customers are under intense economic pressure and will benefit from our efforts to keep down our costs and their rates additionally we will need significant resources in the future to invest in the infrastructure necessary to compete specifically we began a series of focused improvement initiatives within our electric and gas utilities and our corporate support function 

the process is rigorous and challenging and seeks to yield sustainable performance to our customers and shareholders we have identified the performance excellence process as critical to our longterm growth strategy detroit edison’s cta is estimated to total between 160 million and 190 million michcon’s cta is estimated to total between 55 million and 60 millionwe estimate savings of approximately 45 million in operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs were realized in 2006 in 2006 we recorded cta of approximately 134 million cta in 2006 exceeded our savings but we expect to realize sustained net cost savings beginning in 2007 

in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order approving a settlement agreement that allows detroit edison and michcon commencing in 2006 to defer the incremental cta further the order provides for detroit edison and michcon to amortize the cta deferrals over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the cta was deferred detroit edison deferred approximately 102 million of cta in 2006 as a regulatory asset and will begin amortizing deferred 2006 costs in 2007 as the recovery of these costs was provided for by the mpsc in the order approving the settlement in the show cause proceeding michcon cannot defer cta costs at this time because a recovery mechanism has not been established 

capital investment 

we anticipate significant capital investment across all of our business segments most of our capital expenditures will be concentrated within our utility segments our electric utility currently expects to invest approximately 43 billion including increased environmental requirements and reliability enhancement projects through 2011 our gas utility currently expects to invest approximately 10 billion on system expansion pipeline safety and reliability enhancement projects through the same period we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment 

in 2005 we launched the first phase of our enterprise business systems project an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems through december 2006 we have spent approximately 330 million on this project and we anticipate spending an additional 45 million to 70 million over the next year as the remaining system elements are developed and implemented 

in the future we may build a new baseload coal or nuclear electric generating plant the last baseload plant constructed within our electric utility service territory was approximately twenty years ago 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth due to the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 and the repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 there are fewer barriers to mergers and acquisitions of utility companies at the federal level however the expected industry consolidation resulting in the creation of large regional utility providers has been recently impacted by actions of regulators in certain states affected by the proposed transactions 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 

along with pursuing a leaner organization we anticipate approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet we expect to use any such cash and the potential cash from monetization of certain of our nonutility assets and operations to reduce debt and repurchase common stock and to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios to improve our current credit rating and outlook and to have any monetizations be accretive to earnings per share 

results of operations 

net income in 2006 was 433 million or 243 per diluted share compared to net income of 537 million or 305 per diluted share in 2005 and net income of 431 million or 249 per diluted share in 2004 excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes our income from continuing operations in 2006 was 437 million or 245 per diluted share compared to income of 577 million or 328 per diluted share in 2005 and income of 464 million or 268 per diluted share in 2004 the following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments’ operating performance and future outlook 

segments realigned — in the third quarter of 2006 we realigned the nonutility segment power and industrial projects business unit to separately present the synthetic fuel business the impending expiration of synfuel tax credits as of december 31 2007 combined with the sustained volatility of oil prices increased management focus on synfuels thereby requiring a separate business segment in the fourth quarter of 2006 we separated the fuel transportation and marketing segment into coal and gas midstream and energy trading corresponding to additional management focus on the results of these nonutility segments based on the following structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance 

 

 

 

 

 

 electric utility 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison which is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electric energy to approximately 22 million customers in southeastern michigan 

factors impacting income our net income increased 48 million and 127 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively these results primarily reflect higher gross margins partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses additionally 2005 results were affected by higher rates due to the november 2004 mpsc final rate order return of customers from the electric customer choice program warmer weather and lower operations and maintenance expenses partially offset by a portion of higher fuel and purchased power costs which were unrecoverable as a result of residential rate caps which expired january 1 2006 and increased depreciation and amortization expenses 

 

gross margin increased 299 million during 2006 and 189 million in 2005 the 2006 improvement was primarily due to increased rates due to the expiration of the residential rate cap on january 1 2006 and returning sales from electric customer choice partially offset by milder weather the increase in 2005 was due to higher demand resulting from warmer weather and increased rates due to the november 2004 mpsc final rate order partially offset by unrecovered power supply costs as a result of residential rate caps which expired january 1 2006 and a poor michigan economy gross margin was favorably impacted by decreased electric customer choice penetration whereby we lost 6 of retail sales to electric customer choice customers in 2006 and 12 of such sales during 2005 as retail customers migrated back to us as their electric generation provider rather than remaining with alternative suppliers pursuant to the mpsc final rate order transmission expense previously recorded in operation and maintenance expenses in 2004 is now reflected in purchased power expenses the pscr mechanism provides related revenues for the transmission expense 

the following table displays changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 operation and maintenance expense increased 28 million in 2006 and decreased 87 million in 2005 the 2006 increase was primarily due to increased distribution system maintenance of 35 million and increased plant outages of 33 million which was partially offset by 36 million of lower storm expenses pursuant to mpsc authorization detroit edison deferred approximately 102 million of cta in 2006 the comparability of 2005 to 2004 is affected by the november 2004 mpsc final rate order which required transmission and miso expenses to be included in purchased power expense with related revenues to be recorded through the pscr mechanism additionally the dte energy parent company no longer allocated mergerrelated interest as a result of the november 2004 mpsc final rate order which was partially offset by higher 2005 storm expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 169 million and 117 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 increase was due to a 112 million net stranded cost writeoff related to the september 2006 mpsc order regarding stranded costs and a 19 million increase in our asset retirement obligation at our fermi 1 nuclear facility we also had increased amortization of regulatory assets of 19 million related to electric customer choice and 8 million related to our securitized assets the 2005 increase reflects the income effect of recording regulatory assets in 2004 which lowered depreciation and 

amortization expenses the regulatory asset deferrals totaled 46 million in 2005 and 107 million in 2004 additionally higher 2005 sales volumes compared to 2004 resulted in greater amortization of regulatory assets 

asset gains and losses net decreased 20 million in 2006 and increased 25 million in 2005 primarily as a result of our 2005 sale of land near our headquarters in detroit michigan 

other income and deductions expense increased 11 million in 2006 and decreased 20 million in 2005 the 2006 increase is attributable to higher interest expense due to increased longterm debt the 2005 decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense as a result of lower interest rates and a favorable adjustment related to tax audit settlements 

outlook — we continue to improve the operating performance of detroit edison during the past year we have resolved a portion of our regulatory issues and continue to pursue additional regulatory andor legislative solutions for structural problems within the michigan market structure primarily electric customer choice and the need to adjust rates for each customer class to reflect the full cost of service 

concurrently we will move forward in our efforts to continue to improve performance looking forward additional issues such as rising prices for coal health care and higher levels of capital spending will result in us taking meaningful action to address our costs while continuing to provide quality customer service we will utilize the dte energy operating system and the performance excellence process to seek opportunities to improve productivity remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

long term we will be required to invest an estimated 24 billion on emission controls through 2018 should we be able to recover these costs in future rate cases we may experience a growth in earnings 

additionally our service territory may require additional generation capacity a new baseload generating plant has not been built within the state of michigan in the last 20 years should our regulatory environment be conducive to such a significant capital expenditure we may build or expand a new base load coal or nuclear facility while we have not decided on construction of a new baseload nuclear facility in february 2007 we announced that we will prepare a license application for construction and operation of a new nuclear power plant on the site of fermi 2 by completing the license application before the end of 2008 we may qualify for financial incentives under the federal energy policy act of 2005 we are also studying the possible transfer of a gasfired peaking electric generating plant from our nonutility operations to our electric utility to support future power generation requirements 

the following variables either in combination or acting alone could impact our future results 

 

we expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk due to the electric customer choice program until the issues associated with this program are adequately addressed we will accrue as regulatory assets any future unrecovered generationrelated fixed costs stranded costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation and mpsc orders we cannot predict the outcome of these matters see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in january 2007 the mpsc submitted the state of michigan’s 21 st century energy plan to the governor of michigan the plan recommends that michigan’s future energy needs be met through a combination of 

renewable resources and cleanest generating technology with significant energy savings achieved by increased energy efficiency the plan also recommends 

 

we continue to review the energy plan and are unable to predict the impact on the company of the implementation of the plan 

gas utility 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens fuel gas company citizens natural gas utilities subject to regulation by the mpsc michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million residential commercial and industrial customers in the state of michigan michcon also has subsidiaries involved in the gathering and transmission of natural gas in northern michigan michcon operates one of the largest natural gas distribution and transmission systems in the united states citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

factors impacting income gas utility’s net income increased 13 million in 2006 and increased 17 million in 2005 the variances were primarily attributable to increased rates and the impacts in 2005 of the mpsc’s april 2005 gas cost recovery and gas rate orders and the effect of milder weather in 2006 

the 2005 mpsc gas rate order disallowed recovery of 90 of the costs of a computer billing system that was in place prior to dte energy’s acquisition of mcn energy in 2001 michcon impaired this asset by approximately 42 million in the first quarter of 2005 this disallowance was not reflected at the dte energy level since this impairment was previously reserved at the time of the mcn acquisition in 2001 

 

gross margin increased 44 million and 37 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively gross margins were favorably affected by higher base rate revenues of 15 million and 42 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively revenue associated with the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism authorized by the mpsc in the april 2005 gas rate order increased 22 million and 11 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally 2006 was impacted by a 17 million favorable impact in lost gas recognized and an increase of 24 million in midstream services including storage and transportation partially offsetting these increases were declines of 31 million due to warmer than normal weather and 26 million as a result of customer conservation and lower volumes the comparability of 2006 to 2005 is also affected 

by an adjustment we recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to an april 2005 mpsc order in our 2002 gcr reconciliation case that disallowed 26 million representing unbilled revenues at december 2001 

 

the 2005 final rate order provided revenue for an uncollectible expense trueup mechanism uetm to mitigate the effect of increasing uncollectible expense the revenue recorded related to the uetm was 33 million for 2006 and 11 million for 2005 

uncollectible accounts expense 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 7 million and 21 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 increase is due to a 14 million increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices continued weak economic conditions and inadequate governmentsponsored assistance for lowincome customers in 2006 we recorded 24 million in implementation costs associated with our performance excellence process and we recognized 9 million of lower injuries and damages expenses and lower labor and employee incentives the comparability of 2006 to 2005 and the comparability of 2005 to 2004 was affected by an adjustment we recorded in the second quarter of 2005 for the disallowance of 11 million in environmental costs due to the april 2005 final gas rate order and the requirement to defer negative pension expense as a regulatory liability additionally the comparability was impacted by the dte energy parent company no longer allocating 9 million of mergerrelated interest to michcon effective in april 2005 

asset gains and losses net increased 4 million and decreased 7 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 change was due to a 3 million gain on the sale of investment rights related to storage field construction which was offset by a 3 million loss due to a reduction to michcon’s 2004 gcr underrecovery related to the accounting treatment of the injected base gas remaining in the new haven storage field when it was sold in early 2004 the 7 million decline in 2005 was primarily the result of a writeoff of certain computer equipment and related depreciation resulting from the april 2005 final rate order 

income tax provision increased by 13 million in 2006 and income tax benefit decreased 7 million in 2005 primarily due to variations in pretax earnings 

outlook — operating results are expected to vary due to regulatory proceedings weather changes in economic conditions customer conservation and process improvements higher gas prices and economic conditions have resulted in continued pressure on receivables and working capital requirements that are partially mitigated by the gcr mechanism in the april 2005 final gas rate order the mpsc adopted michcon’s proposed tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable each year michcon will file an application comparing its actual uncollectible expense for the prior calendar year to its designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million ninety percent of the difference will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 

we will utilize the dte energy operating system and the performance excellence process to seek opportunities to improve productivity remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

nonutility operations 

coal and gas midstream 

coal and gas midstream consists of coal transportation and marketing and the pipelines processing and storage businesses 

coal transportation and marketing provides fuel transportation and rail equipment management services we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers additionally we participate in coal marketing and coaltopower tolling transactions as well as the purchase and sale of emissions credits we perform coal mine methane extraction in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines industrial users or for small power generation projects 

pipelines processing and storage owns a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline six carbon dioxide processing facilities and two natural gas storage fields the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by stable longterm fixed price revenue contracts the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations pursuant to an operating agreement michcon provides 

physical operations maintenance and technical support for the washington 28 and washington 10 storage facilities 

factors impacting income  net income increased 5 million and 12 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

operating revenues remained the same in 2006 and increased 118 million in 2005 in 2006 our coal transportation and marketing business experienced lower synfuel related volumes which were offset by an increase in storage revenues in the pipelines processing and storage business during 2005 our coal transportation and marketing business experienced higher throughput volumes and increased prices for coal 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 25 million in 2006 and increased 111 million in 2005  the 2006 decrease was due to lower synfuel related volumes and decreased expenses at our coal transportation and marketing business due to decreased marketing volume during 2005 our coal transportation and marketing business experienced higher throughput volumes and increased prices for coal 

other income and deductions decreased 12 million in 2006 and increased 8 million in 2005 the 2006 decrease is primarily attributed to higher interest expense as a result of our storage expansion construction 

income tax provision increased 6 million for 2006 and increased 3 million in 2005 reflecting variations in pretax income 

outlook — we expect to continue to grow our coal transportation and marketing business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments however a portion of our coal transportation and marketing revenues and net income are dependent upon our synfuel operations and were adversely impacted by the temporary idling of the synfuel facilities in 2006 coal transportation and marketing is involved in a contract dispute with bnsf railway company that has been referred to arbitration see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our pipeline processing and storage business will continue its steady growth plan in april 2006 pipelines processing and storage placed into service over 14 bcf of storage capacity at an existing michigan storage field and plans to file a mpsc application early in 2007 for a new gas storage reservoir which will increase its overall working gas storage capacity by 80 bcf to a total of 74 bcf in december 2006 washington 28 filed an application with the mpsc requesting an increase in its working gas storage capacity to 160 bcf vector pipeline has secured longterm market commitments to support an expansion project for approximately 200 mmcf per day with a projected inservice date of november 2007 vector pipeline received ferc approval for this expansion in october 2006 pipeline processing and storage has a 2625 ownership interest in millennium pipeline which received ferc approval for construction and operation in december 2006 millennium pipeline is scheduled to be in service in late 2008 in october 2006 we purchased the lessor interest in the 66 bcf washington 10 gas storage field prior to the purchase we leased the storage rights and lease obligations 

were recorded as operating leases we plan to expand existing assets and develop new assets which are typically supported with longterm customer commitments 

unconventional gas production 

unconventional gas production is primarily engaged in natural gas exploration development and production our unconventional gas production business produces gas from the antrim and barnett shales and sells most of the gas to the energy trading segment 

factors impacting income  net income increased 5 million in 2006 and decreased 2 million in 2005 the 2006 results were primarily impacted by an increase in barnett shale production and an increase in net gas prices for antrim shale partially offsetting these revenue increases were higher operating and depletion expenses associated with increased production and the operation of new wells the decline in 2005 was due to higher operating and michigan severance tax expenses 

 

operating revenues increased 25 million in 2006 due to increased barnett shale production and increased 3 million in 2005 due primarily to higher gas prices 

operation and maintenance expense increased 7 million in 2006 and 3 million in 2005 increases are associated with the addition of approximately 285 net producing wells during the threeyear period 

depreciation depletion and amortization increased 7 million in 2006 and 2 million in 2005 the yeartoyear increases were associated with higher gas production and higher finding costs associated with barnett shale wells 

taxes other than income were the same in 2006 due to severance taxes that were impacted by lower gas prices which was offset by higher gas production and increased 4 million in 2005 due to higher severance taxes associated with gas price increases on relatively flat antrim gas volumes 

assets gains and losses net increased 3 million in 2006 primarily due to the sale of a working interest in unproved property 

other income and deductions increased 5 million in 2006 and decreased 2 million in 2005 interest expense was the primary contributor to the variances the 2006 increase in interest expense was attributed to higher average affiliate notes payable balances 

outlook — we expect to continue to develop our proved areas and test unproved areas in michigan and texas evaluation of barnett shale test wells in up to three new areas is ongoing during 2007 we expect barnett shale production of 87 bcfe of natural gas compared with approximately 41 bcfe in 2006 and antrim shale production roughly equivalent to the 215 bcfe produced in 2006 we expect to invest a combined amount of approximately 150 million to 170 million in our unconventional gas production business in 2007 we are exploring the sale of a portion of our unconventional gas production assets 

which will allow us to monetize value from our more mature holdings while retaining the ability to benefit from the upside of our earlier stage holdings 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver utilitytype services to industrial commercial and institutional customers and biomass energy projects we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries these services include pulverized coal and petroleum coke supply power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply we own and operate three gasfired peaking electric generating plants and a biomassfired electric generating plant and operate one additional gasfired power plant under contract additionally we own a gasfired peaking electric generating plant that was taken out of service in september 2006 we develop own and operate landfill gas recovery systems throughout the united states we produce metallurgical coke from two coke batteries the production of coke from our coke batteries generates production tax credits 

factors impacting income  power and industrial projects’ reported a net loss of 80 million in 2006 and net income of 4 million in 2005 the 2006 net loss is primarily due to impairments the 2005 net income is attributed to the acquisitions of four onsite energy projects and coke operations in 2005 

 

operating revenues decreased 19 million in 2006 and 20 million in 2005 the 2006 decrease is primarily due to lower coke prices and lower pulverized coal sales the 2005 decrease reflects the impact from the sale of our interest in a coke battery in 2005 offset by increases at another owned coke battery due to increased output and increased prices the 2006 and 2005 decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from our onsite energy projects reflecting the addition of new facilities completion of new longterm utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large manufacturer of paper products 

operation and maintenance expense increased 37 million in 2006 and decreased 55 million in 2005 reflecting the 2005 acquisitions of three onsite energy projects and coke operations the 2005 decrease reflects the impact from the sale of an interest in a coke battery in 2005 resulting in a decrease in expense offset by increases in costs at another owned coke battery reflecting increased output 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net increased 76 million in 2006 in 2006 we recorded a 42 million impairment for one of our 100 owned natural gasfired generating plants and a 14 million impairment at our landfill gas recovery unit relating to the writedown of longlived assets at several landfill sites also during 2006 we recorded a pretax impairment loss of 19 million for the write down of fixed assets and patents at our waste coal recovery business 

other income and deductions increased 39 million in 2006 primarily due to a 32 million impairment of a 50 equity interest in a natural gasfired generating plant 

income taxes declined 49 million in 2006 and increased 12 million in 2005 reflecting changes in pretax income 

outlook – power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy business the coke battery and landfill gas recovery businesses generate production tax credits that are subject to an oil pricerelated phaseout due to the relatively low level of production tax credits generated by our coke battery and landfill gas recovery business a partial or full phaseout of production tax credits in these two businesses is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations cash flow and financial position we are exploring the combination of a sale of an equity interest in and recapitalization of some of the assets of the power and industrial projects business including the sale or restructuring of the power generation assets in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell our georgetown peaking electric generating facility the sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2007 

energy trading 

energy trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants and the optimization of contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies large industrials and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading is integral in providing commodity risk management services to the other unregulated businesses within dte energy 

factors impacting income  net income increased 139 million in 2006 and decreased 128 million in 2005 the 2006 increase is attributed to increased marktomarket and realized power and gas positions that resulted from significant 2005 marktomarket losses on derivative contracts used to economically hedge our gas in storage and forward power contracts the 2005 decrease is attributed to decreased marktomarket and realized power and gas positions 

 

gross margin increased 221 million in 2006 and decreased 186 million in 2005 the 2006 increase is attributed to a 168 million marktomarket increase on power and gas positions and a 57 million increase in realized power and gas positions the 2006 results reflect the timing differences from 2005 that largely reversed and favorably impacted earnings the 2005 decrease is due to a 121 million marktomarket decrease on power and gas positions and a 66 million decrease in realized power and gas positions the 2005 results reflect the economically favorable decision in early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas 

operation and maintenance expense increased 22 million in 2006 and 2 million in 2005 the 2006 increases were due to higher incentive expenses of 14 million resulting from our strong economic performance and higher corporate allocation charges of 10 million 

other income and deductions decreased 16 million in 2006 and increased 8 million in 2005 the 2006 decrease is attributed to 6 million of lower intercompany interest expense and 8 million of higher intercompany interest income resulting from favorable operating cash flows to fund intercompany loans 

income tax provision increased 72 million in 2006 and decreased 68 million in 2005 primarily due to variations in pretax earnings 

outlook  significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as capacity positions of natural gas storage and pipelines and power transmission contracts the financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the owned gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative assets the majority of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle which does not coincide with the calendar and fiscal year but runs annually from april of one year to march of the next year our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of storage with overthecounter forwards and futures this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods we are exploring strategic options for the energy trading business 

see “fair value of contracts” section that follows 

synthetic fuel 

synthetic fuel is comprised of the nine synfuel plants that we operate and that produce synthetic fuel the production of synthetic fuel from the synfuel plants generates production tax credits 

factors impacting income  synthetic fuel net income decreased 257 million in 2006 and increased 106 million in 2005 the decline in 2006 was due to higher oil prices resulting in reduced gains from selling interests in our synfuel plants lower levels of production tax credits and asset impairments and reserves the increase in 2005 reflects higher gains recognized from selling interests in our synfuel plants gains on synfuel hedges and increased levels of production tax credits 

 

operating revenues decreased 64 million in 2006 and increased 277 million in 2005 revenues were lower in 2006 due to our decision to temporarily idle production at all nine of the synfuel facilities revenues increased in 2005 primarily reflecting higher synfuel sales due to increased production 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 148 million in 2006 and increased 335 million in 2005 operation and maintenance expense declined in 2006 due to our decision to temporarily idle production at 

all nine of the synfuel facilities for a portion of the year operating and maintenance expense in 2005 increased reflecting costs associated with increased synthetic fuel production 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net decreased 407 million in 2006 and increased 148 million in 2005 in 2006 and 2005 we deferred gains from the sale of the synfuel facilities including in 2006 a portion of gains related to fixed payments due to the increase in oil prices and the resulting decrease in production and sales volumes we recorded an accrual for contractual partners’ obligations of 79 million pretax in 2006 reflecting the possible refund of amounts equal to our partners’ capital contributions or for operating losses that would normally be paid by our partners we recorded other synfuelrelated reserves and impairments in 2006 of 78 million to economically hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices and the resulting reduction in synfuel sales proceeds we entered into derivative and other contracts the derivative contracts are markedtomarket with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains we recorded net 2006 synfuel hedge marktomarket gains of 60 million compared with net 2005 synfuel hedge marktomarket gains of 47 million in 2004 we recorded mark tomarket losses of 12 million see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 minority interest decreased 67 million in 2006 and increased 95 million in 2005 reflecting our partners’ share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations as well as our partners’ 70 million share of the asset impairment in 2006 the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during prior periods resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our partners 

income taxes declined 105 million in 2006 and increased 33 million in 2005 reflecting changes in pretax income due to synfuel related loss reserves and the impairment of fixed assets compared to pretax income in 2005 

outlook – due to the implementation of our hedging strategy we expect to continue to operate the synfuel plants through december 31 2007 when synfuelrelated production tax credits expire 

corporate  other 

corporate  other includes various corporate staff functions as these functions support the entire company their costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized therefore the effect of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year additionally corporate  other holds certain nonutility debt assets held for sale and energyrelated investments 

factors impacting income  corporate  other results declined by 9 million in 2006 and declined 40 million in 2005 the 2006 decline was primarily due to higher michigan single business taxes the 2005 decline was primarily a result of the parent company not allocating merger interest to detroit edison and michcon partially offsetting 2005 increased expenses were reduced michigan single business taxes and gains on the sale of nonstrategic assets 

discontinued operations 

dte georgetown georgetown  — we own georgetown an 80 mw natural gasfired peaking electric generating plant in the fourth quarter of 2006 management approved the marketing of georgetown for sale in december 2006 georgetown met the sfas no 144 criteria of an asset “held for sale” and we reported its operating results as a discontinued operation we did not recognize an impairment loss since the carrying value of georgetown’s assets less costs to sell approximated its fair value in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell our georgetown peaking electric generating facility the sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2007 

dte energy technologies dtech  we own dtech which assembled marketed distributed and serviced distributed generation products provided application engineering and monitored and managed onsite generation system operations in july 2005 management approved the restructuring of this business resulting in the identification of certain assets and liabilities to be sold or abandoned primarily associated with standby and continuous duty generation sales and service we recognized a net of tax restructuring loss of 23 million during the third quarter of 2005 primarily representing the write down to fair value of the assets of dtech less costs to sell and the writeoff of goodwill as we execute the restructuring plan there may be adjustments to amounts recorded related to the impairment and exit costs 

southern missouri gas company smgc  we owned smgc a public utility engaged in the distribution transmission and sale of natural gas in southern missouri in the first quarter of 2004 management approved the marketing of smgc for sale as of march 31 2004 smgc met the criteria of an asset “held for sale” and we have reported its operating results as a discontinued operation we recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately 7 million representing the writedown to fair value of the assets of smgc less costs to sell and the writeoff of allocated goodwill in november 2004 we entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of smgc regulatory approval was received in april 2005 and the sale closed in may 2005 during the second quarter of 2005 we recognized a net of tax gain of 2 million 

international transmission company itc  in february 2003 we sold itc our electric transmission business to affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co and trimaran capital partners llc through december 31 2004 we recorded a gain of 58 million net of tax during the second quarter of 2005 the gain was adjusted to 56 million net of tax 

see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cumulative effect of accounting changes 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment using the modified prospective transition method the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas 123r was an increase in net income of 1 million as a result of estimating forfeitures for previously granted stock awards and performance shares 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 143 that required additional new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2005 earnings by 3 million 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2007 of up to 14 billion the capital needs 

of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures we may spend an additional 125 million on growthrelated projects within our nonutility businesses in 2007 

capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2007 primarily as a result of environmental spending we anticipate environmental expenditures of approximately 253 million in 2007 and up to approximately 23 billion of future capital expenditures to satisfy both existing and proposed new requirements 

we expect nonutility capital spending will approximate 300 million to 400 million annually for the next several years capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

debt maturing in 2007 totals approximately 346 million 

we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital requirements 

 

cash from operating activities 

a majority of the company’s operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs our nonutility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise primarily from the synthetic fuels business which we believe subject to considerations discussed below will provide up to approximately 900 million of cash during 20072009 

cash from operations totaling 15 billion in 2006 was up 455 million from the comparable 2005 period the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of 352 million in net income after adjusting for 

noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains and a 103 million decrease in working capital and other requirements most of the improvement was driven by higher net income at detroit edison which was the result of improved revenues and gross margin stemming from a full year of higher rates granted in the 2004 rate orders and lower customer choice penetration the working capital improvement was driven by michcon which resulted primarily from declining gcr factors which had the effect of lowering customer accounts receivable balances this improvement was partially offset by working capital requirements at detroit edison which resulted from pension and veba contributions totaling 271 million in 2006 

cash from operations totaling 10 billion in 2005 was up 6 million from the comparable 2004 period the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over 83 million in net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains substantially offset by a 77 million increase in working capital and other requirements most of the improvement was driven by higher net income at detroit edison which was the result of improved revenues and gross margin stemming from higher rates granted in the 2004 rate orders warmer weather and lower customer choice penetration the offsetting increase in working capital requirements was driven by a 127 million pscr underrecovery in 2005 as compared to a 112 million overrecovery in 2004 working capital requirements also reflect the higher cost of gas at michcon and our energy trading segment michcon’s working capital and other requirements were 136 million higher in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher gas costs this impact was reflected by accounts receivable balances that were 198 million higher at december 31 2005 than the previous year at michcon the increase in working capital requirements was mitigated by lower income tax payments in 2005 and company initiatives to improve cash flow including better inventory management cash sales transactions and the utilization of letters of credit 

outlook — we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily due to improvements from higher earnings at our utilities we are incurring costs associated with implementation of our performance excellence process but we expect to realize sustained net cost savings beginning in 2007 we also may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our pscr and gcr costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of mpsc orders gas prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives 

we anticipate approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet we expect to use any such cash and the potential cash from monetization of certain of our nonutility assets and operations to reduce debt and repurchase common stock and to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria we repurchased one million shares of common stock in december 2006 our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios to improve our current credit rating and outlook and to have any monetization be accretive to earnings per share 

cash from investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements capital spending within our nonutility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we invest tentatively based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be 

determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

net cash outflows relating to investing activities increased 392 million in 2006 compared to 2005 the 2006 change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures the increase in capital expenditures was driven by environmental enterprise business systems development and distribution projects at detroit edison pipeline reliability and inventory management projects at michcon and growthoriented projects across our nonutility segments 

net cash outflows relating to investing activities increased 121 million in 2005 the increase was primarily due to increased capital expenditures partially offset by higher synfuel proceeds spending on growth project investments increased 123 million in 2005 while spending on environmental projects was 44 million higher than the 2004 period 

longer term with the expected improvement at our utilities and assuming continued cash generation from the synfuel business cash flows are expected to improve we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

cash from financing activities 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by the company’s operations shortterm borrowings which are mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 to 52 to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our longterm debt and strengthening our balance sheet the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs 

net cash used for financing activities increased 36 million during 2006 compared to 2005 due mostly to a decrease in shortterm borrowings and issuance of common stock and longterm debt partially offset by a decrease in debt redemptions 

net cash used for financing activities improved 145 million in 2005 due primarily to the issuance of common stock which resulted from the conversion of our equity security units 

see notes 11 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in august 2006 dte energy and detroit edison filed a combined shelf registration statement for the issuance of securities in an unlimited amount for three years from its effective date michcon has a separate effective registration statement providing for the issuance of 200 million of securities 

common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash in january 2005 we announced that the dte energy board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 700 million in common stock through 2008 the authorization provides company management with flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time and will depend on future cash flows and investment opportunities we repurchased one million shares of our common stock in december 2006 we also contributed 170 million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of 2004 in august 2005 we issued 37 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the settlement of the stock purchase component of our equity security units 

contractual obligations 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities management believes that the current credit ratings of the company provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to the company may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various nonutility subsidiaries in the event that our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately 383 million at december 31 2006 additionally upon a downgrade our trading business could be required to restrict operations and our access to the shortterm commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating agencies all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities 

 

critical accounting estimates 

there are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment such estimates relate to regulation risk management and trading activities production tax credits goodwill pension and postretirement costs the allowance for doubtful accounts and legal and tax reserves 

regulation 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of our businesses 

if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no 71 on all our operations we estimate that the extraordinary loss would be as follows 

 

 

 management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

risk management and trading activities 

all derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as “assets or 1iabilities from risk management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended 

the offsetting entry to “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge accounting the fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each reporting period for changes using market sources such as 

 

market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective transparent prices can be obtained unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this criterion 

production tax credits 

we generate production tax credits from our synfuel coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations we recognize earnings as tax credits are generated at our facilities in one of two ways first to the extent we have sold an interest in our synfuel facilities to third parties we recognize gains as synfuel is produced and sold and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable when probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is reasonably assured second to the extent we generate credits to our own account we recognize earnings through reduced tax expense 

all production tax credits are subject to audit by the irs however all of our synfuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations audits of five of our synfuel facilities were successfully completed in the past two years if production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be a significant writeoff of previously recorded earnings from such tax credits 

tax credits generated by our facilities were 295 million in 2006 as compared to 617 million in 2005 and 449 million in 2004 the portion of tax credits generated for our own account was 35 million in 2006 as compared to 55 million in 2005 and 38 million in 2004 with the remaining credits generated allocated to third party partners 

goodwill 

certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in order to perform these impairment tests we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation techniques which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

as of december 31 2006 our goodwill totaled 21 billion the majority of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units the value of the utility reporting units may be significantly impacted by rate orders and the regulatory environment 

we also have 4 million of goodwill allocated to the synthetic fuel reporting unit the value of the synthetic fuel reporting unit has been impacted by the anticipated phaseout of tax credits as of december 31 2006 we have evaluated the impact of a phaseout of synfuel tax credits on our valuation assumptions we have determined that the fair value of the synthetic fuel reporting unit exceeds the carrying value and no impairment of goodwill exists these assumptions may change as the value of the synfuel tax credits change 

during 2005 we recorded an impairment of 16 million to goodwill related to discontinuing the operations of dtech 

based on our 2006 goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of our remaining operating reporting units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed we will continue to monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections 

pension and postretirement costs 

our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors including rates of return on plan assets the discount rate the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions 

we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of 125 million in 2006 including special termination benefits of 49 million 90 million in 2005 and 81 million in 2004 postretirement benefits costs for all plans were 197 million in 2006 including special termination benefits of 8 million 155 million in 2005 and 125 million in 2004 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2006 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 875 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated input from our consultants including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity and bond markets our 2007 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 65 in equity markets 20 in fixed income markets and 15 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe that 875 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2007 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded we have unrecognized net gains due to the performance of the financial markets as of december 31 2006 we had 39 million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased from 59 at december 31 2005 to 57 at december 31 2006 due to recent company contributions financial market performance and lower discount rates we estimate that our 2007 pension costs will approximate 66 million excluding special termination benefits compared to 85 million excluding special termination benefits in 2006 and our 2007 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 184 million compared to 189 million excluding special termination benefits of 8 million in 2006 in the last several years we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design additionally future pension costs for detroit edison will be affected by a pension tracking mechanism which was authorized by the mpsc in its november 2004 rate order the tracking mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in detroit edison’s base rates in april 2005 the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of michcon’s negative pension expense michcon will record a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2006 qualified pension costs by approximately 22 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2006 pension costs by approximately 10 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by onepercentagepoint would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2006 by approximately 25 million 

the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the financial markets the value of our plan assets was 33 billion at december 31 2004 and november 30 2005 the value at november 30 2006 was 35 billion the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional minimum pension liability an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders’ equity in 2004 and 2005 at december 31 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 that required us to recognize the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement plans the impact of the adoption of sfas 158 was an increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities of approximately 13 billion we requested and received agreement from the mpsc to record the additional liability amounts for the detroit edison and michcon benefit plans on the statement of financial position as a regulatory asset as a result regulatory assets were increased by approximately 12 billion the remainder of the increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without substantial returns in the financial markets we made a 170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in 2004 we did not make pension contributions in 2005 and made a 180 million cash contribution in 2006 at the discretion of management we anticipate making up to a 180 million contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2007 and up to 600 million over the next five years also we anticipate making up to a 15 million contribution to our nonqualified benefit plans in 2007 and up to 35 million over the next five years we contributed 80 million to our postretirement plans in 2004 we did not contribute to our postretirement plans in 2005 and made a 116 million contribution to our postretirement benefit plans in 2006 at the discretion of management we anticipate making up to a 116 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2007 and up to 580 million over the next five years 

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act was signed into law this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law the effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced costs by 17 million in 2006 20 million in 2005 and 16 million in 2004 

see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers historical trends economic conditions age of receivables and other information higher customer bills due to increased gas prices the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2005 and 2006 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates as part of the 2005 rate order for michcon the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible accounts tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in light of rising energy prices would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 

legal and tax reserves 

we are involved in various legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the company tax reserves are based upon management’s assessment of potential adjustments to tax positions taken we regularly review ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience in addition to current tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments 

environmental matters 

protecting the environment as well as correcting past environmental damage continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators legislation andor rulemaking could further impact the electric utility 

industry including detroit edison the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to cleanup contaminated property 

electric utility 

air  detroit edison is subject to epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in march 2005 epa issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements detroit edison has spent approximately 875 million through 2006 we estimate detroit edison will incur future capital expenditures of up to 222 million in 2007 and up to 2 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements 

the epa has ongoing enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison in october 2003 the epa promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review provisions going forward several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and in december 2003 a stay was issued until the us court of appeals dc circuit renders an opinion in the case we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address the climate change issue there may be legislative action to address the issue of changes in climate that result from the build up of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere we cannot predict the impact any legislative action may have on the company 

water – in response to an epa regulation currently under judicial review detroit edison may be required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of the studies to be conducted over the next several years detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes initially we estimated that we will incur up to approximately 53 million over the next three to five years in additional capital expenditures to comply with these requirements however a recent court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation which may result in a delay in compliance requirements the court decision also raised the possibility that the company may have to install cooling towers at some facilities we cannot predict the effect on detroit edison of this court decision or any resulting regulations 

contaminated sites  detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including two former mgp sites the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations we have a reserve balance of 11 million as of december 31 2006 for the remediation of these sites over the next several years in addition detroit edison expects to make approximately 5 million of capital improvements to the ash landfill in 2007 

gas utility 

contaminated sites  prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil gas utility owns or previously owned 15 former mgp sites investigations have revealed contamination related to the by–products of gas manufacturing at each site in addition to the mpg sites gas utility is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years as a result of these determinations we have recorded liabilities of 41 million and 1 million for the mgps and other contaminated sites respectively it is estimated that gas utility may incur 5 million in expenses related to cleanup costs in 2007 

in 1993 a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism was approved by the mpsc for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former mgp sites in excess of this reserve after a study was completed in 1995 gas utility accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of 35 million during 2006 we spent approximately 2 million investigating and remediating these former mgp sites in december 2006 we retained multiple environmental consultants to estimate the project cost to remediate each mgp site we accrued an additional 7 million in remediation liabilities associated with former mgp holders and additional cleanup cost to increase the reserve balance to 41 million as of december 31 2006 

any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and thereby affect the company’s financial position and cash flows however we anticipate the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the mpsc will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

other 

our nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we are in the process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facility in michigan we expect the project to be completed within one year our nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 

various state and federal laws regulate our handling storage and disposal of waste materials the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property we have extensive land holdings and from time to time must investigate claims of improperly disposed contaminants we anticipate our utility and nonutility companies may periodically be included in various types of environmental proceedings 

enterprise business systems 

in 2003 we began the development of our enterprise business systems ebs project an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems relating to finance human resources supply chain and work management as part of this initiative we are implementing ebs software including among others products developed by sap ag and mro software inc the first phase of implementation occurred in 2005 in the regulated electric fossil generation unit additional phases of implementation are planned for 2007 the conversion of data and the implementation and operation of the ebs will be continuously monitored and reviewed and should ultimately strengthen our internal control structure and lead to increased cost efficiencies although our implementation plan includes detailed testing and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and successful transition we can provide no assurance that complications will not arise that could interrupt our operations 

we have spent approximately 330 million through the end of 2006 and expect total spending over the life of the project to be between 375 million and 400 million we expect the benefits of lower costs faster business cycles repeatable and optimized processes enhanced internal controls improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs to outweigh the expense of our investment in this initiative 

miso 

the miso was formed in 1996 by its member transmission owners and in december 2001 received ferc approval as a regional transmission organization rto authorized to provide regional transmission services as prescribed by ferc in its order 2000 order 2000 requires an rto to perform eight functions including tariff administration transmission system congestion management provision of ancillary services to support transmission operations market monitoring interregional coordination and 

the coordination of system planning and expansion miso’s independence from ownership of either generation or transmission facilities is intended to enable it to ensure fair access to the transmission grid and through its congestion management role miso is also charged with ensuring grid reliability miso’s initial provision of transmission services in december 2001 was known as day 1 operations 

in keeping with order 2000 which permits rtos to provide realtime energy imbalance services and a marketbased mechanism for congestion management miso on april 1 2005 launched its midwest energy market or day 2 operations and began regional wholesale electric market operations and transmission service throughout its area a key feature of the midwest energy market is the establishment of locational marginal prices lmps which provide price transparency for the sale and purchase of wholesale electricity at different locations in the market territory the lmp is the market clearing price at a specific pricing location in the midwest energy market that is equal to the cost of supplying the next increment of load at that location the value of an lmp is the same whether a purchase or sale is made at that location detroit edison participates in the midwest energy market by offering its generation on a dayahead and real time basis and by bidding for power in the market to serve its load the cost of power procured from the market net of any gain realized from generation sold into the market is included and recovered through the pscr mechanism in addition lmps are expected to encourage new generation to locate where the power produced is of most value to the load and is expected to identify where new transmission facilities are needed to relieve grid congestion 

miso is compensated for assuring grid reliability and for supporting the energy market through fercapproved rates charged to load detroit edison became a nontransmission owning member of miso in compliance with section 10w 1 of pa 141 the mpsc has ordered that miso costs charged to detroit edison should be recovered through the pscr mechanism 

federal energy policy act of 2005 

in august 2005 the energy policy act of 2005 energy act was signed into law among other provisions the energy act 

 

the implementation of the energy act requires proceedings at the state level and development of regulations by the ferc as well as other federal agencies the impact of the energy act on our results of operations will depend on the implementation of final rules and cannot be fully determined at this time 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

fair value of contracts 

the following disclosures provide enhanced transparency of the derivative activities and position of our trading businesses and our other businesses 

we use the criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted to determine if certain contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments the rules for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex moreover significant judgment is required to 

determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently if a contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument it is recorded in the financial statements as “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” at the fair value of the contract the recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted quarterly to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract a practice known as marktomarket mtm accounting 

fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an armslength transaction to determine the fair value of contracts accounted for as derivative instruments we use a combination of quoted market prices and mathematical valuation models valuation models require various inputs including forward prices volatility interest rates and exercise periods 

contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments are power gas and oil forwards futures options and swaps as well as foreign currency contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives and which are therefore excluded from the following tables include gas inventory gas storage and transportation arrangements fullrequirements power contracts and gas and oil reserves as subsequently discussed we have fully reserved the value of derivative contracts beyond the liquid trading timeframe thereby not impacting income 

the subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating characteristics and key risks 

 

rollforward of marktomarket energy contract net assets 

the following tables provide details on changes in our marktomarket net asset or liability position during 2006 

 

 

 the following table provides a current and noncurrent analysis of “assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities” as reflected on the consolidated statement of financial position as of december 31 2006 amounts that relate to contracts that become due within twelve months are classified as current and all remaining amounts are classified as noncurrent 

 

maturity of fair value of mtm energy contract net assets 

we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe our intent is to recognize mtm activity only when pricing data is obtained from active quotes and published indexes actively quoted and published indexes include exchange traded ie nymex and overthecounter positions for which broker quotes are available although the nymex has currently quoted prices for the next 72 months broker quotes for gas and power are generally available for 18 and 24 months into the future respectively we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact income 

as a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles the tables above do not include the expected favorable earnings impacts of certain nonderivative gas storage and power contracts we entered into economically favorable transactions in early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price 

for natural gas we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in storage in addition we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts we expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will be fully realized by the end of 2007 

the table below shows the maturity of our mtm positions 

 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

the electric and gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations further changes in the price of electricity can impact the level of exposure of customer choice programs and uncollectible expenses at the electric utility in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost gas storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the gas utility 

to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the utility businesses have applied various approaches to manage this risk the approaches include forward energy capacity storage and futures contracts as well as regulatory raterecovery mechanisms regulatory raterecovery occurs in the form of pscr and gcr mechanisms see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and a tracking mechanism to mitigate some losses from customer migration due to electric customer choice programs 

the nonutility businesses have risk in conjunction with electricity natural gas crude oil and coal 

our power and industrial projects and synthetic fuel segments are subject to crude oil electricity natural gas and coal based product price risk as previously discussed production tax credits generated by dte energy’s synfuel coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations are subject to phaseout if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels the benefits associated with tax credits may be subject to changes in federal tax law also we have entered into a series of derivative contracts for 2007 to economically hedge the impact of oil prices on a portion of our synfuel cash flow see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements to limit our exposure to the other commodities we use forward energy capacity and futures contracts 

our unconventional gas production business segment has exposure to natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil price fluctuations these commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations to manage this exposure we use forward energy and futures contracts 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas and crude oil price fluctuations these risks are managed through its energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

our coal and gas midstream business segment has exposure to natural gas and coal price fluctuations these coal price risks are managed primarily through its coal transportation and marketing operations through the use of forward coal and futures contracts the gas midstream business unit manages its exposure through the sale of longterm storage and transportation contracts 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

we purchase and sell electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail and other industries certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the u s bankruptcy code we regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss we believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

other 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations

energy trading 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internally generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2006 the company has a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately 18 excluding securitized debt 

foreign currency risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations we have entered into a series of currency forward contracts through january 2011 additionally we may enter into fair value currency hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2006 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values 

the results of the sensitivity analysis calculations follow 

 

  

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the following consolidated financial statements and schedules are included herein 

 

controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management of the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of dte energy’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e as of december 31 2006 which is the end of the period covered by this report based on this evaluation the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that such controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be attained 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2006 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by the company’s independent auditors as stated in their report which is included herein 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

the company has established a formal assessment process and related procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting using criteria specified by coso the assessment process is comprehensive in scope utilizes internal and external resources and involves many individuals at various levels of the company in the design testing and evaluation of internal control 

as part of the evaluation and assessment process the company has been improving the design and operating effectiveness of many entitylevel and processlevel controls control testing and remediation activities provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting will be avoided the inherent limitations of our current internal controls a portion of which are manual by their nature contribute to the potential for control deficiencies management does not believe any areas requiring further improvement constitute a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 

there has been no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of dte energy company 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that dte energy company and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of december 31 2006 and for the year then ended and the financial statement schedule and our report dated march 1 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the company’s adoption of new accounting principles related to accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans and share based payments

note 1 — significant accounting policies 

corporate structure 

dte energy owns the following businesses 

 

detroit edison and michcon are regulated by the mpsc the ferc regulates certain activities of detroit edison’s business as well as various other aspects of businesses under dte energy in addition we are regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the nrc the epa and mdeq 

references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “company” or “dte” are to dte energy and its subsidiaries collectively 

principles of consolidation 

we consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which we have controlling influence nonmajority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when the company is able to influence the operating policies of the investee nonmajority owned investments include investments in limited liability companies partnerships or joint ventures when we do not influence the operating policies of an investee the cost method is used we eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions 

for entities that are considered variable interest entities we apply the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 

basis of presentation 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these accounting principles require us to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results may differ from our estimates 

revenues 

revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity and the sale delivery and storage of natural gas are recognized as services are provided detroit edison and michcon record revenues for electric and gas provided but unbilled at the end of each month 

detroit edison’s accrued revenues include a component for the cost of power sold that is recoverable through the pscr mechanism michcon’s accrued revenues include a component for the cost of gas sold 

that is recoverable through the gcr mechanism annual pscr and gcr proceedings before the mpsc permit detroit edison and michcon to recover prudent and reasonable supply costs any overcollection or undercollection of costs including interest will be reflected in future rates see note 6 

nonutility businesses recognize revenues as services are provided and products are delivered our energy trading segment records in revenues net unrealized derivative gains and losses on energy trading contracts including those to be physically settled 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income is the change in common shareholders’ equity during a period from transactions and events from nonowner sources including net income as shown in the following table amounts recorded to other comprehensive income at december 31 2006 include unrealized gains and losses from derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities minimum pension liabilities and pension and postretirement costs  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 158 effective december 31 2006 the minimum pension liability is no longer recognized pension and postretirement costs consisting of deferred actuarial losses prior service costs and transition amounts related to the pension and postretirement plans were recorded pursuant to sfas no 158 

 

cash equivalents and restricted cash 

cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand cash in banks and temporary investments purchased with remaining maturities of three months or less restricted cash consists of funds held to satisfy requirements of certain debt and partnership operating agreements restricted cash is classified as a current asset as all restricted cash is designated for interest and principal payments due within one year 

inventories 

we value fuel inventory and materials and supplies at average cost 

gas inventory at michcon is determined using the lastin firstout lifo method at december 31 2006 the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the 77 million lifo cost by 236 million during 2006 michcon liquidated 51 billion cubic feet of prior years’ lifo layers the liquidation reduced 2006 cost of gas by approximately 1 million but had no impact on earnings as a result of the gcr mechanism at december 31 2005 the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the 119 million lifo cost by 496 million during 2004 michcon liquidated 57 billion cubic feet of prior years’ lifo layers the liquidation reduced 2004 cost of gas by approximately 7 million but had no impact on earnings as a result of the gcr mechanism 

our energy trading segment uses the average cost method for its gas in inventory

property retirement and maintenance and depreciation and depletion 

summary of property by classification as of december 31 

 

property is stated at cost and includes constructionrelated labor materials overheads and an allowance for funds used during construction the cost of properties retired less salvage value at detroit edison and michcon is charged to accumulated depreciation 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred except for fermi 2 approximately 16 million of expenses related to the anticipated fermi 2 refueling outage scheduled for 2007 were accrued at december 31 2006 amounts are being accrued on a prorata basis over an 18month period that began in may 2006 we have utilized the accrueinadvance policy for nuclear refueling outage costs since the fermi 2 plant was placed in service in 1988 this method matches the regulatory recovery of these costs in rates set by the mpsc see note 3 

we base depreciation provisions for utility property at detroit edison and michcon on straightline and units of production rates approved by the mpsc the composite depreciation rate for detroit edison was 33 in 2006 34 in 2005 and 2004 the composite depreciation rate for michcon was 28 32 and 36 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

the average estimated useful life for each major class of utility property plant and equipment as of december 31 2006 follows 

 

nonutility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straightline decliningbalance or unitsofproduction methods the estimated useful lives for major classes of nonutility assets and facilities ranges from 20 to 40 years 

we credit depreciation depletion and amortization expense when we establish regulatory assets for stranded costs related to the electric customer choice program and deferred environmental expenditures we charge depreciation depletion and amortization expense when we amortize the regulatory assets we credit interest expense to reflect the accretion income on certain regulatory assets 

intangible assets relating to capitalized software are classified as property plant and equipment and the related amortization is included in accumulated depreciation and depletion on the consolidated statement of financial position we capitalize the costs associated with computer software we develop or obtain for use in our business we amortize intangible assets on a straightline basis over the expected period of benefit ranging from 5 to 20 years intangible assets amortization expense was 37 million in 2006 41 million in 2005 and 43 million in 2004 the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at december 31 2006 were 503 million and 108 million respectively the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at december 31 2005 were 470 million and 168 million respectively amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be 46 million annually for 2007 through 2011 

asset retirement obligations 

we have recorded asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations and fasb interpretation fin no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143  we have a legal retirement obligation for the decommissioning costs for our fermi 1 and fermi 2 nuclear plants to a lesser extent we have legal retirement obligations for the synthetic fuel operations gas production facilities gas gathering facilities and various other operations we have conditional retirement obligations for gas pipeline retirement costs and disposal of asbestos at certain of our power plants to a lesser extent we have conditional retirement obligations at certain service centers compressor and gate stations and disposal costs for pcb contained within transformers and circuit breakers 

for our regulated operations the adoptions of sfas no 143 and fin 47 resulted primarily in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs that we are currently recovering in rates we defer such differences under sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  

as a result of adopting fin 47 on december 31 2005 we recorded a plant asset of 26 million with offsetting accumulated depreciation of 14 million and an asset retirement obligation liability of 124 million we also recorded a cumulative effect amount related to utility operations as a reduction to a regulatory liability of 108 million and a cumulative effect charge against earnings of 3 million aftertax in 2005 

no liability has been recorded with respect to leadbased paint as the quantities of leadbased paint in our facilities are unknown in addition there is no incremental cost to demolitions of leadbased paint 

facilities vs nonlead based paint facilities and no regulations currently exist requiring any type of special disposal of items containing leadbased paint 

ludington hydroelectric power plant has an indeterminate life and no legal obligation currently exists to decommission the plant at some future date substations manholes and certain other distribution assets within detroit edison have an indeterminate life therefore no asset retirement liability has been recorded for these assets 

a reconciliation of the asset retirement obligations for 2006 follows 

 

a significant portion of the asset retirement obligations represents nuclear decommissioning liabilities which are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the life of the fermi 2 nuclear plant 

gas production 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for investments in gas properties under this method of accounting all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves the costs of drilling the well are expensed the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties on a propertybyproperty basis are considered not to be realizable an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved gas properties exceed the aggregate related undiscounted future net revenues depreciation depletion and amortization of proved gas properties are determined using the unitsofproduction method 

longlived assets 

our longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows generated by the asset an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

intangible assets 

we have certain intangible assets relating to nonutility contracts and emission allowances we amortize intangible assets on a straightline basis over the expected period of benefit ranging from 5 to 26 years intangible assets amortization expense was 5 million in 2006 2 million in 2005 and 1 million in 2004 the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at december 31 2006 were 80 million and 8 million respectively the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at december 31 2005 were 102 million and 3 million respectively amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be 5 million annually for 2007 through 2011 

excise and sales taxes 

we record the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing authority with no impact on the consolidated statement of operations 

deferred debt costs 

the costs related to the issuance of longterm debt are deferred and amortized over the life of each debt issue in accordance with mpsc regulations applicable to our electric and gas utilities the unamortized discount premium and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue discount premium and expense on early redemptions of debt associated with nonutility operations are charged to earnings 

insured and uninsured risks 

our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks our insurance policies cover risk of loss from property damage general liability workers’ compensation auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability under our risk management policy we selfinsure portions of certain risks up to specified limits depending on the type of exposure we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported liability prepared annually and adjust our reserves for selfinsured risks as appropriate 

investments in debt and equity securities 

we generally classify investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or availableforsale and have recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains or losses included in earnings or in other comprehensive income or loss respectively changes in the fair value of nuclear decommissioningrelated investments are recorded as adjustments to regulatory assets or liabilities our investments are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if the assessment indicates that the impairment is other than temporary a loss is recognized resulting in the investment being written down to its estimated fair value see note 7 

investment in plug power 

we own 88 million shares of plug power inc we account for our investment under the cost method of accounting we record our investment at market value and account for unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income or loss in december 2005 we contributed 18 million shares of plug power to the dte energy foundation that resulted in a gain of approximately 1 million due to related tax effects in may 2004 we sold 35 million shares of plug power stock and recorded a gain of approximately 14 million net of taxes 

consolidated statement of cash flows 

a detailed analysis of the changes in assets and liabilities that are reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows follows 

 

supplementary cash and noncash information for the years ended december 31 were as follows 

 

we entered into a margin loan facility with an affiliate of the clearing agent of a commodity exchange in lieu of posting additional cash collateral a noncash transaction the amount outstanding under the facility was 103 million as of december 31 2005 in october 2006 we changed our clearing agent and entered into a new demand financing agreement for up to 150 million the amount outstanding under this new agreement was 23 million at december 31 2006 see note 12 

in october 2006 we purchased the lessor interest in the 66 bcf washington 10 gas storage field prior to the purchase we leased the storage rights and lease obligations which were recorded as operating leases the acquisition resulted in a cash payment of approximately 13 million and the assumption of approximately 133 million of project related debt that was recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position see note 11 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net 

the following items are included in the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

see the following notes for other accounting policies impacting our financial statements 

 

note 2 – synfuel operations 

synthetic fuel operations 

we are the operator of nine synthetic fuel production facilities throughout the united states synfuel facilities chemically change coal including waste and marginal coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable internal revenue service rules production tax credits are provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuels produced from coal to qualify for the production tax credits the synthetic fuel must meet three primary conditions 1 there must be a significant chemical change in the coal feedstock 2 the product must be sold to an unaffiliated entity and 3 the production facility must have been placed in service before july 1 1998 through december 31 2006 we have generated and recorded approximately 580 million in production tax credits 

to reduce us dependence on imported oil the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels from alternative sources this incentive is not deemed necessary if the price of oil increases and provides significant market incentives for the production of these fuels as such the tax credit in a given year is reduced if the reference price of oil within that year exceeds a threshold price the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil we project the yearly average wellhead price per barrel 

of oil for the year to be approximately 6 lower than the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for light sweet crude oil the threshold price at which the credit begins to be reduced was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation for 2006 we estimate the threshold price at which the tax credit would begin to be reduced is 55 per barrel and would be completely phased out if the reference price reached 69 per barrel as of december 31 2006 the realized nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil was approximately 66 for 2006 equating to an estimated reference price of 60 which we estimate to be within the phaseout range 

to mitigate the effect of a potential phaseout and minimize operating losses we idled production at all nine of the synthetic fuel facilities that we operate on may 12 2006 the decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the level and volatility of oil prices at that time during the idle period we took various steps to reduce our oil price exposure including renegotiation of a significant number of commercial agreements beginning september 5 2006 through october 4 2006 we resumed production at each of the nine synfuel facilities due to these amended commercial agreements and declines in the level of oil prices 

gains losses from sale of interests in synthetic fuel facilities 

through december 2006 we have sold interests in all of the synthetic fuel production plants representing approximately 91 of our total production capacity proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels the production qualifying for production tax credits and the value of such credits production tax credits are subject to phaseout if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels we recognize gains from the sale of interests in the synfuel facilities as synfuel is produced and sold and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured until the gain recognition criteria are met gains from selling interests in synfuel facilities are deferred it is possible that gains will be deferred in the first second andor third quarters of each year until there is persuasive evidence that no tax credit phaseout will occur for the applicable calendar year this could result in shifting earnings from earlier quarters to later quarters of a calendar year we have recorded a pretax loss of 40 million in 2006 and pretax gains of 367 million and 219 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively from the sale of interests in synthetic fuel facilities net of reserves and impairments 

the gain from the sale of synfuel facilities is comprised of fixed and variable components the fixed component represents note payments is not subject to refund and is recognized as a gain when earned and collectibility is assured the variable component is based on an estimate of tax credits allocated to our partners and is subject to refund based on the annual oil price phaseout the variable component is recognized as a gain only when the probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is assured additionally our partners reimburse us through the project entity for the operating losses of the synfuel facilities referred to as capital contributions in the event that the tax credit is phased out we are contractually obligated to refund an amount equal to all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners to assess the probability and estimate the amount of refund we use valuation and analysis models that calculate the probability of the reference price of oil for the year being within or exceeding the phaseout range we recorded reserves for contractual partners’ obligations of 79 million in 2006 

derivative instruments  commodity price risk 

to manage our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could substantially reduce or eliminate synfuel sales proceeds we entered into a series of derivative contracts covering a specified number of barrels of oil the derivative contracts involve purchased and written call options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the full years’ average nymex trading prices for light sweet crude oil in relation to the strike prices of each option these contracts are based on various terms to take advantage of favorable oil price movements the agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting therefore the changes in the fair value of the options are recorded currently in earnings the fair value changes shown below are recorded as adjustments to the gain from selling interests in synfuel facilities and are included in the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line item in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

impairments and reserves 

in 2006 we determined that certain assets related to our synfuel operations were impaired the decision to record an impairment was based on the level and volatility of oil prices and the ability of the synfuel operations to generate production tax credits in 2006 we recorded a pretax loss of 157 million within the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line item in the consolidated statement of operations the loss consists of two components 78 million for synfuel related fixed asset impairment and inventory writedown and 79 million for a reserve for capital contributions related to operating losses we based the impairment decision on an analysis of the undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the assets and determined that the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their expected fair value the income impact of the fixed asset impairment and inventory writedown was partially offset by 70 million representing our partners’ share of the asset write down included in the minority interest line in the consolidated statement of operations 

guarantees 

we have provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in our synfuel facilities the guarantees cover potential commercial environmental oil price and taxrelated obligations and will survive until 90 days after expiration of all applicable statute of limitations we estimate that our maximum potential liability under these guarantees at december 31 2006 is 24 billion at december 31 2006 we have reserved 181 million of our maximum potential liability primarily representing the possible refund of certain payments made by our synfuel partners 

note 3 – new accounting pronouncements 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

in july 2006 the fasb issued financial interpretation no 48 fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 – accounting for income taxes fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 additionally it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we plan to adopt fin 48 effective january 1 2007 we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings 

fair value accounting 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements it emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we plan to adopt sfas 157 on january 1 2008 we are currently assessing the effects of this statement and have not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the fair value option established by sfas 159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates an entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument with a few exceptions such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments sfas 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we are currently assessing the effects of this statement and have not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements 

accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 requires companies to 1 recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and defined benefit other postretirement plans in its financial statements 2 recognize as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 3 recognize adjustments to other comprehensive income when the actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations are recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 4 measure postretirement benefit plan assets and plan obligations as of the date of the employer’s statement of financial position and 5 disclose additional information in the notes to financial statements about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost in the upcoming fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service cost and credits 

the requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit pension or defined benefit other postretirement plan and the related disclosure requirements was effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 and we adopted this portion of the standard on december 31 2006 we requested and received agreement from the mpsc to record the additional liability amounts for detroit edison and michcon on the balance sheet as a regulatory asset 

the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 the statement provides two options for the transition to a fiscal year end measurement date we currently use a november 30 measurement date we have not yet determined which of the available transition measurement options we will use 

see note 16 

accounting for planned major maintenance 

in september 2006 the fasb issued its staff position fsp aug air1 accounting for planned major maintenance activities this fsp prohibits the use of the accrueinadvance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods we have historically charged expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense as they were incurred with the exception of fermi 2 where we have utilized the accrueinadvance policy for nuclear refueling outage costs since the plant was placed in service in 1988 we adopted this fsp on december 31 2006 although this fsp prohibits use of the accrueinadvance method we will continue to use it to account for the cost of fermi 2 refueling outages because it matches the regulatory recovery of these costs in rates set by the mpsc and therefore is in compliance with the requirements of sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation the adoption of fsp aug air1 had no income impact on our financial statements see note 6 

quantifying misstatements 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab topic 1n financial statements — considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 108 sab 108 addresses how a registrant should quantify the effect of an error on the financial statements the sec staff concluded in sab 108 that a dual approach should be used to compute the amount of a misstatement specifically the amount should be computed using both the “rollover” current year income statement perspective and “iron curtain” yearend balance sheet perspective methods we adopted this sab effective december 31 2006 based on our assessment we identified no errors that would require an adjustment to current or prior financial statements therefore the adoption of sab 108 had no financial statement impact 

stock based compensation 

we adopted sfas no 123r share based payments effective january 1 2006 previously we had been following the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and followed the nominal vesting period approach for awards with retirement eligibility provisions see note 17 for the effects of the adoption of sfas no 123r 

note 4 – discontinued operations 

dte georgetown georgetown 

we own georgetown an 80 mw natural gasfired peaking electric generating plant in the fourth quarter of 2006 management approved the marketing of georgetown for sale in december 2006 georgetown met the sfas no 144 criteria of an asset “held for sale” and we reported its operating results as a discontinued operation we did not recognize an impairment loss since the net book value of georgetown’s assets less costs to sell approximated its fair value as of december 31 2006 georgetown’s assets are 23 million and its liabilities are 1 million in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell our georgetown peaking electric generating facility the sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2007

duty generation sales and service the systems monitoring business is planned to be retained by the company 

during the third quarter of 2005 the restructuring plan met criteria to classify the assets as “held for sale” accordingly we recognized a net of tax restructuring loss of 23 million during the third quarter of 2005 primarily representing the write down to fair value of the assets of dtech less costs to sell and the writeoff of goodwill of 16 million at december 31 2006 dtech had liabilities of 3 million

note 5 – other impairments and restructuring 

other impairments 

waste coal recovery 

in 2006 our power and industrial projects segment impaired its investment in proprietary technology used to refine waste coal the fixed assets at our development operation were impaired due to continued operating losses and negative cash flow in addition we impaired all our patents related to waste coal technology we calculated the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the assets which indicated that the carrying amount of the assets was not recoverable we determined the fair value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash flow technique through december 31 2006 we have recorded a pretax impairment loss of 19 million within the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line in the consolidated statement of operations 

landfill gas recovery 

in 2006 our power and industrial projects segment recorded a pretax impairment loss of 14 million at our landfill gas recovery unit relating to the writedown of assets at several landfill sites the fixed assets were impaired due to continued operating losses and the oil pricerelated phaseout of production tax credits the impairment was recorded within the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line in the consolidated statement of operations we calculated the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the assets which indicated that the carrying amount of certain assets was not recoverable we determined the fair value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 

nonutility power generation 

in 2006 our power and industrial projects segment recorded a pretax impairment loss totaling 74 million for its investments in two natural gasfired electric generating plants 

a loss of 42 million related to a 100 owned plant is recorded within the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line in the consolidated statement of operations the generating plant was impaired due to continued operating losses and the september 2006 delisting by miso resulting in the plant no longer providing capacity for the power grid we calculated the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the plant which indicated that the carrying amount of the plant was not recoverable we determined the fair value of the plant utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 

a loss of 32 million related to a 50 equity interest in a peaking gasfired electric generating plant is recorded within the other income and deductions other expenses line in the consolidated statement of operations the investment was impaired due to continued operating losses and the expected sale of the investment we determined the fair value of the plant utilizing a discounted cash flow technique which indicated that the carrying amount of the investment exceeded its fair value 

restructuring – performance excellence process 

in mid2005 we initiated a companywide review of our operations called the performance excellence process specifically we began a series of focused improvement initiatives within our electric and gas utilities and associated corporate support functions we expect this process will be carried out over a two to three year period beginning in 2005 

we have incurred cta for employee severance and other costs other costs include project management and consultant support pursuant to mpsc authorization in 2006 detroit edison deferred approximately 102 million of cta detroit edison will begin amortizing deferred 2006 costs in 2007 as the recovery of these costs was provided for by the mpsc michcon cannot defer cta costs at this time because a recovery mechanism has not been established see note 6 

amounts expensed are recorded in the operation and maintenance line on the consolidated statement of operations deferred amounts are recorded in the regulatory asset line on the consolidated statement of financial position expenses incurred in 2006 are as follows 

 

a liability for future cta associated with the performance excellence process has not been recognized because we have not met the recognition criteria of sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  

note 6 – regulatory matters 

regulation 

detroit edison and michcon are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison is also regulated by the ferc with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities 

as subsequently discussed in the “electric industry restructuring” section detroit edison’s rates were frozen through 2003 and capped for small business customers through 2004 and for residential customers through 2005 as a result of public act pa 141 however detroit edison was allowed to defer certain costs to be recovered once rates could be increased including costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes laws and other governmental actions 

regulatory assets and liabilities 

detroit edison and michcon apply the provisions of sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation to their regulated operations sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense in nonregulated businesses continued applicability of sfas no 71 requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and collected from customers future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the company discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of its utility businesses and may require the writeoff of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 71 to detroit edison and michcon 

the following are balances and a brief description of the regulatory assets and liabilities at december 31

electric rate restructuring proposal 

in february 2005 detroit edison filed a rate restructuring proposal with the mpsc to restructure its electric rates and begin phasing out subsidies within the current pricing structure in december 2005 the mpsc issued an order that did not provide for the comprehensive realignment of the existing rate structure that detroit edison requested in its rate restructuring proposal the mpsc order did take some initial steps to improve the current competitive imbalance in michigan’s electric customer choice program the december 2005 order established costbased power supply rates for detroit edison’s full service customers electric customer choice participants will pay costbased distribution rates while detroit edison’s full service commercial and industrial customers will pay costbased distribution rates that reflect the cost of the residential rate subsidy residential customers continue to pay a subsidized belowcost rate for distribution service these revenue neutral revised rates were effective february 1 2006 detroit edison was also ordered to file a general rate case by july 1 2007 based on 2006 actual results 

other postretirement benefits costs tracker 

in february 2005 detroit edison filed an application pursuant to the mpsc’s november 2004 final rate order requesting mpsc approval of a proposed tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs this mechanism would recognize differences between cost levels collected in rates and the actual costs under current accounting rules as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities with an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc in february 2006 the mpsc denied detroit edison’s request and ordered that this issue be addressed in the next general rate case due to be filed by july 1 2007 

mpsc showcause order 

in march 2006 the mpsc issued an order directing detroit edison to show cause by june 1 2006 why its retail electric rates should not be reduced in 2007 the mpsc cited certain changes that had occurred since the november 2004 order in detroit edison’s last general rate case or were expected to occur these changes included declines in electric customer choice program participation expiration of the residential rate caps and projected reductions in detroit edison operating costs the show cause filing was to reflect sales costs and financial conditions that were expected to occur by 2007 on june 1 2006 detroit edison filed its response explaining why its electric rates should not be reduced in 2007 detroit edison indicated that it will have a revenue deficiency of approximately 45 million beginning in 2007 due to significant capital investments over the next several years for infrastructure improvements to enhance electric service reliability and for mandated environmental expenditures the impacts of these investments will be partially offset by efficiency and costsavings measures that have been initiated therefore detroit edison requested that the show cause proceeding allow for rate increase adjustments based on the combined effects of investment expenditures and costsavings programs the mpsc denied this request and indicated that a full review of rates will be made in detroit edison’s next general rate case which is due to be filed by july 1 2007 

the mpsc issued an order approving a settlement agreement in this proceeding on august 31 2006 the order provided for an annualized rate reduction of 53 million for 2006 effective september 5 2006 beginning january 1 2007 and continuing until the later of march 31 2008 or 12 months from the filing date of detroit edison’s next general rate case rates will be reduced by an additional 26 million for a 

total reduction of 79 million the revenue reduction is net of the recovery of the amortization of the costs associated with the implementation of the performance excellence process the settlement agreement provides for some level of realignment of the existing rate structure by allocating a larger percentage share of the rate reduction to the commercial and industrial customer classes than to the residential customer classes 

as part of the settlement agreement a choice incentive mechanism cim was established with a base level of electric choice sales set at 3400 gwh the cim prescribes regulatory treatment of changes in nonfuel revenue attributed to increases or decreases in electric customer choice sales the cim has a deadband of ±200 gwh if electric customer choice sales exceed 3600 gwh detroit edison will be able to recover 90 of its reduction in nonfuel revenue from full service customers up to 71 million if electric customer choice sales fall below 3200 gwh detroit edison will credit 100 of the increase in nonfuel revenue to the unrecovered regulatory asset recovery balances 

regulatory accounting treatment for performance excellence process 

in may 2006 detroit edison and michcon filed applications with the mpsc to allow deferral of costs associated with the implementation of the performance excellence process a companywide costsavings and performance improvement program implementation costs include project management consultant support and employee severance expenses detroit edison and michcon sought mpsc authorization to defer and amortize performance excellence process implementation costs for accounting purposes to match the expected savings from the performance excellence process program with the related cta detroit edison and michcon anticipate that the performance excellence process will be carried out over a two to three year period beginning in 2006 detroit edison’s cta is estimated to total between 160 million and 190 million michcon’s cta is estimated to total between 55 million and 60 million in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order approving a settlement agreement that allows detroit edison and michcon commencing in 2006 to defer the incremental cta further the order provides for detroit edison and michcon to amortize the cta deferrals over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the cta was deferred detroit edison recorded the deferred cta costs of 102 million as a regulatory asset and will begin amortizing deferred 2006 costs in 2007 as the recovery of these costs was provided for by the mpsc in the order approving the settlement in the show cause proceeding michcon cannot defer cta costs at this time because a recovery mechanism has not been established 

electric industry restructuring 

in 2000 the michigan legislature enacted pa 141 that reduced electric retail rates by 5 as a result of savings derived from the issuance of securitization bonds the legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing rate increases ie rate caps for small business customers through 2004 and for residential customers through 2005 the price freeze period expired on february 20 2004 pursuant to an mpsc order in addition pa 141 codified the mpsc’s existing electric customer choice program and provided detroit edison with the right to recover net stranded costs associated with electric customer choice detroit edison was also allowed to defer certain costs to be recovered once rates could be increased including costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes laws and other governmental actions 

as required by pa 141 the mpsc conducted a proceeding to develop a methodology for calculating net stranded costs associated with electric customer choice in a december 2001 order the mpsc determined that detroit edison could recover net stranded costs associated with the fixed cost component of its electric generation operations specifically there would be an annual proceeding or trueup before the mpsc reconciling the receipt of revenues associated with the fixed cost component of its generation services to the revenue requirement for the fixed cost component of those services inclusive of an allowance for the cost of capital any resulting shortfall in recovery net of mitigation would be 

considered a net stranded cost the mpsc authorized detroit edison to establish a regulatory asset to defer recovery of its incurred stranded costs subject to review in a subsequent annual net stranded cost proceeding 

2004 pscr reconciliation and 2004 net stranded cost case 

in accordance with the mpsc’s directive in detroit edison’s november 2004 rate order in march 2005 detroit edison filed a joint application and testimony in its 2004 pscr reconciliation case and its 2004 net stranded cost recovery case in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order recognizing 19 million of 2004 net stranded costs that required detroit edison to write off 112 million of 2004 net stranded costs the mpsc order resulted in a 39 million reduction in the 2004 pscr overcollection by allowing detroit edison to retain the benefit of third party wholesale sales required to support the electric customer choice program and to offset the recognition of the 19 million of 2004 stranded costs the mpsc order also resulted in reductions to accrued interest on the 2004 and 2005 pscr amounts of 15 million the mpsc directed detroit edison to include the remaining 2004 pscr overcollection amount and related interest in the 2005 pscr reconciliation which is in an undercollected position the order resulted in a reduction of pretax income of approximately 58 million

securitization 

detroit edison formed the detroit edison securitization funding llc securitization llc a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of securitizing its qualified costs primarily related to the unamortized investment in the fermi 2 nuclear power plant in march 2001 the securitization llc issued 175 billion of securitization bonds and detroit edison sold 175 billion of qualified costs to the securitization llc the securitization llc is independent of detroit edison as is its ownership of the qualified costs due to principles of consolidation the qualified costs and securitization bonds appear on our consolidated statement of financial position we make no claim to these assets ownership of such assets has vested in the securitization llc and been assigned to the trustee for the securitization bonds neither the qualified costs nor funds from an mpsc approved nonbypassable surcharge collected from detroit edison’s customers for the payment of costs related to the securitization llc and securitization bonds are available to detroit edison’s creditors 

accounting for costs related to enterprise business systems ebs 

in july 2004 detroit edison filed an accounting application with the mpsc requesting authority to capitalize and amortize costs related to ebs consisting of computer equipment software and development costs as well as related training maintenance and overhead costs in april 2005 the mpsc approved a settlement agreement providing for the deferral of up to 60 million of certain ebs costs that would otherwise be expensed as a regulatory asset for future rate recovery starting january 1 2006 at december 31 2006 approximately 9 million of ebs costs have been deferred as a regulatory asset in addition ebs costs recorded as plant assets will be amortized over a 15year period pursuant to mpsc authorization 

power supply costs recovery proceedings 

2005 plan year – in september 2004 detroit edison filed its 2005 pscr plan case seeking approval of a levelized pscr factor of 182 mills per kwh above the amount included in base rates in december 2004 detroit edison filed revisions to its 2005 pscr plan case in accordance with the november 2004 mpsc rate order the revised filing seeks approval of a levelized pscr factor of up to 048 mills per kwh above the new base rates established in the final electric rate order included in the factor were power supply costs transmission expenses and nitrogen oxide nox emission allowance costs detroit edison selfimplemented a factor of negative 200 mills per kwh on january 1 2005 effective june 1 2005 detroit edison began billing the maximum allowable factor of 048 mills per kwh due to increased power supply costs in september 2005 the mpsc approved detroit edison’s 2005 pscr plan case at december 31 2005 detroit edison has recorded an underrecovery of approximately 144 million 

related to the 2005 plan year in march 2006 detroit edison filed its 2005 pscr reconciliation the filing sought approval for recovery of approximately 144 million from its commercial and industrial customers the filing included a motion for entry of an order to implement immediately a reconciliation surcharge of 496 mills per kwh on the bills of its commercial and industrial customers the undercollected pscr expense allocated to residential customers could not be recovered due to the pa 141 rate cap for residential customers which expired january 1 2006 in addition to the 2005 pscr plan year reconciliation the filing included a reconciliation for the pension equalization mechanism pem for the periods from november 24 2004 through december 31 2004 and from january 1 2005 through december 31 2005 the pem reconciliation seeks to allocate and refund approximately 12 million to customers based upon their contributions to pension expense during the subject periods the september 2006 order in the company’s 2004 pscr reconciliation and stranded cost proceeding directed the company to roll the entire 2004 pscr overcollection amount to the company’s 2005 pscr reconciliation thereby reducing the company’s 2005 pscr reconciliation undercollection amount for commercial and industrial customers to 64 million an order is expected in the first half of 2007 

2006 plan year — in september 2005 detroit edison filed its 2006 pscr plan case seeking approval of a levelized pscr factor of 499 mills per kwh above the amount included in base rates for residential customers and 829 per kwh above the amount included in base rates for commercial and industrial customers included in the factor for all customers are fuel and power supply costs including transmission expenses midwest independent transmission system operator miso market participation costs and nox emission allowance costs the company’s pscr plan includes a matrix which provides for different maximum pscr factors contingent on varying electric customer choice sales levels the plan also includes 97 million for recovery of its projected 2005 pscr undercollection associated with commercial and industrial customers additionally the pscr plan requests mpsc approval of expense associated with sulfur dioxide emission allowances mercury emission allowances and a fuel additive in conjunction with dte energy’s sale of its transmission assets to itc transmission in february 2003 the ferc froze itc transmission’s rates through december 2004 in approving the sale ferc authorized itc transmission’s recovery of the difference between the revenue it would have collected and the actual revenue collected during the rate freeze period this amount is estimated to be 66 million which is to be included in itc transmission’s rates over a fiveyear period beginning june 1 2006 this increased detroit edison’s transmission expense in 2006 by approximately 7 million the mpsc authorized detroit edison in 2004 to recover transmission expenses through the pscr mechanism 

in december 2005 the mpsc issued a temporary order authorizing the company to begin implementation of maximum quarterly pscr factors on january 1 2006 the quarterly factors reflect a downward adjustment in the company’s total power supply costs of approximately 2 to reflect the potential variability in cost projections the quarterly factors will allow the company to more closely track the costs of providing electric service to our customers and because the nonsummer factors are well below those ordered for the summer months effectively delay the higher power supply costs to the summer months at which time our customers will not be experiencing large expenditures for home heating the mpsc did not adopt the company’s request to recover its projected 2005 pscr undercollection associated with commercial and industrial customers nor did it adopt the company’s request to implement contingency factors based upon the company’s increased costs associated with providing electric service to returning electric customer choice customers the mpsc deferred both of those company proposals to the final order on the company’s entire 2006 pscr plan in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order in this case that approved the inclusion of sulfur dioxide emission allowance expense in the pscr determined that fuel additive expense should not be included in the pscr based upon its impact on maintenance expense found the company’s determination of third party sales revenues to be correct and allowed the company to increase its pscr factor for the balance of the year in an effort to reverse the effects of the previously ordered temporary reduction the mpsc declined to rule on the company’s requests to include mercury emission allowance expense in the pscr or its request to include prior pscr overunder recoveries in future year pscr plans we have filed a petition for rehearing in december 2006 detroit edison was granted its request to include its updated projection 81 

million of its 2006 pscr undercollection in its 2007 pscr plan in addition detroit edison was granted the authority to include all pscr over under collections in future pscr plans thereby reducing the time between refund or recovery of pscr reconciliation amounts

gas rate case 

on april 28 2005 the mpsc issued an order for final rate relief the mpsc determined that the base rate increase granted to michcon should be 61 million annually effective april 29 2005 this amount is an increase of 26 million over the 35 million in interim rate relief approved in september 2004 the rate increase was based on a 50 debt and 50 equity capital structure and an 11 rate of return on common equity 

the mpsc adopted michcon’s proposed tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable each year michcon will file an application comparing its actual uncollectible expense to its designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million ninety percent of the difference will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc the mpsc also approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of the negative pension expense michcon will record a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles included as part of the base rate increase the order provided for 25 million in rates to recover safety and training costs there is a oneway tracking mechanism that provides for refunding the portion of the 25 million not expended on an annual basis 

the mpsc order reduced michcon’s depreciation rates and the related revenue requirement associated with depreciation expense by 145 million and is designed to have no impact on net income 

the mpsc did not allow the recovery of approximately 25 million of merger interest costs allocated to michcon that were incurred by dte energy as a result of the acquisition of mcn energy 

the mpsc order also resulted in the disallowance of computer system and equipment costs and adjustments to environmental regulatory assets and liabilities the mpsc disallowed recovery of ninety percent of the costs of a computer billing system that was in place prior to dte energy’s acquisition of mcn energy in 2001 as a result of the order michcon recognized an impairment of this asset of approximately 42 million in the first quarter of 2005 this impairment had a minimal impact on dte energy because a valuation allowance was established for this asset at the time of the mcn acquisition in 2001 the mpsc disallowed approximately 6 million of certain computer equipment and related depreciation and the recovery of certain internal labor and legal costs related to remediation of mgp sites of approximately 6 million the mpsc ordered an additional 5 million charge due to a change in the allocation of historical mgp sites insurance proceeds 

uncollectible expense tracker mechanism and report of safety and trainingrelated expenditures 

in march 2006 michcon filed an application with the mpsc for approval of its uncollectible expense tracking mechanism for 2005 this is the first filing michcon has made under the uncollectible tracking mechanism which was approved by the mpsc in april 2005 as part of michcon’s last general rate case michcon’s 2005 base rates included 37 million for anticipated uncollectible expenses actual 2005 uncollectible expenses totaled 60 million the tracker mechanism allows michcon to recover ninety percent of uncollectibles that exceeded that 37 million base under the formula prescribed by the mpsc michcon recorded an underrecovery of approximately 11 million for uncollectible expenses from may 2005 when the mechanism took effect through the end of 2005 in december 2006 the mpsc issued an order authorizing michcon to implement the uncollectible expense trueup mechanism uetm monthly surcharge for service rendered on and after january 1 2007 as part of the march 2006 application with the mpsc michcon filed a review of the 2005 annual safety and training  related expenditures michcon reported that actual safety and trainingrelated expenditures for the initial period exceeded the prorata amounts included in base rates and based on the underrecovered position recommended no refund at this time in the december 2006 order the mpsc also approved michcon’s 2005 safety and training report as of december 31 2006 michcon is in a 3 million overrecovery position for safety and training costs 

gas cost recovery proceedings 

2004 plan year  in september 2003 michcon filed its 2004 gcr plan case proposing a maximum gcr factor of 536 per mcf michcon agreed to switch from a calendar year to an operational year as a condition of its settlement in the 2003 gcr plan case the operational gcr year runs from april to march of the following year to accomplish the switch the 2004 gcr plan reflected a 15month transitional period january 2004 through march 2005 under this transition proposal michcon filed two reconciliations pertaining to the transition period one in june 2004 addressing january through march 2004 one filed in june 2005 addressing the remaining april 2004 through march 2005 period and consolidating the two for purposes of the case the june 2005 filing supported the 46 million underrecovery with interest michcon had accrued for the period ending march 31 2005 in march 2006 mpsc staff filed testimony recommending an adjustment to the accounting treatment of the injected base gas remaining in the new haven storage field when it was sold in early 2004 that would result in a 3 million reduction to michcon’s accrued underrecovery in june 2006 an mpsc administrative law judge alj issued a proposal for decision pfd recommending an approximately 43 million underrecovery michcon recorded the 3 million reduction to the 2004 underrecovery in the second quarter of 2006 the mpsc issued an order in august 2006 authorizing michcon to roll a 42 million net underrecovery including interest into its 2005 – 2006 gcr reconciliation this order disallowed 03 million related to the sale of storage services and concurrent reduction in gas purchases in february and march of 2005 the mpsc also found that the staff’s proposed accounting for the sale of the new haven injected base gas was appropriate 

20052006 plan year  in december 2004 michcon filed its 20052006 gcr plan case proposing a maximum gcr factor of 799 per mcf the plan includes quarterly contingent gcr factors these contingent factors allow michcon to increase the maximum gcr factor to compensate for increases in gas market prices thereby reducing the possibility of a gcr underrecovery in april 2005 the mpsc issued an order recognizing that michigan law allows michcon to selfimplement its quarterly contingent factors michcon selfimplemented quarterly contingent gcr factors of 854 per mcf in july 2005 and 1009 per mcf in october 2005 in response to market price increases in the fall of 2005 michcon filed a petition to reopen the record in the case during september 2005 michcon proposed a revised maximum gcr factor of 1310 per mcf and a revised contingent factor matrix in october 2005 the mpsc approved an increase in the gcr factor to a cap of 113851 per mcf for the period november 2005 through march 2006 in june 2006 michcon filed its gcr reconciliation for the 20052006 gcr year the filing supported a total overrecovery including interest through march 2006 of 13 million mpsc staff and other interveners filed testimony regarding the reconciliation in december 2006 in which they recommended disallowances related to michcon’s implementation of its dollar cost averaging fixed price program and its use of fixed basis in contracting purchases in january 2007 michcon filed testimony rebutting these recommendations the 20052006 gcr plan case is in the early stages of the regulatory review and approval process and the final resolution is uncertain based on available information michcon is unable to assess the range of a reasonably possible loss related to the proposed disallowances an mpsc order is expected in 2007 

20062007 plan year – in december 2005 michcon filed its 20062007 gcr plan case proposing a maximum gcr factor of 1215 per mcf in july 2006 michcon and the parties to the case reached a settlement agreement that provides for a maximum gcr factor of 895 per mcf plus quarterly contingent gcr factors these contingent factors will allow michcon to increase the maximum gcr factor to compensate for increases in gas market prices thereby reducing the possibility of a gcr underrecovery the mpsc issued an order approving the settlement in august 2006 

20072008 plan year  native base gas sale consolidated – in august 2006 michcon filed an application with the mpsc requesting permission to sell native base gas that would become accessible with storage facilities upgrades michcon estimated sale of this base gas would be worth 34 million in december 2006 the administrative law judge in the case approved a motion made by the residential ratepayer consortium to consolidate this case with michcon’s 20072008 gcr plan case in december 2006 michcon filed its 20072008 gcr plan case proposing a maximum gcr factor of 849 per mcf an mpsc order in the consolidated cases is expected by the end of 2007 

minimum pension liability 

at december 31 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans to recognize the obligations of its pension and postretirement plans based on approval received from the mpsc detroit edison recorded the charge to a miscellaneous deferred debit included in regulatory assets in the consolidated statement of financial position 

other 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the regulatory matters discussed herein resolution of these matters is dependent upon future mpsc orders and appeals which may materially impact the financial position results of operations and cash flows of the company 

note 7 – nuclear operations 

general 

fermi 2 our nuclear generating plant began commercial operation in 1988 fermi 2 has a design electrical rating net of 1150 megawatts this plant represents approximately 10 of detroit edison’s summer net rated capability the net book balance of the fermi 2 plant was written off at december 31 1998 and an equivalent regulatory asset was established in 2001 the fermi 2 regulatory asset was securitized see note 6 detroit edison also owns fermi 1 a nuclear plant that was shut down in 1972 and is currently being decommissioned the nrc has jurisdiction over the licensing and operation of fermi 2 and the decommissioning of fermi 1 

property insurance 

detroit edison maintains several different types of property insurance policies specifically for the fermi 2 plant these policies cover such items as replacement power and property damage the nuclear electric insurance limited neil is the primary supplier of the insurance polices 

detroit edison maintains a policy for extra expenses including replacement power costs necessitated by fermi 2’s unavailability due to an insured event these policies have a 12week waiting period and provide an aggregate 490 million of coverage over a threeyear period 

detroit edison has 500 million in primary coverage and 225 billion of excess coverage for stabilization decontamination debris removal repair andor replacement of property and decommissioning the combined coverage limit for total property damage is 275 billion 

for multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 tria occurring within one year after the first loss from terrorism the neil policies would make available to all insured entities up to 32 billion plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance government indemnity or other sources to cover losses 

under the neil policies detroit edison could be liable for maximum assessments of up to approximately 29 million per event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant in the united states should exceed the accumulated funds available to neil 

public liability insurance 

as required by federal law detroit edison maintains 300 million of public liability insurance for a nuclear incident for liabilities arising from a terrorist act outside the scope of tria the policy is subject to one industry aggregate limit of 300 million further under the priceanderson amendments act of 2005 deferred premium charges up to 101 million could be levied against each licensed nuclear facility but not more than 15 million per year per facility thus deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities 

decommissioning 

detroit edison has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating licenses this obligation is reflected as an asset retirement obligation which is classified as a noncurrent regulatory liability based on the actual or anticipated extended life of the nuclear plant decommissioning expenditures for fermi 2 are expected to be incurred primarily during the period 2025 through 2050 it is estimated that the cost of decommissioning fermi 2 when its license expires in 2025 will be 12 billion in 2006 dollars and 34 billion in 2025 dollars using a 6 inflation rate in 2001 detroit edison began the decommissioning of fermi 1 with the goal of removing the radioactive material and terminating the fermi 1 license the decommissioning of fermi 1 is expected to be complete by 2010 

detroit edison currently recovers funds for fermi 2 decommissioning and the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste through a revenue surcharge the decommissioning of fermi 1 is funded by detroit edison the amounts recovered from customers are deposited in the restricted external trust accounts to fund decommissioning 

 

the nuclear decommissioning cost will be funded by investments held in trust funds that have been established for each nuclear station as follows 

 

at december 31 2006 investments in the external nuclear decommissioning trust funds consisted of approximately 50 in publicly traded equity securities 43 in fixed debt instruments and 7 in cash equivalents 

the nrc has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires decommissioning funding based upon a formula the mpsc and ferc regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of fermi 2 rates approved by the mpsc provide for the recovery of decommissioning costs of fermi 2 detroit edison is continuing to fund ferc jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in ferc rates we believe the mpsc and ferc collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the nrc formula the decommissioning assets anticipated earnings thereon and future revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to decommission the nuclear facilities we expect the regulatory liabilities to be reduced to zero at the conclusion of the decommissioning activities if amounts remain in the trust funds for these units following the completion of the decommissioning activities those amounts will be returned to the ratepayers 

a portion of funds recovered through the fermi 2 decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust accounts is designated for the removal of nonradioactive assets and the cleanup of the fermi site this removal and cleanup is not considered a legal liability therefore it is not included in the asset retirement obligation but is included in the nuclear decommissioning regulatory liability 

nuclear fuel disposal costs 

in accordance with the federal nuclear waste policy act of 1982 detroit edison has a contract with the us department of energy doe for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from fermi 2 detroit edison is obligated to pay the doe a fee of 1 mill per kwh of fermi 2 electricity generated and sold the fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense delays have occurred in the doe’s program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository until the doe is able to fulfill its obligation under the contract detroit edison is responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage detroit edison is currently expanding the fermi 2 spent fuel pool capacity to meet our storage requirements through 2009 detroit edison is a party in the litigation against the doe for both past and future costs associated with the doe’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the federal nuclear waste policy act of 1982 

note 8 — jointly owned utility plant 

detroit edison has joint ownership interest in two power plants belle river and ludington hydroelectric pumped storage ownership information of the two utility plants as of december 31 2006 was as follows 

 

 

 belle river 

the michigan public power agency mppa has an ownership interest in belle river unit no 1 and other related facilities the mppa is entitled to 19 of the total capacity and energy of the plant and is responsible for the same percentage of the plant’s operation maintenance and capital improvement costs 

ludington hydroelectric pumped storage 

consumers energy company has an ownership interest in the ludington hydroelectric pumped storage plant consumers energy is entitled to 51 of the total capacity and energy of the plant and is responsible for the same percentage of the plant’s operation maintenance and capital improvement costs 

note 9  income taxes 

we file a consolidated federal income tax return total income tax expense varied from the statutory federal income tax rate for the following reasons 

 

the minority interest allocation reflects the adjustment to earnings to allocate partnership losses to third party owners the tax impact of partnership earnings and losses are attributable to the partners instead of the partnerships the minority interest allocation is therefore removed in computing income taxes associated with continuing operations 

components of income tax expense were as follows 

 

production tax credits are provided for qualified fuels produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party during the taxable year production tax credits earned but not utilized totaled 438 million and are carried forward indefinitely as alternative minimum tax credits the majority of the production tax credits earned including all of those from our synfuel projects were generated from projects that have received a private letter ruling plr from the internal revenue service irs these plrs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of using these credits to offset taxable income however these tax credits are subject to irs audit and adjustment 

we have a net operating loss carryforward of 90 million that expires in 2020 we do not believe that a valuation allowance is required as we expect to utilize the loss carryforward prior to its expiration 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent according to the classification of the related assets or liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary differences 

deferred tax assets liabilities were comprised of the following at december 31 

 

the above table excludes deferred tax liabilities associated with unamortized investment tax credits which are shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position 

in january 2007 we signed an agreement with the irs acknowledging our acceptance of the results of the 2002 and 2003 audits of our federal income tax returns we accrue tax and interest related to tax 

uncertainties that arise due to actual or potential disagreements with governmental agencies about the tax treatment of specific items at december 31 2006 the company had accrued approximately 32 million for such uncertainties we believe that our accrued tax liabilities are adequate for all years see note 3 for information regarding the planned january 1 2007 adoption of fin 48 

note 10 – common stock and earnings per share 

common stock 

in december 2006 we repurchased one million shares of dte energy common stock for approximately 485 million 

in august 2005 we successfully remarketed the senior notes comprising part of our equity security units that were issued in june 2002 we also settled the stock purchase contract component of the equity security units by issuing 37 million shares of common stock to holders of these units in august 2005 at an issue price of 4679 the issue price was calculated by using the average closing price per share of our common stock during a 20 tradingday period ending august 11 2005 

in march 2004 we issued 4344492 shares of dte energy common stock valued at 170 million the common stock was contributed to a defined benefit retirement plan 

under the dte energy company longterm incentive plan we grant nonvested stock awards to key employees primarily management as a result of a stock award a settlement of an award of performance shares or by exercise of a participant’s stock option we may deliver common stock from the company’s authorized but unissued common stock andor from outstanding common stock acquired by or on behalf of the company in the name of the participant the number of nonvested restricted stock awards is included in the number of common shares outstanding however for purposes of computing basic earnings per share nonvested restricted stock awards are excluded 

shareholders’ rights agreement 

we have a shareholders’ rights agreement designed to maximize shareholder value should dte energy be acquired under certain triggering events each right entitles the holder to purchase from dte energy one onehundredth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock of dte energy at a price of 90 subject to adjustment as provided for in the shareholders’ rights agreement the rights expire in october 2007 

earnings per share 

we report both basic and diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share assumes the issuance of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and the repurchase of common shares that would have occurred with proceeds from the assumed issuance diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of stock options 

a reconciliation of both calculations is presented in the following table 

 

options to purchase approximately 100000 shares of common stock in 2006  two million shares of common stock in 2005 and one million shares in 2004 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares thus making these options antidilutive 

note 11 — longterm debt and preferred securities 

longterm debt 

our longterm debt outstanding and weighted average interest rates1 of debt outstanding at december 31 were 

 

 

 110 

debt issuances 

in 2006 we issued the following longterm debt 

 

 

 in october 2006 we purchased the lessor interest in the 66 bcf washington 10 gas storage field prior to the purchase we leased the storage rights and lease obligations which were recorded as operating leases the acquisition resulted in a cash payment of approximately 13 million and the assumption of approximately 133 million of project related debt that was recorded on our statement of financial position 

debt retirements and redemptions 

the following debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2006 

 

 

 the following table shows the scheduled debt maturities excluding any unamortized discount or premium on debt 

 

remarketable securities 

at december 31 2006 75 million of notes of michcon were subject to periodic remarketings we do not expect any remarketings to take place in 2007 we direct the remarketing agents to remarket these securities at the lowest interest rate necessary to produce a par bid in the event that a remarketing fails we would be required to purchase the securities 

equitylinked securities 

in june 2002 dte energy issued 173 million of 875 equity security units with each unit consisting of a stock purchase contract and a senior note of dte energy in august 2005 dte energy successfully remarketed 172 million aggregate principal amount of its 563 senior notes due august 16 2007 that were originally issued as a component of the 875 equity security units additionally in august 2005 dte energy settled the stock purchase contract component of its equity security units by issuing common stock to holders of these units the issue price determined by the average closing price per share of our common stock during a 20 tradingday period ending august 11 2005 was 4679 per share settlement of the purchase contracts resulted in dte energy issuing approximately 37 million shares of common stock in exchange for approximately 172 million 

trust preferredlinked securities 

dte energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that were formed for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the gross proceeds to us the sole assets of the trusts are debt securities of dte energy with terms similar to those of the related preferred securities payments we make are used by the trusts to make cash distributions on the preferred securities it has issued 

we have the right to extend interest payment periods on the debt securities should we exercise this right we cannot declare or pay dividends on or redeem purchase or acquire any of our capital stock during the deferral period 

dte energy has issued certain guarantees with respect to payments on the preferred securities these guarantees when taken together with our obligations under the debt securities and related indenture provide full and unconditional guarantees of the trusts’ obligations under the preferred securities 

financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred by dte energy these costs are being amortized using the straightline method over the estimated lives of the related securities 

cross default provisions 

substantially all of the net utility properties of detroit edison and michcon are subject to the lien of mortgages should detroit edison or michcon fail to timely pay their indebtedness under these mortgages such failure may create cross defaults in the indebtedness of dte energy 

preferred and preference securities  authorized and unissued 

as of december 31 2006 the amount of authorized and unissued stock is as follows

note 12  shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings 

dte energy and its whollyowned subsidiaries detroit edison and michcon have entered into revolving credit facilities with similar terms the fiveyear credit facilities are with a syndicate of banks and may be used for general corporate borrowings but are intended to provide liquidity support for each of the companies’ commercial paper programs 

in october 2005 dte energy detroit edison and michcon entered into fiveyear revolving credit agreements with an aggregate capacity of 925 million simultaneously we amended the october 2004 975 million fiveyear revolving credit facilities to provide for the substitution of some of the participating lenders as well as modifications to pricing conditions to borrowing covenants events of default and other miscellaneous provisions to conform to the terms of the new agreements 

the aggregate availability under these combined facilities is 19 billion as shown in the following table 

 

borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing shortterm interest rates the agreements require us to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 65 to l should we have delinquent debt obligations of at least 50 million to any creditor such delinquency will be considered a default under our credit agreements at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively we had approximately 123 million and 284 million of letters of credit outstanding against these facilities 

effective december 31 2006 the credit agreements were amended to among other things exclude michcon’s shortterm debt from the debtcapital ratio in the first third and fourth quarter reporting periods exclude the effects of sfas no 158 in the compliance calculation and exclude undrawn letters of credit and guarantees except for guaranteed debt of nonconsolidated third parties from the debt calculations under these credit agreements

calculation and exclude undrawn letters of credit and guarantees except for guaranteed debt of nonconsolidated third parties from the debt calculations under these credit agreements 

in conjunction with maintaining certain exchange traded risk management positions we may be required to post cash collateral with our clearing agent we entered into a margin loan facility with an affiliate of the clearing agent of up to 103 million as of december 31 2005 in lieu of posting cash this arrangement was backed by a letter of credit issued by dte energy in the amount of 100 million the amount outstanding under this facility was 103 million as of december 31 2005 in october 2006 we changed our clearing agent and entered into a new demand financing agreement for up to 150 million the amount outstanding under this new agreement was 23 million at december 31 2006

note 14 – financial and other derivative instruments 

we comply with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended listed below are important sfas no 133 requirements 

 

 

 

 

our primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices credit interest rates and foreign currency we have risk management policies to monitor and decrease market risks we use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure except for the activities of the energy trading segment we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes the fair value of all derivatives is included in “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” on the consolidated statement of financial position 

commodity price risk 

utility operations 

detroit edison – detroit edison generates purchases distributes and sells electricity detroit edison uses forward energy capacity and futures contracts to manage changes in the price of electricity and fuel these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges or meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 

and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method there were no commodity price risk cash flow hedges for electric utility operations at december 31 2006 

michcon – michcon purchases stores transmits and distributes natural gas and sells storage and transportation capacity michcon has fixedpriced contracts for portions of its expected gas supply requirements through 2010 michcon may also sell forward storage and transportation capacity contracts these gas supply firm transportation and storage contracts are designated and qualify for the normal purchases and sales exemption and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method 

nonutility operations 

power and industrial projects – these business segments manage and operate onsite energy and steel related projects landfill gas recovery and power generation assets these businesses utilize fixedpriced contracts in their marketing and management of their assets these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method 

synthetic fuel – businesses generate production tax credits we have sold interests in all nine of our synthetic fuel production plants proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels the production qualifying for production tax credits and the value of such credits production tax credits are subject to phase out if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels see note 2 

to manage our exposure in 2007 to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce or eliminate synfuel sales proceeds we entered into a series of derivative contracts covering a specified number of barrels of oil the derivative contracts involve purchased and written call options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the full years 2007 average new york mercantile exchange nymex trading prices for light sweet crude oil in relation to the strike prices of each option if the average nymex prices of oil in 2007 are less than 60 per barrel then the derivatives will yield no payment if the price per barrel begins to exceed the base 60 per barrel figure then the derivatives will begin to yield a payment these agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting consequently changes in the fair value of the options are recorded currently in earnings the fair value changes are recorded as adjustments to the gain from selling interests in synfuel facilities and therefore included in the “asset gains and losses net” item line on the consolidated statement of operations 

unconventional gas production – our unconventional gas business is engaged in natural gas exploration development and production we use derivative contracts to manage changes in the price of natural gas these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to earnings specifically as a component of operating revenues as the related production affects earnings through 2013 in 2006 and 2005 86 million and 35 million respectively of aftertax losses were reclassified to earnings in 2007 we estimate reclassifying an aftertax loss of approximately 28 million to earnings 

energy trading – energy trading markets and trades wholesale electricity and natural gas physical products energy financial instruments and provides risk management services utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments forwards futures options and swap agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations on its operations these derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings specifically as a component of operating revenues unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met this fair value accounting better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is managed and its performance measured energy trading experiences earnings volatility as a result of its gas inventory and other nonderivative assets that do not qualify for fair value accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the us although the risks associated with these asset positions are substantially offset requirements to fair value the related derivatives result in unrealized gains and losses being recorded to earnings that eventually reverse upon settlement for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings specifically as a component of operating revenues as the related forecasted transaction affects earnings through 2008 in 2007 we estimate reclassifying an aftertax loss of approximately 7 million to earnings 

coal and gas midstream – these business units are primarily engaged in services related to marketing and transportation of coal as well as the transportation processing and storage of natural gas these 

businesses utilize fixedpriced contracts in their marketing and management of their businesses these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method 

credit risk 

our utility and nonutility businesses are exposed to credit risk if customers or counterparties do not comply with their contractual obligations we maintain credit policies that significantly minimize overall credit risk these policies include an evaluation of potential customers’ and counterparties’ financial condition credit rating collateral requirements or other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees we generally use standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty 

interest rate risk 

we use interest rate swaps treasury locks and other derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rate market volatility in 2004 and 2000 we entered into a series of interest rate derivatives to limit our sensitivity to market interest rate risk associated with the issuance of longterm debt such instruments were designated as cash flow hedges we subsequently issued longterm debt and terminated these hedges at a cost that is included in other comprehensive loss amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense as the related interest affects earnings through 2030 in 2007 we estimate reclassifying 4 million of losses to earnings 

foreign currency risk 

dte energy trading has foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fixed canadian dollar commitments existing under power purchase and sale contracts and gas transportation contracts we entered into these contracts to mitigate any price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar certain of these contracts were designated as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income amounts recorded to other comprehensive income are classified to operating revenues or fuel purchased power and gas expense when the related hedged item impacts earnings 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the fair value of financial instruments is determined by using various market data and other valuation techniques the table below shows the fair value relative to the carrying value for longterm debt securities the carrying value of certain other financial instruments such as notes payable customer deposits and notes receivable approximate fair value and are not shown 

 

note 15  commitments and contingencies 

environmental 

electric utility 

air  detroit edison is subject to epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in march 2005 epa issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new 

rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements detroit edison has spent approximately 875 million through 2006 we estimate detroit edison future capital expenditures at up to 222 million in 2007 and up to 2 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements 

water – in response to an epa regulation detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of the studies to be conducted over the next several years detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes initially it was estimated that the company could incur up to approximately 53 million over the next three to five years in additional capital expenditures to comply with these requirements however a recent court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation resulting in a delay in complying with the regulation the decision also raised the possibility that the company may have to install cooling towers at some facilities at a cost substantially greater than was initially estimated for other mitigative technologies 

contaminated sites  detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including two former mgp sites the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations the findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is approximately 11 million which was accrued in 2006 and is expected to be incurred over the next several years in addition detroit edison expects to make approximately 5 million of capital improvements to the ash landfill in 2007 

gas utility 

contaminated sites  prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil gas utility owns or previously owned 15 such former manufactured gas plant mgp sites investigations have revealed contamination related to the byproducts of gas manufacturing at each site in addition to the mgp sites we are also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 

in 1993 a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism was approved by the mpsc for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former mgp sites as a result of a study completed in 1995 gas utility accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of 35 million during 2006 we spent approximately 2 million investigating and remediating these former mgp sites in december 2006 we retained multiple environmental consultants to estimate the projected cost to remediate each mgp site we accrued an additional 7 million in remediation liabilities associated with former mgp holders and additional cleanup cost to increase the reserve balance to 41 million as of december 31 2006 with a corresponding increase in the regulatory asset 

any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect the company’s financial position and cash flows however we anticipate the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the mpsc will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

other 

our nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we are in the process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facilities in michigan we expect the projects to be 

completed within one year at a cost of approximately 14 million our other nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 

guarantees 

in certain limited circumstances we enter into contractual guarantees we may guarantee another entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform we may provide guarantees in certain indemnification agreements finally we may provide indirect guarantees for the indebtedness of others below are the details of specific material guarantees we currently provide our other guarantees are not individually material and total approximately 22 million at december 31 2006 

parent company guarantee of subsidiary obligations 

we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various nonutility subsidiary transactions in the event that dte energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately 383 million at december 31 2006 this estimated amount fluctuates based upon commodity prices primarily power and gas and the provisions and maturities of the underlying agreements 

personal property taxes 

detroit edison michcon and other michigan utilities have asserted that michigan’s valuation tables result in the substantial overvaluation of utility personal property valuation tables established by the michigan state tax commission stc are used to determine the taxable value of personal property based on the property’s age in november 1999 the stc approved new valuation tables that more accurately recognize the value of a utility’s personal property the new tables became effective in 2000 and are currently used to calculate property tax expense however several local taxing jurisdictions took legal action attempting to prevent the stc from implementing the new valuation tables and continued to prepare assessments based on the superseded tables 

in december 2005 a settlement agreement was reached and executed stipulations for consent judgment consent judgments and schedules to consent judgment were filed with the michigan tax tribunal on behalf of detroit edison michcon and a significant number of the largest jurisdictions in terms of tax dollars involved in the litigation the filing of these documents fulfilled the requirements of the settlement agreement and resolves a number of claims by the litigants against each other including both property and nonproperty issues the settlement agreement resulted in a pretax economic benefit to dte energy of 43 million in 2005 that included the release of a litigation reserve 

labor contracts 

there are several bargaining units for our represented employees approximately 3245 of our represented employees are under contracts that expire in june 2007 and 970 employees are under contracts that expire in october 2007 the contracts of the remaining represented employees expire at various dates in 2008 and 2009 

other commitments 

detroit edison has an energy purchase agreement to purchase steam and electricity from the greater detroit resource recovery authority gdrra under the agreement detroit edison will purchase steam through 2008 and electricity through june 2024 in 1996 a special charge to income was recorded that included a reserve for steam purchase commitments in excess of replacement costs from 1997 through 2008 the reserve for steam purchase commitments is being amortized to fuel purchased power and gas expense with noncash accretion expense being recorded through 2008 we purchased approximately 42 million of steam and electricity in 2006 2005 and 2004 we estimate steam and 

electric purchase commitments through 2024 will not exceed 386 million in january 2003 we sold the steam heating business of detroit edison to thermal ventures ii lp due to terms of the sale detroit edison remains contractually obligated to buy steam from gdrra until 2008 and recorded an additional liability of 63 million for future commitments also we have guaranteed bank loans that thermal ventures ii lp may use for capital improvements to the steam heating system 

in 2004 we modified our future purchase commitments under a transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company and terminated a related longterm gas exchange storage agreement under the gas exchange agreement we received gas from the customer during the summer injection period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season the agreements were at rates that were not reflective of current market conditions and had been fair valued under accounting principles generally accepted in the us in 2002 the fair value of the transportation agreement was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a derivative as a result of ferc order 637 the fair value amounts were being amortized to income over the life of the related agreements representing a net liability of approximately 75 million as of december 31 2003 as a result of the contract modification and termination we recorded an adjustment to the net liability increasing 2004 earnings by 48 million net of taxes 

as of december 31 2006 we were party to numerous longterm purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods and services required for our business these agreements primarily consist of fuel supply commitments and energy trading contracts we estimate that these commitments will be approximately 65 billion through 2051 we also estimate that 2007 capital expenditures will be 15 billion we have made certain commitments in connection with expected capital expenditures 

bankruptcies 

we purchase and sell electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail and other industries certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code we regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss we believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable losses the final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

other 

detroit edison and dte coal services inc are involved in a contract dispute with bnsf railway company that has been referred to arbitration under this contract bnsf transports western coals east for detroit edison and dte coal services we have filed a breach of contract claim against bnsf for the failure to provide certain services that we believe are required by the contract the arbitration hearing is scheduled for mid2007 while we believe we will prevail on the merits in this matter a negative decision with respect to the significant issues being heard in the arbitration could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow the coal and gas midstream business segment as currently contemplated 

we are involved in certain legal regulatory administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings include certain contract disputes environmental reviews and investigations audits inquiries from various regulators and pending judicial matters we cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings we regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss the resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in the period they are resolved

note 16  retirement benefits and trusteed assets 

adoption of sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r  sfas 158 requires companies to 1 recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and defined benefit other postretirement plans in its financial statements 2 recognize as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 3 recognize adjustments to other comprehensive income when the actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations are recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 4 measure postretirement benefit plan assets and plan obligations as of the date of the employer’s statement of financial position and 5 disclose additional information in the notes to financial statements about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost in the upcoming fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service cost and credits 

the requirement to recognize the funded status of a postretirement benefit plan and the related disclosure requirements is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 we adopted this requirement as of december 31 2006 the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 we plan to adopt this requirement as of december 31 2008 

detroit edison received approval from the mpsc to record the charge related to the additional liability as a miscellaneous deferred debit in the regulatory asset line on the consolidated statement of financial position since the traditional rate setting process allows for the recovery of pension and other postretirement plan costs retrospective application of the changes required by sfas no 158 is prohibited therefore certain disclosures below are not comparable

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we changed the date for actuarial measurement of our obligations for benefit programs from december 31 to november 30 we believe the onemonth change of the measurement date is a preferable change as it allows time for management to plan and execute its review of the completeness and accuracy of its benefit programs results and to fully reflect the impact on its financial results the change did not have a material effect on retained earnings as of january 1 2004 and income from continuing operations net income and related per share amounts for any interim period in 2004 accordingly all amounts reported in the following tables for balances as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 are based on measurement dates of november 30 2006 and november 30 2005 respectively amounts reported in tables for the year ended december 31 2006 are based on a measurement date of november 30 2005 amounts reported in tables for the year ended december 31 2005 are based on a measurement date of november 30 2004 amounts reported in tables for the year ended december 31 2004 are based on a measurement date of december 31 2003 

qualified and nonqualified pension plan benefits 

we have qualified defined benefit retirement plans for eligible represented and nonrepresented employees the plans are noncontributory and cover substantially all employees the plans provide traditional retirement benefits based on the employees’ years of benefit service average final compensation and age at retirement in addition certain represented and nonrepresented employees are 

covered under cash balance provisions that base benefits on annual employer contributions and interest credits we also maintain supplemental nonqualified noncontributory retirement benefit plans for selected management employees these plans provide for benefits that supplement those provided by dte energy’s other retirement plans 

our policy is to fund qualified pension costs by contributing amounts consistent with the pension protection act of 2006 provisions and additional amounts when we deem appropriate in december 2006 we contributed 180 million to the qualified pension plans and 15 million to the nonqualified pension plans we anticipate making up to a 180 million contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2007 and a 15 million contribution to our nonqualified pension plans in 2007 

net pension cost includes the following components 

 

amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss and regulatory assets expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during 2007 are comprised of 56 million of net actuarial loss and 5 million of prior service cost relating to qualified pension plans and 2 million of net actuarial loss and 1 million of prior service cost relating to nonqualified pension plans we recorded a 49 million pension cost associated with our performance excellence process in 2006 

the following table reconciles the obligations assets and funded status of the plans as well as the amounts recognized as prepaid pension cost or pension liability in the consolidated statement of financial position at december 31 

 

 

 123 

assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net pension costs are listed below 

 

at december 31 2006 the benefits related to our qualified and nonqualified plans expected to be paid in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows 

 

we employ a consistent formal process in determining the longterm rate of return for various asset classes we evaluate input from our consultants including their review of historic financial market risks and returns and longterm historic relationships between the asset classes of equities fixed income and other assets consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the longterm current market factors such as inflation interest rates asset class risks and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before longterm capital market assumptions are determined the longterm portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process with due consideration of diversification active investment management and rebalancing peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness 

we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities fixed income and other investments are used to maximize the longterm return on plan assets consistent with prudent levels of risk the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses over the longterm risk tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows plan funded status and corporate financial considerations the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity fixed income and other investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across us and nonus stocks growth and value investment styles and large and small market capitalizations other assets such as private equity and absolute return funds are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification derivatives may be utilized in a risk controlled manner to potentially increase the portfolio beyond the market value of invested assets and reduce portfolio investment risk investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 

our plans’ weightedaverage asset allocations by asset category at december 31 were as follows 

 

our plans’ weightedaverage asset target allocations by asset category at december 31 2006 were as follows 

 

we also sponsor defined contribution retirement savings plans participation in one of these plans is available to substantially all represented and nonrepresented employees we match employee contributions up to certain predefined limits based upon eligible compensation the employee’s contribution rate and in some cases years of credited service the cost of these plans was 29 million in 2006 29 million in 2005 and 28 million in 2004 

other postretirement benefits 

we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for employees who are eligible for these benefits our policy is to fund certain trusts to meet our postretirement benefit obligations separate qualified voluntary employees beneficiary association veba trusts exist for represented and nonrepresented employees in 2006 we made cash contributions of 116 million to our postretirement benefit plans at the discretion of management we may make up to a 116 million contribution to our veba trusts in 2007 

net postretirement cost includes the following components 

 

amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss or regulatory assets expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during 2007 are comprised of 66 million of net actuarial loss 2 million gain of prior service cost and 7 million of net transition obligation we recorded an 8 million postretirement benefit cost associated with our performance excellence process in 2006 

the following table reconciles the obligations assets and funded status of the plans including amounts recorded as accrued postretirement cost in the consolidated statement of financial position at december 31 

 

 

 126 

assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net benefit costs are listed below 

 

benefit costs were calculated assuming health care cost trend rates beginning at 9  for 2006 and decreasing to 5 in 2011 and thereafter for persons under age 65 and decreasing from 8 to 5 for persons age 65 and over a onepercentagepoint increase in health care cost trend rates would have increased the total service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs by 30 million and increased the accumulated benefit obligation by 272 million at december 31 2006 a onepercentagepoint decrease in the health care cost trend rates would have decreased the total service and interest cost components of benefit costs by 25 million and would have decreased the accumulated benefit obligation by 230 million at december 31 2006 

at december 31 2006 the benefits expected to be paid including prescription drug benefits in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows 

 

in december 2003 the medicare act was signed into law which provides for a nontaxable federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least “actuarially equivalent” to the benefit established by law as discussed in note 3 we adopted fsp no 1062 in 2004 which provides guidance on the accounting for the medicare act as a result of the adoption our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits attributed to past service was reduced by approximately 95 million at january 1 2004 and was accounted for as an actuarial gain the effects of the subsidy reduced net periodic postretirement benefit costs by 17 million in 2006 20 million in 2005 and 16 million in 2004 

at december 31 2006 the gross amount of federal subsidies expected to be received in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter was as follows 

 

the process used in determining the longterm rate of return for assets and the investment approach for our other postretirement benefits plans is similar to those previously described for our qualified pension plans 

our plans’ weightedaverage asset allocations by asset category at december 31 were as follows 

 

our plans’ weightedaverage asset target allocations by asset category at december 31 2006 were as follows 

 

the adoption of sfas no 158 had the following incremental effect on the financial statement line items shown below 

 

grantor trust 

michcon maintains a grantor trust that invests in life insurance contracts and income securities employees and retirees have no right title or interest in the assets of the grantor trust and michcon can revoke the trust subject to providing the mpsc with prior notification we account for our investment at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to earnings 

note 17 – stockbased compensation 

the dte energy stock incentive plan permits the grant of incentive stock options nonqualifying stock options stock awards performance shares and performance units participants in the plan include our employees and members of our board of directors in the second quarter of 2006 we adopted a new longterm incentive program ltip 

the following are the key points of the newly adopted ltip 

 

as of december 31 2006 no performance units have been granted under either the ltip or the previous stock incentive plan 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment using the modified prospective transition method under this method we record compensation expense at fair value over the vesting period for all awards we grant after the date we adopted the standard in addition we are required to record compensation expense at fair value as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested 

portion of previously granted stock option awards that were outstanding as of the date of adoption preadoption awards of stock awards and performance shares will continue to be expensed dte did not make the onetime election to adopt the alternative transition method described in fsp sfas 123r3 transition election related to accounting for the tax effect of sharebased payment awards but has chosen instead to follow the original guidance provided by sfas 123r in accounting for the tax effects of stock based compensation awards 

the adoption of sfas 123r in 2006 resulted in the following 

 

stockbased compensation for the reporting periods is as follows 

 

the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas 123r was an increase in net income of 1 million as a result of estimating forfeitures for previously granted stock awards and performance shares we have not restated any prior periods as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r we generally purchase shares on the open market for options that are exercised or we may settle in cash other stock based compensation 

options 

options are exercisable according to the terms of the individual stock option award agreements and expire 10 years after the date of the grant the option exercise price equals the fair value of the stock on the date that the option was granted 

stock option activity was as follows 

 

 

 130 

the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 2006 2005 and 2004 was 612 589 446 respectively the intrinsic value of options exercised for both the year ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 6 million 8 million and 7 million respectively total option expense recognized during 2006 was 6 million 

the number weighted average exercise price and weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding were as follows 

 

we determine the fair value for these options at the date of grant using a blackscholes based option pricing model and the following assumptions 

 

in connection with the adoption of sfas 123r we reviewed and updated our forfeiture expected term and volatility assumptions we modified option volatility to include both historical and implied shareprice volatility implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on dte energy common stock volatility for 2006 was estimated based solely upon historical shareprice volatility our expected term is based on industry standards 

pro forma information for the periods ended december 31 2005 and 2004 is provided to show what our net income and earnings per share would have been if compensation costs had been determined as prescribed by sfas 123r 

 

stock awards 

stock awards granted under the plan are restricted for varying periods which are generally for three years participants have all rights of a shareholder with respect to a stock award including the right to receive dividends and vote the shares prior to vesting in stock awards the participant i may not sell transfer pledge exchange or otherwise dispose of shares ii shall not retain custody of the share certificates and iii will deliver to us a stock power with respect to each stock award 

the stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates fair value on the date of grant we account for stock awards as unearned compensation which is recorded as a reduction to common stock the cost is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period 

stock award activity for the periods ended december 31 was 

 

the following table summarizes our stock awards activity for the period ended december 31 2006 

 

performance share awards 

performance shares awarded under the plan are for a specified number of shares of common stock that entitles the holder to receive a cash payment shares of common stock or a combination thereof the final value of the award is determined by the achievement of certain performance objectives and market conditions the awards vest at the end of a specified period usually three years we account for performance share awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period based on i the number of shares expected to be paid which is based on the probable achievement of performance objectives and ii the fair value of the shares 

we recorded compensation expense as follows 

 

 

 during the vesting period the recipient of a performance share award has no shareholder rights however recipients will be paid an amount equal to the dividend equivalent on such shares performance share awards are nontransferable and are subject to risk of forfeiture as of december 31 2006 there were 1035696 performance share awards outstanding 

the following table summarizes our performance share activity for the period ended december 31 2006 

 

unrecognized compensation costs 

as of december 31 2006 there was 26 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock incentive plan arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 135 years 

 

the tax benefit realized for tax deductions related to our stock incentive plan totaled 8 million for the period ended december 31 2006 approximately 16 million of compensation cost was capitalized as a part of fixed assets during 2006 

note 18  segment and related information 

in the third quarter of 2006 we realigned the nonutility segment power and industrial projects business unit to separately present the synthetic fuel business the impending expiration of synfuel tax credits as of december 31 2007 combined with the sustained volatility of oil prices increased management focus on synfuels thereby requiring a separate business segment in the fourth quarter of 2006 we separated the fuel transportation and marketing segment into coal and gas midstream and energy trading corresponding to additional management focus on the results of these nonutility segments based on the following structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance 

electric utility 

 

gas utility 

 

nonutility operations 

 

corporate  other  primarily consisting of corporate staff functions and certain energy related investments 

prior year segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current year’s segment structure 

the income tax provisions or benefits of dte energy’s subsidiaries are determined on an individual company basis and recognize the tax benefit of production tax credits and net operating losses the subsidiaries record income tax payable to or receivable from dte energy resulting from the inclusion of its taxable income or loss in dte energy’s consolidated federal tax return 

intersegment billing for goods and services exchanged between segments is based upon tariffed or marketbased prices of the provider and primarily consists of power sales gas sales and coal transportation services in the following segments 

 

financial data of the business segments follows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2006 revenues in excess of 9 billion and approximately 24 billion in assets we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales distribution and storage services throughout southeastern michigan we operate five energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

the decrease in 2006 net income is primarily due to the temporary idling of synfuel plants along with the associated impairments and reserves and impairments within our power and industrial projects segment this decrease was partially offset by higher earnings at our electric utility detroit edison and energy trading segment marktomarket losses in 2005 which did not recur in 2006 

the items discussed below influenced our current financial performance and may affect future results 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utility operations 

weather  earnings from our utility operations are seasonal and very sensitive to weather electric utility earnings are primarily dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utility’s results are primarily dependent on cold winter weather during 2006 we experienced milder than normal weather conditions 

additionally we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages restoration and other costs associated with stormrelated power outages lowered pretax earnings by 46 million in 2006 82 million in 2005 and 48 million in 2004 

receivables  both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables especially within our gas utility operations the increase is attributable to economic conditions higher natural gas prices and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers 

we have taken aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables including increased customer disconnections contracting with collection agencies and working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers in 2006 we sold previously writtenoff accounts of 43 million resulting in a gain and net proceeds of 19 million the gain was recorded as a recovery through bad debt expense which is included within operation and maintenance expense 

as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts expense for the two utilities increased to 123 million in 2006 from 98 million in 2005 and from 105 million in 2004 

the april 2005 mpsc gas rate order provided for an uncollectible trueup mechanism for michcon we filed the 2005 annual reconciliation comparing our actual uncollectible expense to our designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million on an annual basis the mpsc approved the 2005 annual reconciliation on december 21 2006 allowing michcon to surcharge the 11 million excess beginning in january 2007 

we expect to file the 2006 annual reconciliation with the mpsc no later than march 31 2007 comparing our actual 2006 uncollectible expense to our designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million ninety percent of the difference for the year will be requested to be surcharged as part of the annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc we have accrued 33 million under the 2006 uncollectible trueup mechanism 

regulatory activity  in accordance with the mpsc’s directive in detroit edison’s november 2004 rate order in march 2005 detroit edison filed a joint application and testimony in its 2004 pscr reconciliation case and its 2004 net stranded cost recovery case in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order recognizing 19 million of 2004 net stranded costs that required detroit edison to write off 112 million of 2004 net stranded costs the mpsc order resulted in a 39 million reduction in the 2004 pscr overcollection by allowing detroit edison to retain the benefit of third party wholesale sales 

required to support the electric customer choice program and to offset the recognition of the 19 million of 2004 stranded costs the mpsc order also resulted in reductions in accrued interest on the 2004 and 2005 pscr amounts of 15 million the mpsc directed detroit edison to include the remaining 2004 pscr overcollection amount and related interest in the 2005 pscr reconciliation which is in an undercollected position the order resulted in a reduction of pretax income of approximately 58 million 

the following graph depicts the total electric customer choice volumes for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier 

electric customer choice volumes in mwh 

in march 2006 the mpsc issued an order directing detroit edison to show cause by june 1 2006 why its retail electric rates should not be reduced in 2007 the mpsc issued an order approving the settlement agreement in this proceeding on august 31 2006 the order provided for an annualized rate reduction of 53 million for 2006 effective september 5 2006 beginning january 1 2007 and continuing until the later of march 31 2008 or 12 months from the filing date of detroit edison’s next main rate case rates will be reduced by an additional 26 million for a total reduction of 79 million detroit edison experienced a rate reduction of approximately 13 million in 2006 as a result of this order the revenue reduction is net of the recovery of the amortization of the costs associated with the implementation of the performance excellence process the settlement agreement provides for some level of realignment of the existing rate structure by allocating a larger percentage share of the rate reduction to the commercial and industrial customer classes than to the residential customer classes 

coal supply — our generating fleet produces approximately 70 of its electricity from coal increasing coal demand from domestic and international markets has resulted in significant price increases in addition difficulty in recruiting workers obtaining environmental permits and finding economically recoverable amounts of new coal has resulted in decreasing coal output from the central appalachian region furthermore as a result of environmental regulation and declining eastern coal stocks demand for cleaner burning western coal has increased this increased demand for western coal has also resulted in a corresponding demand for western rail shipping straining railroad capacity resulting in longer lead times for western coal shipments 

nuclear fuel  we operate one nuclear facility that undergoes a periodic refueling outage approximately every eighteen months uranium prices have been rising due to supply concerns in the future there may be additional nuclear facilities constructed in the industry that may place additional pressure on uranium supplies and prices we have a contract with the us department of energy doe for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from fermi 2 we are obligated to pay the doe a fee of 1 mill per kwh of fermi 2 electricity generated and sold the fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense delays 

have occurred in the doe’s program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository until the doe is able to fulfill its obligation under the contract we are responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage we are currently expanding the fermi 2 spent fuel pool capacity to meet our storage requirements through 2009 we are a party in the litigation against the doe for both past and future costs associated with the doe’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the federal nuclear waste policy act of 1982 

nonutility operations 

we have made significant investments in nonutility assetintensive businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets skill and expertise specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile a number of factors have impacted our nonutility businesses including the effect of oil prices on the synthetic fuel business losses from certain power generation assets losses from our waste coal recovery and landfill gas recovery businesses and earnings volatility in our energy trading business as part of a strategic review of our nonutility operations we are considering various actions including the sale restructuring or recapitalization of various nonutility businesses which we expect may generate over 800 million in cash proceeds in 2007 we plan to continue to invest in focused areas that have the strongest opportunities 

the primary source of recent investment capital has been cash flow from the synfuel business we have hedged a portion the risk of an oil pricerelated phaseout of production tax credits in the synfuel business we now anticipate approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments tax credit carryforward utilization in part could be extended past 2009 if taxable income is reduced from current forecasts 

coal and gas midstream 

we are continuing to build our capacity to transport greater amounts of western coal and to expand into coal terminals to allow for increased coal storage and blending we are currently involved in a contract dispute with bnsf railway company that has been referred to arbitration under this contract bnsf transports western coal east for detroit edison and the coal transportation and marketing business we have filed a breach of contract claim against bnsf for the failure to provide certain services that we believe are required by the contract the arbitration hearing is scheduled for mid2007 while we believe we will prevail on the merits in this matter a negative decision with respect to the significant issues being heard in the arbitration could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow the coal transportation and marketing business as currently contemplated 

pipelines processing and storage is continuing its steady growth plan of expansion of storage capacity in michigan and expanding and building new pipeline capacity to serve markets in the midwest and northeast united states 

unconventional gas production 

current natural gas prices provide attractive opportunities for our unconventional gas production business segment we are an experienced operator with more than 15 years of experience in the antrim shale in northern michigan and we continue to expand our operations in the barnett shale basin in north texas where recent leasehold acquisitions have increased our total leasehold acreage to 89808 acres 80530 net of interest of others after reduction by opportunistic sales of 11193 acres 

we are exploring the sale of a portion of our unconventional gas production assets which will allow us to monetize value from our more mature holdings while retaining the ability to benefit from the upside of our earlier stage holdings 

antrim shale — we intend to develop existing acreage using the latest vertical and horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation techniques our longterm fixedprice obligations for production of antrim continue to expire in 2007 this will create opportunities to remarket antrim production at significantly higher current market rates 

 

 

 barnett shale  we anticipate significant opportunities in our existing barnett shale acreage and expect continued extension of producing areas within the fort worth basin we are currently in the test and development phase for unproved and recently acquired barnett shale acreage 

 

 

 current natural gas prices and successes within the barnett shale are resulting in more capital being invested into the region the competition for opportunities and goods and services may result in increased operating costs however our experience in the antrim shale and our experienced barnett shale personnel provide an advantage in addressing potential cost increases we invested 186 million in 

2006 and expect to invest a combined amount of approximately 150 million to 170 million in our unconventional gas business in 2007 

as a component of our risk management strategy for our barnett shale reserves we hedged a portion of our proved developed producing reserves to secure an attractive investment return as of december 31 2006 we entered into a series of cash flow hedges for 47 bcf of anticipated gas production through 2010 at an average price of 808 per mcf 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver utilitytype services to industrial commercial and institutional customers and biomass energy projects we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries these services include pulverized coal and petroleum coke supply power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply we own and operate three gasfired peaking electric generating plants and a biomassfired electric generating plant and operate one additional gasfired power plant under contract additionally we own a gasfired peaking electric generating plant that was taken out of service in september 2006 we develop own and operate landfill gas recovery systems throughout the united states we produce coke from two coke batteries the production of coke from our coke batteries generates production tax credits assuming no phaseout 

we are exploring the combination of a sale of an equity interest in and recapitalization of some of the assets of the power and industrial projects business including the sale or restructuring of the power generation assets in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell our georgetown peaking electric generating facility the sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2007 

energy trading 

significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions most financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting periods we may incur marktomarket accounting gains or losses in one period that will reverse in subsequent periods when transactions are settled 

during 2005 our earnings were negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas in addition we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts the financial impacts of these timing differences have begun to reverse and have favorably impacted results during 2006 we are exploring strategic options for the energy trading business 

synthetic fuel 

synthetic fuel operations 

synfuel plants chemically change coal and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code production tax credits are provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal and are available through december 31 2007 the synthetic fuel plants generate operating losses which we expect to be offset by production tax credits the value of a production tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor and published annually by the internal revenue service irs the value is reduced if the reference price of a barrel of oil exceeds certain thresholds 

we are the operator of nine synthetic fuel production facilities throughout the united states on may 12 2006 we idled production at all nine of the synthetic fuel facilities the decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the level and volatility of oil prices at that time during the idle period we took various steps to reduce our oil price exposure including renegotiation of a significant number of commercial agreements beginning september 5 2006 through october 4 2006 we resumed production at each of the nine synfuel facilities due to these amended commercial agreements and declines in the level of oil prices 

recognition of synfuel gains 

to optimize income and cash flow from the synfuel operations we sold interests in all nine of the facilities representing 91 of the total production capacity as of december 31 2006 proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels and the value of credits generated gains from the sale of an interest in a synfuel project are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable the probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is assured in substance we receive synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold 

the gain from the sale of synfuel facilities is generally comprised of fixed and variable components the fixed component represents note payments is not subject to refund and is recognized as a gain when earned and collectibility is assured the variable component is based on an estimate of tax credits allocated to our partners and is subject to refund based on the annual oil price phaseout the variable component is recognized as a gain only when the probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is assured additionally our partners reimburse us through the project entity for the operating losses of the synfuel facilities referred to as capital contributions in the event that the tax credit is phased out we are contractually obligated to refund an amount equal to all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners to assess the probability and estimate the amount of refund we use valuation and analysis models that calculate the probability of the reference price of oil for the year being within or exceeding the phaseout range due to changes in the agreements with certain of our synfuel partners and the exercise of existing rights by other synfuels partners a higher percentage of the payments in 2006 were variable payments as a result a larger portion of the 2006 synfuel payments are subject to refund as a result of the phaseout and therefore reduced the gain associated with the payments 

crude oil prices 

the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate by the irs of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil the value of the production tax credit in a given year is reduced if the reference price of oil over the year exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if that same reference price exceeds a phaseout price during 2006 the annual average wellhead price is projected to be approximately 6 lower than the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for light sweet crude oil the actual or estimated reference price and beginning and ending phaseout prices per barrel of oil for 2005 through 2007 are as follows 

 

the nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil for 2006 averaged approximately 66 which is approximately equal to a reference price of 60 per barrel which we estimate to be within the phaseout range the actual tax credit phaseout for 2006 will not be certain until the reference price is published by the irs in april 2007 there is a risk of at least a partial phaseout of the production tax credits in 2007 which could adversely impact our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

hedging of synfuel cash flows 

as discussed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have entered into derivative and other contracts to economically hedge a portion of our synfuel cash flow exposure to the risk of oil prices increasing the derivative contracts are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains to manage our exposure in 2007 to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could substantially reduce or eliminate synfuel sales proceeds we entered into a series of derivative contracts covering a specified number of barrels of oil the derivative contracts involve purchased and written call options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the full years’ 2007 average nymex trading prices for light sweet crude oil in relation to the strike prices of each option if the average nymex prices of oil in 2007 are less than approximately 60 per barrel the derivatives will yield no payment if the average nymex prices of oil exceed approximately 60 per barrel the derivatives will yield a payment equal to the excess of the average nymex price over these initial strike prices multiplied by the number of barrels covered up to a maximum price of approximately 76 per barrel these contracts are based on various terms to take advantage of increases in oil prices we recorded pretax marktomarket gains of 60 million during 2006 and 47 million in 2005 and a 12 million loss in 2004 the fair value changes are recorded as adjustments to the gain from selling interests in synfuel facilities and are included in the asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net line item in the consolidated statement of operations we paid approximately 50 million for 2006 hedges for which we received payments of approximately 156 million upon settlement of these hedges in january 2007 through december 31 2006 we paid approximately 103 million for 2007 hedges which will provide protection for a significant portion of our cash flows related to the synfuel production during 2007 as part of our synfuel related risk management strategy we continue to evaluate alternatives available to mitigate unhedged exposure to oil price volatility as our risk management position changes due to market volatility we may adjust our hedging strategy in response to changing conditions 

risks and exposures 

since there was the likelihood that the reference price for a barrel of oil would remain above the threshold at which synfuelrelated production tax credits began to phaseout we deferred gain recognition associated with variable and certain fixed note payments in 2006 until the end of the year when the probability of refund was remote and collectibility was assured we deferred all variable gains for the first three quarters of 2006 and 2005 we recognized 43 million of fixed gains and 14 million of variable gains in 2006 compared to fixed gains of 132 million and variable gains of 187 million in 2005 all or a portion of the deferred gains will be recognized when and if the gain recognition criteria is met additionally we may establish reserves for potential refunds of amounts related to partners’ capital contributions associated with operating losses allocated to their account as previously discussed in the event of a tax credit phaseout we are contractually obligated to refund to our partners all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners 

in 2006 we recorded reserves and impairments of 157 million consisting of a 79 million reserve for capital contributions related to operating losses and an impairment of 78 million for synfuelrelated fixed assets and inventory the fixed asset impairment was partially offset by 70 million included in the minority interest line on our consolidated statement of operations representing our partners’ share of the asset write down 

cash from synfuel activity is at risk of a phaseout of the production tax credits we expect approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations asset sales and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments the expected cash flow of approximately 900 million is economically hedged against the movement in oil prices in addition a goodwill writeoff of up to 4 million will likely be required in 2007 due to the production tax credit phaseout the inability to generate new production tax credits after 2007 and the resulting discontinuance of synfuel production we have fixed note receivables associated with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities a partial or full phaseout of production tax credits could adversely affect the collectibility of our receivables the cash flow impact would likely reduce our ability to execute our investment and growth strategy 

operating system and performance excellence process 

we continuously review and adjust our cost structure and seek improvements in our processes beginning in 2002 we adopted the dte energy operating system which is the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies inventory reductions and improvements in 

technology systems among other enhancements some of these cost reductions may be returned to our customers in the form of lower pscr charges and the remaining amounts may impact our profitability 

as an extension of this effort in mid2005 we initiated a companywide review of our operations called the performance excellence process the overarching goal has been and remains to become more competitive by reducing costs eliminating waste and optimizing business processes while improving customer service many of our customers are under intense economic pressure and will benefit from our efforts to keep down our costs and their rates additionally we will need significant resources in the future to invest in the infrastructure necessary to compete specifically we began a series of focused improvement initiatives within our electric and gas utilities and our corporate support function 

the process is rigorous and challenging and seeks to yield sustainable performance to our customers and shareholders we have identified the performance excellence process as critical to our longterm growth strategy detroit edison’s cta is estimated to total between 160 million and 190 million michcon’s cta is estimated to total between 55 million and 60 millionwe estimate savings of approximately 45 million in operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs were realized in 2006 in 2006 we recorded cta of approximately 134 million cta in 2006 exceeded our savings but we expect to realize sustained net cost savings beginning in 2007 

in september 2006 the mpsc issued an order approving a settlement agreement that allows detroit edison and michcon commencing in 2006 to defer the incremental cta further the order provides for detroit edison and michcon to amortize the cta deferrals over a tenyear period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the cta was deferred detroit edison deferred approximately 102 million of cta in 2006 as a regulatory asset and will begin amortizing deferred 2006 costs in 2007 as the recovery of these costs was provided for by the mpsc in the order approving the settlement in the show cause proceeding michcon cannot defer cta costs at this time because a recovery mechanism has not been established 

capital investment 

we anticipate significant capital investment across all of our business segments most of our capital expenditures will be concentrated within our utility segments our electric utility currently expects to invest approximately 43 billion including increased environmental requirements and reliability enhancement projects through 2011 our gas utility currently expects to invest approximately 10 billion on system expansion pipeline safety and reliability enhancement projects through the same period we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment 

in 2005 we launched the first phase of our enterprise business systems project an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems through december 2006 we have spent approximately 330 million on this project and we anticipate spending an additional 45 million to 70 million over the next year as the remaining system elements are developed and implemented 

in the future we may build a new baseload coal or nuclear electric generating plant the last baseload plant constructed within our electric utility service territory was approximately twenty years ago 

outlook 

the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth due to the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 and the repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 there are fewer barriers to mergers and acquisitions of utility companies at the federal level however the expected industry consolidation resulting in the creation of large regional utility providers has been recently impacted by actions of regulators in certain states affected by the proposed transactions 

looking forward we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance 

 

along with pursuing a leaner organization we anticipate approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet we expect to use any such cash and the potential cash from monetization of certain of our nonutility assets and operations to reduce debt and repurchase common stock and to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios to improve our current credit rating and outlook and to have any monetizations be accretive to earnings per share 

results of operations 

net income in 2006 was 433 million or 243 per diluted share compared to net income of 537 million or 305 per diluted share in 2005 and net income of 431 million or 249 per diluted share in 2004 excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes our income from continuing operations in 2006 was 437 million or 245 per diluted share compared to income of 577 million or 328 per diluted share in 2005 and income of 464 million or 268 per diluted share in 2004 the following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments’ operating performance and future outlook 

segments realigned — in the third quarter of 2006 we realigned the nonutility segment power and industrial projects business unit to separately present the synthetic fuel business the impending expiration of synfuel tax credits as of december 31 2007 combined with the sustained volatility of oil prices increased management focus on synfuels thereby requiring a separate business segment in the fourth quarter of 2006 we separated the fuel transportation and marketing segment into coal and gas midstream and energy trading corresponding to additional management focus on the results of these nonutility segments based on the following structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance 

 

 

 

 

 

 electric utility 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison which is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electric energy to approximately 22 million customers in southeastern michigan 

factors impacting income our net income increased 48 million and 127 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively these results primarily reflect higher gross margins partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses additionally 2005 results were affected by higher rates due to the november 2004 mpsc final rate order return of customers from the electric customer choice program warmer weather and lower operations and maintenance expenses partially offset by a portion of higher fuel and purchased power costs which were unrecoverable as a result of residential rate caps which expired january 1 2006 and increased depreciation and amortization expenses 

 

gross margin increased 299 million during 2006 and 189 million in 2005 the 2006 improvement was primarily due to increased rates due to the expiration of the residential rate cap on january 1 2006 and returning sales from electric customer choice partially offset by milder weather the increase in 2005 was due to higher demand resulting from warmer weather and increased rates due to the november 2004 mpsc final rate order partially offset by unrecovered power supply costs as a result of residential rate caps which expired january 1 2006 and a poor michigan economy gross margin was favorably impacted by decreased electric customer choice penetration whereby we lost 6 of retail sales to electric customer choice customers in 2006 and 12 of such sales during 2005 as retail customers migrated back to us as their electric generation provider rather than remaining with alternative suppliers pursuant to the mpsc final rate order transmission expense previously recorded in operation and maintenance expenses in 2004 is now reflected in purchased power expenses the pscr mechanism provides related revenues for the transmission expense 

the following table displays changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 operation and maintenance expense increased 28 million in 2006 and decreased 87 million in 2005 the 2006 increase was primarily due to increased distribution system maintenance of 35 million and increased plant outages of 33 million which was partially offset by 36 million of lower storm expenses pursuant to mpsc authorization detroit edison deferred approximately 102 million of cta in 2006 the comparability of 2005 to 2004 is affected by the november 2004 mpsc final rate order which required transmission and miso expenses to be included in purchased power expense with related revenues to be recorded through the pscr mechanism additionally the dte energy parent company no longer allocated mergerrelated interest as a result of the november 2004 mpsc final rate order which was partially offset by higher 2005 storm expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 169 million and 117 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 increase was due to a 112 million net stranded cost writeoff related to the september 2006 mpsc order regarding stranded costs and a 19 million increase in our asset retirement obligation at our fermi 1 nuclear facility we also had increased amortization of regulatory assets of 19 million related to electric customer choice and 8 million related to our securitized assets the 2005 increase reflects the income effect of recording regulatory assets in 2004 which lowered depreciation and 

amortization expenses the regulatory asset deferrals totaled 46 million in 2005 and 107 million in 2004 additionally higher 2005 sales volumes compared to 2004 resulted in greater amortization of regulatory assets 

asset gains and losses net decreased 20 million in 2006 and increased 25 million in 2005 primarily as a result of our 2005 sale of land near our headquarters in detroit michigan 

other income and deductions expense increased 11 million in 2006 and decreased 20 million in 2005 the 2006 increase is attributable to higher interest expense due to increased longterm debt the 2005 decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense as a result of lower interest rates and a favorable adjustment related to tax audit settlements 

outlook — we continue to improve the operating performance of detroit edison during the past year we have resolved a portion of our regulatory issues and continue to pursue additional regulatory andor legislative solutions for structural problems within the michigan market structure primarily electric customer choice and the need to adjust rates for each customer class to reflect the full cost of service 

concurrently we will move forward in our efforts to continue to improve performance looking forward additional issues such as rising prices for coal health care and higher levels of capital spending will result in us taking meaningful action to address our costs while continuing to provide quality customer service we will utilize the dte energy operating system and the performance excellence process to seek opportunities to improve productivity remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

long term we will be required to invest an estimated 24 billion on emission controls through 2018 should we be able to recover these costs in future rate cases we may experience a growth in earnings 

additionally our service territory may require additional generation capacity a new baseload generating plant has not been built within the state of michigan in the last 20 years should our regulatory environment be conducive to such a significant capital expenditure we may build or expand a new base load coal or nuclear facility while we have not decided on construction of a new baseload nuclear facility in february 2007 we announced that we will prepare a license application for construction and operation of a new nuclear power plant on the site of fermi 2 by completing the license application before the end of 2008 we may qualify for financial incentives under the federal energy policy act of 2005 we are also studying the possible transfer of a gasfired peaking electric generating plant from our nonutility operations to our electric utility to support future power generation requirements 

the following variables either in combination or acting alone could impact our future results 

 

we expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk due to the electric customer choice program until the issues associated with this program are adequately addressed we will accrue as regulatory assets any future unrecovered generationrelated fixed costs stranded costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation and mpsc orders we cannot predict the outcome of these matters see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in january 2007 the mpsc submitted the state of michigan’s 21 st century energy plan to the governor of michigan the plan recommends that michigan’s future energy needs be met through a combination of 

renewable resources and cleanest generating technology with significant energy savings achieved by increased energy efficiency the plan also recommends 

 

we continue to review the energy plan and are unable to predict the impact on the company of the implementation of the plan 

gas utility 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens fuel gas company citizens natural gas utilities subject to regulation by the mpsc michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million residential commercial and industrial customers in the state of michigan michcon also has subsidiaries involved in the gathering and transmission of natural gas in northern michigan michcon operates one of the largest natural gas distribution and transmission systems in the united states citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan to approximately 17000 customers 

factors impacting income gas utility’s net income increased 13 million in 2006 and increased 17 million in 2005 the variances were primarily attributable to increased rates and the impacts in 2005 of the mpsc’s april 2005 gas cost recovery and gas rate orders and the effect of milder weather in 2006 

the 2005 mpsc gas rate order disallowed recovery of 90 of the costs of a computer billing system that was in place prior to dte energy’s acquisition of mcn energy in 2001 michcon impaired this asset by approximately 42 million in the first quarter of 2005 this disallowance was not reflected at the dte energy level since this impairment was previously reserved at the time of the mcn acquisition in 2001 

 

gross margin increased 44 million and 37 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively gross margins were favorably affected by higher base rate revenues of 15 million and 42 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively revenue associated with the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism authorized by the mpsc in the april 2005 gas rate order increased 22 million and 11 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally 2006 was impacted by a 17 million favorable impact in lost gas recognized and an increase of 24 million in midstream services including storage and transportation partially offsetting these increases were declines of 31 million due to warmer than normal weather and 26 million as a result of customer conservation and lower volumes the comparability of 2006 to 2005 is also affected 

by an adjustment we recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to an april 2005 mpsc order in our 2002 gcr reconciliation case that disallowed 26 million representing unbilled revenues at december 2001 

 

the 2005 final rate order provided revenue for an uncollectible expense trueup mechanism uetm to mitigate the effect of increasing uncollectible expense the revenue recorded related to the uetm was 33 million for 2006 and 11 million for 2005 

uncollectible accounts expense 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 7 million and 21 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 increase is due to a 14 million increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices continued weak economic conditions and inadequate governmentsponsored assistance for lowincome customers in 2006 we recorded 24 million in implementation costs associated with our performance excellence process and we recognized 9 million of lower injuries and damages expenses and lower labor and employee incentives the comparability of 2006 to 2005 and the comparability of 2005 to 2004 was affected by an adjustment we recorded in the second quarter of 2005 for the disallowance of 11 million in environmental costs due to the april 2005 final gas rate order and the requirement to defer negative pension expense as a regulatory liability additionally the comparability was impacted by the dte energy parent company no longer allocating 9 million of mergerrelated interest to michcon effective in april 2005 

asset gains and losses net increased 4 million and decreased 7 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 change was due to a 3 million gain on the sale of investment rights related to storage field construction which was offset by a 3 million loss due to a reduction to michcon’s 2004 gcr underrecovery related to the accounting treatment of the injected base gas remaining in the new haven storage field when it was sold in early 2004 the 7 million decline in 2005 was primarily the result of a writeoff of certain computer equipment and related depreciation resulting from the april 2005 final rate order 

income tax provision increased by 13 million in 2006 and income tax benefit decreased 7 million in 2005 primarily due to variations in pretax earnings 

outlook — operating results are expected to vary due to regulatory proceedings weather changes in economic conditions customer conservation and process improvements higher gas prices and economic conditions have resulted in continued pressure on receivables and working capital requirements that are partially mitigated by the gcr mechanism in the april 2005 final gas rate order the mpsc adopted michcon’s proposed tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable each year michcon will file an application comparing its actual uncollectible expense for the prior calendar year to its designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million ninety percent of the difference will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 

we will utilize the dte energy operating system and the performance excellence process to seek opportunities to improve productivity remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

nonutility operations 

coal and gas midstream 

coal and gas midstream consists of coal transportation and marketing and the pipelines processing and storage businesses 

coal transportation and marketing provides fuel transportation and rail equipment management services we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers additionally we participate in coal marketing and coaltopower tolling transactions as well as the purchase and sale of emissions credits we perform coal mine methane extraction in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines industrial users or for small power generation projects 

pipelines processing and storage owns a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline six carbon dioxide processing facilities and two natural gas storage fields the pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by stable longterm fixed price revenue contracts the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations pursuant to an operating agreement michcon provides 

physical operations maintenance and technical support for the washington 28 and washington 10 storage facilities 

factors impacting income  net income increased 5 million and 12 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

operating revenues remained the same in 2006 and increased 118 million in 2005 in 2006 our coal transportation and marketing business experienced lower synfuel related volumes which were offset by an increase in storage revenues in the pipelines processing and storage business during 2005 our coal transportation and marketing business experienced higher throughput volumes and increased prices for coal 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 25 million in 2006 and increased 111 million in 2005  the 2006 decrease was due to lower synfuel related volumes and decreased expenses at our coal transportation and marketing business due to decreased marketing volume during 2005 our coal transportation and marketing business experienced higher throughput volumes and increased prices for coal 

other income and deductions decreased 12 million in 2006 and increased 8 million in 2005 the 2006 decrease is primarily attributed to higher interest expense as a result of our storage expansion construction 

income tax provision increased 6 million for 2006 and increased 3 million in 2005 reflecting variations in pretax income 

outlook — we expect to continue to grow our coal transportation and marketing business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments however a portion of our coal transportation and marketing revenues and net income are dependent upon our synfuel operations and were adversely impacted by the temporary idling of the synfuel facilities in 2006 coal transportation and marketing is involved in a contract dispute with bnsf railway company that has been referred to arbitration see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our pipeline processing and storage business will continue its steady growth plan in april 2006 pipelines processing and storage placed into service over 14 bcf of storage capacity at an existing michigan storage field and plans to file a mpsc application early in 2007 for a new gas storage reservoir which will increase its overall working gas storage capacity by 80 bcf to a total of 74 bcf in december 2006 washington 28 filed an application with the mpsc requesting an increase in its working gas storage capacity to 160 bcf vector pipeline has secured longterm market commitments to support an expansion project for approximately 200 mmcf per day with a projected inservice date of november 2007 vector pipeline received ferc approval for this expansion in october 2006 pipeline processing and storage has a 2625 ownership interest in millennium pipeline which received ferc approval for construction and operation in december 2006 millennium pipeline is scheduled to be in service in late 2008 in october 2006 we purchased the lessor interest in the 66 bcf washington 10 gas storage field prior to the purchase we leased the storage rights and lease obligations 

were recorded as operating leases we plan to expand existing assets and develop new assets which are typically supported with longterm customer commitments 

unconventional gas production 

unconventional gas production is primarily engaged in natural gas exploration development and production our unconventional gas production business produces gas from the antrim and barnett shales and sells most of the gas to the energy trading segment 

factors impacting income  net income increased 5 million in 2006 and decreased 2 million in 2005 the 2006 results were primarily impacted by an increase in barnett shale production and an increase in net gas prices for antrim shale partially offsetting these revenue increases were higher operating and depletion expenses associated with increased production and the operation of new wells the decline in 2005 was due to higher operating and michigan severance tax expenses 

 

operating revenues increased 25 million in 2006 due to increased barnett shale production and increased 3 million in 2005 due primarily to higher gas prices 

operation and maintenance expense increased 7 million in 2006 and 3 million in 2005 increases are associated with the addition of approximately 285 net producing wells during the threeyear period 

depreciation depletion and amortization increased 7 million in 2006 and 2 million in 2005 the yeartoyear increases were associated with higher gas production and higher finding costs associated with barnett shale wells 

taxes other than income were the same in 2006 due to severance taxes that were impacted by lower gas prices which was offset by higher gas production and increased 4 million in 2005 due to higher severance taxes associated with gas price increases on relatively flat antrim gas volumes 

assets gains and losses net increased 3 million in 2006 primarily due to the sale of a working interest in unproved property 

other income and deductions increased 5 million in 2006 and decreased 2 million in 2005 interest expense was the primary contributor to the variances the 2006 increase in interest expense was attributed to higher average affiliate notes payable balances 

outlook — we expect to continue to develop our proved areas and test unproved areas in michigan and texas evaluation of barnett shale test wells in up to three new areas is ongoing during 2007 we expect barnett shale production of 87 bcfe of natural gas compared with approximately 41 bcfe in 2006 and antrim shale production roughly equivalent to the 215 bcfe produced in 2006 we expect to invest a combined amount of approximately 150 million to 170 million in our unconventional gas production business in 2007 we are exploring the sale of a portion of our unconventional gas production assets 

which will allow us to monetize value from our more mature holdings while retaining the ability to benefit from the upside of our earlier stage holdings 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver utilitytype services to industrial commercial and institutional customers and biomass energy projects we provide utilitytype services using project assets usually located on the customers’ premises in the steel automotive pulp and paper airport and other industries these services include pulverized coal and petroleum coke supply power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply we own and operate three gasfired peaking electric generating plants and a biomassfired electric generating plant and operate one additional gasfired power plant under contract additionally we own a gasfired peaking electric generating plant that was taken out of service in september 2006 we develop own and operate landfill gas recovery systems throughout the united states we produce metallurgical coke from two coke batteries the production of coke from our coke batteries generates production tax credits 

factors impacting income  power and industrial projects’ reported a net loss of 80 million in 2006 and net income of 4 million in 2005 the 2006 net loss is primarily due to impairments the 2005 net income is attributed to the acquisitions of four onsite energy projects and coke operations in 2005 

 

operating revenues decreased 19 million in 2006 and 20 million in 2005 the 2006 decrease is primarily due to lower coke prices and lower pulverized coal sales the 2005 decrease reflects the impact from the sale of our interest in a coke battery in 2005 offset by increases at another owned coke battery due to increased output and increased prices the 2006 and 2005 decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from our onsite energy projects reflecting the addition of new facilities completion of new longterm utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large manufacturer of paper products 

operation and maintenance expense increased 37 million in 2006 and decreased 55 million in 2005 reflecting the 2005 acquisitions of three onsite energy projects and coke operations the 2005 decrease reflects the impact from the sale of an interest in a coke battery in 2005 resulting in a decrease in expense offset by increases in costs at another owned coke battery reflecting increased output 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net increased 76 million in 2006 in 2006 we recorded a 42 million impairment for one of our 100 owned natural gasfired generating plants and a 14 million impairment at our landfill gas recovery unit relating to the writedown of longlived assets at several landfill sites also during 2006 we recorded a pretax impairment loss of 19 million for the write down of fixed assets and patents at our waste coal recovery business 

other income and deductions increased 39 million in 2006 primarily due to a 32 million impairment of a 50 equity interest in a natural gasfired generating plant 

income taxes declined 49 million in 2006 and increased 12 million in 2005 reflecting changes in pretax income 

outlook – power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy business the coke battery and landfill gas recovery businesses generate production tax credits that are subject to an oil pricerelated phaseout due to the relatively low level of production tax credits generated by our coke battery and landfill gas recovery business a partial or full phaseout of production tax credits in these two businesses is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations cash flow and financial position we are exploring the combination of a sale of an equity interest in and recapitalization of some of the assets of the power and industrial projects business including the sale or restructuring of the power generation assets in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell our georgetown peaking electric generating facility the sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2007

energy trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants and the optimization of contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies large industrials and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines energy trading is integral in providing commodity risk management services to the other unregulated businesses within dte energy 

factors impacting income  net income increased 139 million in 2006 and decreased 128 million in 2005 the 2006 increase is attributed to increased marktomarket and realized power and gas positions that resulted from significant 2005 marktomarket losses on derivative contracts used to economically hedge our gas in storage and forward power contracts the 2005 decrease is attributed to decreased marktomarket and realized power and gas positions 

 

gross margin increased 221 million in 2006 and decreased 186 million in 2005 the 2006 increase is attributed to a 168 million marktomarket increase on power and gas positions and a 57 million increase in realized power and gas positions the 2006 results reflect the timing differences from 2005 that largely reversed and favorably impacted earnings the 2005 decrease is due to a 121 million marktomarket decrease on power and gas positions and a 66 million decrease in realized power and gas positions the 2005 results reflect the economically favorable decision in early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas 

operation and maintenance expense increased 22 million in 2006 and 2 million in 2005 the 2006 increases were due to higher incentive expenses of 14 million resulting from our strong economic performance and higher corporate allocation charges of 10 million 

other income and deductions decreased 16 million in 2006 and increased 8 million in 2005 the 2006 decrease is attributed to 6 million of lower intercompany interest expense and 8 million of higher intercompany interest income resulting from favorable operating cash flows to fund intercompany loans 

income tax provision increased 72 million in 2006 and decreased 68 million in 2005 primarily due to variations in pretax earnings 

outlook  significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as capacity positions of natural gas storage and pipelines and power transmission contracts the financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the owned gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative assets the majority of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle which does not coincide with the calendar and fiscal year but runs annually from april of one year to march of the next year our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of storage with overthecounter forwards and futures this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods we are exploring strategic options for the energy trading business 

see “fair value of contracts” section that follows 

synthetic fuel 

synthetic fuel is comprised of the nine synfuel plants that we operate and that produce synthetic fuel the production of synthetic fuel from the synfuel plants generates production tax credits 

factors impacting income  synthetic fuel net income decreased 257 million in 2006 and increased 106 million in 2005 the decline in 2006 was due to higher oil prices resulting in reduced gains from selling interests in our synfuel plants lower levels of production tax credits and asset impairments and reserves the increase in 2005 reflects higher gains recognized from selling interests in our synfuel plants gains on synfuel hedges and increased levels of production tax credits 

 

operating revenues decreased 64 million in 2006 and increased 277 million in 2005 revenues were lower in 2006 due to our decision to temporarily idle production at all nine of the synfuel facilities revenues increased in 2005 primarily reflecting higher synfuel sales due to increased production 

operation and maintenance expense decreased 148 million in 2006 and increased 335 million in 2005 operation and maintenance expense declined in 2006 due to our decision to temporarily idle production at 

all nine of the synfuel facilities for a portion of the year operating and maintenance expense in 2005 increased reflecting costs associated with increased synthetic fuel production 

asset gains and losses reserves and impairments net decreased 407 million in 2006 and increased 148 million in 2005 in 2006 and 2005 we deferred gains from the sale of the synfuel facilities including in 2006 a portion of gains related to fixed payments due to the increase in oil prices and the resulting decrease in production and sales volumes we recorded an accrual for contractual partners’ obligations of 79 million pretax in 2006 reflecting the possible refund of amounts equal to our partners’ capital contributions or for operating losses that would normally be paid by our partners we recorded other synfuelrelated reserves and impairments in 2006 of 78 million to economically hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices and the resulting reduction in synfuel sales proceeds we entered into derivative and other contracts the derivative contracts are markedtomarket with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains we recorded net 2006 synfuel hedge marktomarket gains of 60 million compared with net 2005 synfuel hedge marktomarket gains of 47 million in 2004 we recorded mark tomarket losses of 12 million see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 minority interest decreased 67 million in 2006 and increased 95 million in 2005 reflecting our partners’ share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations as well as our partners’ 70 million share of the asset impairment in 2006 the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during prior periods resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our partners 

income taxes declined 105 million in 2006 and increased 33 million in 2005 reflecting changes in pretax income due to synfuel related loss reserves and the impairment of fixed assets compared to pretax income in 2005 

outlook – due to the implementation of our hedging strategy we expect to continue to operate the synfuel plants through december 31 2007 when synfuelrelated production tax credits expire 

corporate  other 

corporate  other includes various corporate staff functions as these functions support the entire company their costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized therefore the effect of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year additionally corporate  other holds certain nonutility debt assets held for sale and energyrelated investments 

factors impacting income  corporate  other results declined by 9 million in 2006 and declined 40 million in 2005 the 2006 decline was primarily due to higher michigan single business taxes the 2005 decline was primarily a result of the parent company not allocating merger interest to detroit edison and michcon partially offsetting 2005 increased expenses were reduced michigan single business taxes and gains on the sale of nonstrategic assets 

discontinued operations 

dte georgetown georgetown  — we own georgetown an 80 mw natural gasfired peaking electric generating plant in the fourth quarter of 2006 management approved the marketing of georgetown for sale in december 2006 georgetown met the sfas no 144 criteria of an asset “held for sale” and we reported its operating results as a discontinued operation we did not recognize an impairment loss since the carrying value of georgetown’s assets less costs to sell approximated its fair value in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell our georgetown peaking electric generating facility the sale is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2007 

dte energy technologies dtech  we own dtech which assembled marketed distributed and serviced distributed generation products provided application engineering and monitored and managed onsite generation system operations in july 2005 management approved the restructuring of this business resulting in the identification of certain assets and liabilities to be sold or abandoned primarily associated with standby and continuous duty generation sales and service we recognized a net of tax restructuring loss of 23 million during the third quarter of 2005 primarily representing the write down to fair value of the assets of dtech less costs to sell and the writeoff of goodwill as we execute the restructuring plan there may be adjustments to amounts recorded related to the impairment and exit costs 

southern missouri gas company smgc  we owned smgc a public utility engaged in the distribution transmission and sale of natural gas in southern missouri in the first quarter of 2004 management approved the marketing of smgc for sale as of march 31 2004 smgc met the criteria of an asset “held for sale” and we have reported its operating results as a discontinued operation we recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately 7 million representing the writedown to fair value of the assets of smgc less costs to sell and the writeoff of allocated goodwill in november 2004 we entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of smgc regulatory approval was received in april 2005 and the sale closed in may 2005 during the second quarter of 2005 we recognized a net of tax gain of 2 million 

international transmission company itc  in february 2003 we sold itc our electric transmission business to affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co and trimaran capital partners llc through december 31 2004 we recorded a gain of 58 million net of tax during the second quarter of 2005 the gain was adjusted to 56 million net of tax 

see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cumulative effect of accounting changes 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment using the modified prospective transition method the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas 123r was an increase in net income of 1 million as a result of estimating forfeitures for previously granted stock awards and performance shares 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 143 that required additional new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2005 earnings by 3 million 

capital resources and liquidity 

cash requirements 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2007 of up to 14 billion the capital needs 

of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures we may spend an additional 125 million on growthrelated projects within our nonutility businesses in 2007 

capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2007 primarily as a result of environmental spending we anticipate environmental expenditures of approximately 253 million in 2007 and up to approximately 23 billion of future capital expenditures to satisfy both existing and proposed new requirements 

we expect nonutility capital spending will approximate 300 million to 400 million annually for the next several years capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

debt maturing in 2007 totals approximately 346 million 

we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital requirements 

 

cash from operating activities 

a majority of the company’s operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs our nonutility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise primarily from the synthetic fuels business which we believe subject to considerations discussed below will provide up to approximately 900 million of cash during 20072009 

cash from operations totaling 15 billion in 2006 was up 455 million from the comparable 2005 period the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of 352 million in net income after adjusting for 

noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains and a 103 million decrease in working capital and other requirements most of the improvement was driven by higher net income at detroit edison which was the result of improved revenues and gross margin stemming from a full year of higher rates granted in the 2004 rate orders and lower customer choice penetration the working capital improvement was driven by michcon which resulted primarily from declining gcr factors which had the effect of lowering customer accounts receivable balances this improvement was partially offset by working capital requirements at detroit edison which resulted from pension and veba contributions totaling 271 million in 2006 

cash from operations totaling 10 billion in 2005 was up 6 million from the comparable 2004 period the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over 83 million in net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains substantially offset by a 77 million increase in working capital and other requirements most of the improvement was driven by higher net income at detroit edison which was the result of improved revenues and gross margin stemming from higher rates granted in the 2004 rate orders warmer weather and lower customer choice penetration the offsetting increase in working capital requirements was driven by a 127 million pscr underrecovery in 2005 as compared to a 112 million overrecovery in 2004 working capital requirements also reflect the higher cost of gas at michcon and our energy trading segment michcon’s working capital and other requirements were 136 million higher in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher gas costs this impact was reflected by accounts receivable balances that were 198 million higher at december 31 2005 than the previous year at michcon the increase in working capital requirements was mitigated by lower income tax payments in 2005 and company initiatives to improve cash flow including better inventory management cash sales transactions and the utilization of letters of credit 

outlook — we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily due to improvements from higher earnings at our utilities we are incurring costs associated with implementation of our performance excellence process but we expect to realize sustained net cost savings beginning in 2007 we also may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our pscr and gcr costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of mpsc orders gas prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives 

we anticipate approximately 900 million of synfuelrelated cash impacts from 2007 through 2009 which consists of cash from operations and proceeds from option hedges and approximately 500 million of tax credit carryforward utilization and other tax benefits that are expected to reduce future tax payments the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet we expect to use any such cash and the potential cash from monetization of certain of our nonutility assets and operations to reduce debt and repurchase common stock and to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria we repurchased one million shares of common stock in december 2006 our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios to improve our current credit rating and outlook and to have any monetization be accretive to earnings per share 

cash from investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements capital spending within our nonutility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we invest tentatively based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be 

determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

net cash outflows relating to investing activities increased 392 million in 2006 compared to 2005 the 2006 change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures the increase in capital expenditures was driven by environmental enterprise business systems development and distribution projects at detroit edison pipeline reliability and inventory management projects at michcon and growthoriented projects across our nonutility segments 

net cash outflows relating to investing activities increased 121 million in 2005 the increase was primarily due to increased capital expenditures partially offset by higher synfuel proceeds spending on growth project investments increased 123 million in 2005 while spending on environmental projects was 44 million higher than the 2004 period 

longer term with the expected improvement at our utilities and assuming continued cash generation from the synfuel business cash flows are expected to improve we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

cash from financing activities 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by the company’s operations shortterm borrowings which are mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 to 52 to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our longterm debt and strengthening our balance sheet the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs 

net cash used for financing activities increased 36 million during 2006 compared to 2005 due mostly to a decrease in shortterm borrowings and issuance of common stock and longterm debt partially offset by a decrease in debt redemptions 

net cash used for financing activities improved 145 million in 2005 due primarily to the issuance of common stock which resulted from the conversion of our equity security units 

see notes 11 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in august 2006 dte energy and detroit edison filed a combined shelf registration statement for the issuance of securities in an unlimited amount for three years from its effective date michcon has a separate effective registration statement providing for the issuance of 200 million of securities 

common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash in january 2005 we announced that the dte energy board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 700 million in common stock through 2008 the authorization provides company management with flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time and will depend on future cash flows and investment opportunities we repurchased one million shares of our common stock in december 2006 we also contributed 170 million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of 2004 in august 2005 we issued 37 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the settlement of the stock purchase component of our equity security units 

contractual obligations 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities management believes that the current credit ratings of the company provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to the company may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various nonutility subsidiaries in the event that our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately 383 million at december 31 2006 additionally upon a downgrade our trading business could be required to restrict operations and our access to the shortterm commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating agencies all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities 

 

critical accounting estimates 

there are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment such estimates relate to regulation risk management and trading activities production tax credits goodwill pension and postretirement costs the allowance for doubtful accounts and legal and tax reserves 

regulation 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of our businesses 

if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no 71 on all our operations we estimate that the extraordinary loss would be as follows 

 

 

 management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

risk management and trading activities 

all derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as “assets or 1iabilities from risk management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended 

the offsetting entry to “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge accounting the fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each reporting period for changes using market sources such as 

 

market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective transparent prices can be obtained unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this criterion 

production tax credits 

we generate production tax credits from our synfuel coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations we recognize earnings as tax credits are generated at our facilities in one of two ways first to the extent we have sold an interest in our synfuel facilities to third parties we recognize gains as synfuel is produced and sold and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable when probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is reasonably assured second to the extent we generate credits to our own account we recognize earnings through reduced tax expense 

all production tax credits are subject to audit by the irs however all of our synfuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations audits of five of our synfuel facilities were successfully completed in the past two years if production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be a significant writeoff of previously recorded earnings from such tax credits 

tax credits generated by our facilities were 295 million in 2006 as compared to 617 million in 2005 and 449 million in 2004 the portion of tax credits generated for our own account was 35 million in 2006 as compared to 55 million in 2005 and 38 million in 2004 with the remaining credits generated allocated to third party partners 

goodwill 

certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in order to perform these impairment tests we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation techniques which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

as of december 31 2006 our goodwill totaled 21 billion the majority of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units the value of the utility reporting units may be significantly impacted by rate orders and the regulatory environment 

we also have 4 million of goodwill allocated to the synthetic fuel reporting unit the value of the synthetic fuel reporting unit has been impacted by the anticipated phaseout of tax credits as of december 31 2006 we have evaluated the impact of a phaseout of synfuel tax credits on our valuation assumptions we have determined that the fair value of the synthetic fuel reporting unit exceeds the carrying value and no impairment of goodwill exists these assumptions may change as the value of the synfuel tax credits change 

during 2005 we recorded an impairment of 16 million to goodwill related to discontinuing the operations of dtech 

based on our 2006 goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of our remaining operating reporting units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed we will continue to monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections 

pension and postretirement costs 

our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors including rates of return on plan assets the discount rate the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions 

we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of 125 million in 2006 including special termination benefits of 49 million 90 million in 2005 and 81 million in 2004 postretirement benefits costs for all plans were 197 million in 2006 including special termination benefits of 8 million 155 million in 2005 and 125 million in 2004 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2006 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 875 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated input from our consultants including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity and bond markets our 2007 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 65 in equity markets 20 in fixed income markets and 15 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe that 875 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2007 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded we have unrecognized net gains due to the performance of the financial markets as of december 31 2006 we had 39 million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased from 59 at december 31 2005 to 57 at december 31 2006 due to recent company contributions financial market performance and lower discount rates we estimate that our 2007 pension costs will approximate 66 million excluding special termination benefits compared to 85 million excluding special termination benefits in 2006 and our 2007 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 184 million compared to 189 million excluding special termination benefits of 8 million in 2006 in the last several years we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design additionally future pension costs for detroit edison will be affected by a pension tracking mechanism which was authorized by the mpsc in its november 2004 rate order the tracking mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in detroit edison’s base rates in april 2005 the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of michcon’s negative pension expense michcon will record a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2006 qualified pension costs by approximately 22 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2006 pension costs by approximately 10 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by onepercentagepoint would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2006 by approximately 25 million 

the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the financial markets the value of our plan assets was 33 billion at december 31 2004 and november 30 2005 the value at november 30 2006 was 35 billion the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional minimum pension liability an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders’ equity in 2004 and 2005 at december 31 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 that required us to recognize the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement plans the impact of the adoption of sfas 158 was an increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities of approximately 13 billion we requested and received agreement from the mpsc to record the additional liability amounts for the detroit edison and michcon benefit plans on the statement of financial position as a regulatory asset as a result regulatory assets were increased by approximately 12 billion the remainder of the increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without substantial returns in the financial markets we made a 170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in 2004 we did not make pension contributions in 2005 and made a 180 million cash contribution in 2006 at the discretion of management we anticipate making up to a 180 million contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2007 and up to 600 million over the next five years also we anticipate making up to a 15 million contribution to our nonqualified benefit plans in 2007 and up to 35 million over the next five years we contributed 80 million to our postretirement plans in 2004 we did not contribute to our postretirement plans in 2005 and made a 116 million contribution to our postretirement benefit plans in 2006 at the discretion of management we anticipate making up to a 116 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2007 and up to 580 million over the next five years 

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act was signed into law this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law the effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced costs by 17 million in 2006 20 million in 2005 and 16 million in 2004 

see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers historical trends economic conditions age of receivables and other information higher customer bills due to increased gas prices the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2005 and 2006 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates as part of the 2005 rate order for michcon the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible accounts tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in light of rising energy prices would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 

legal and tax reserves 

we are involved in various legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the company tax reserves are based upon management’s assessment of potential adjustments to tax positions taken we regularly review ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience in addition to current tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments 

environmental matters 

protecting the environment as well as correcting past environmental damage continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators legislation andor rulemaking could further impact the electric utility 

industry including detroit edison the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to cleanup contaminated property 

electric utility 

air  detroit edison is subject to epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in march 2005 epa issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements detroit edison has spent approximately 875 million through 2006 we estimate detroit edison will incur future capital expenditures of up to 222 million in 2007 and up to 2 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements 

the epa has ongoing enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison in october 2003 the epa promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review provisions going forward several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and in december 2003 a stay was issued until the us court of appeals dc circuit renders an opinion in the case we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison 

we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address the climate change issue there may be legislative action to address the issue of changes in climate that result from the build up of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere we cannot predict the impact any legislative action may have on the company 

water – in response to an epa regulation currently under judicial review detroit edison may be required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of the studies to be conducted over the next several years detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes initially we estimated that we will incur up to approximately 53 million over the next three to five years in additional capital expenditures to comply with these requirements however a recent court decision remanded back to the epa several provisions of the federal regulation which may result in a delay in compliance requirements the court decision also raised the possibility that the company may have to install cooling towers at some facilities we cannot predict the effect on detroit edison of this court decision or any resulting regulations 

contaminated sites  detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including two former mgp sites the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations we have a reserve balance of 11 million as of december 31 2006 for the remediation of these sites over the next several years in addition detroit edison expects to make approximately 5 million of capital improvements to the ash landfill in 2007 

gas utility 

contaminated sites  prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil gas utility owns or previously owned 15 former mgp sites investigations have revealed contamination related to the by–products of gas manufacturing at each site in addition to the mpg sites gas utility is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years as a result of these determinations we have recorded liabilities of 41 million and 1 million for the mgps and other contaminated sites respectively it is estimated that gas utility may incur 5 million in expenses related to cleanup costs in 2007 

in 1993 a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism was approved by the mpsc for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former mgp sites in excess of this reserve after a study was completed in 1995 gas utility accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of 35 million during 2006 we spent approximately 2 million investigating and remediating these former mgp sites in december 2006 we retained multiple environmental consultants to estimate the project cost to remediate each mgp site we accrued an additional 7 million in remediation liabilities associated with former mgp holders and additional cleanup cost to increase the reserve balance to 41 million as of december 31 2006 

any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and thereby affect the company’s financial position and cash flows however we anticipate the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the mpsc will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

other 

our nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we are in the process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facility in michigan we expect the project to be completed within one year our nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 

various state and federal laws regulate our handling storage and disposal of waste materials the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property we have extensive land holdings and from time to time must investigate claims of improperly disposed contaminants we anticipate our utility and nonutility companies may periodically be included in various types of environmental proceedings 

enterprise business systems 

in 2003 we began the development of our enterprise business systems ebs project an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems relating to finance human resources supply chain and work management as part of this initiative we are implementing ebs software including among others products developed by sap ag and mro software inc the first phase of implementation occurred in 2005 in the regulated electric fossil generation unit additional phases of implementation are planned for 2007 the conversion of data and the implementation and operation of the ebs will be continuously monitored and reviewed and should ultimately strengthen our internal control structure and lead to increased cost efficiencies although our implementation plan includes detailed testing and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and successful transition we can provide no assurance that complications will not arise that could interrupt our operations 

we have spent approximately 330 million through the end of 2006 and expect total spending over the life of the project to be between 375 million and 400 million we expect the benefits of lower costs faster business cycles repeatable and optimized processes enhanced internal controls improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs to outweigh the expense of our investment in this initiative 

miso 

the miso was formed in 1996 by its member transmission owners and in december 2001 received ferc approval as a regional transmission organization rto authorized to provide regional transmission services as prescribed by ferc in its order 2000 order 2000 requires an rto to perform eight functions including tariff administration transmission system congestion management provision of ancillary services to support transmission operations market monitoring interregional coordination and 

the coordination of system planning and expansion miso’s independence from ownership of either generation or transmission facilities is intended to enable it to ensure fair access to the transmission grid and through its congestion management role miso is also charged with ensuring grid reliability miso’s initial provision of transmission services in december 2001 was known as day 1 operations 

in keeping with order 2000 which permits rtos to provide realtime energy imbalance services and a marketbased mechanism for congestion management miso on april 1 2005 launched its midwest energy market or day 2 operations and began regional wholesale electric market operations and transmission service throughout its area a key feature of the midwest energy market is the establishment of locational marginal prices lmps which provide price transparency for the sale and purchase of wholesale electricity at different locations in the market territory the lmp is the market clearing price at a specific pricing location in the midwest energy market that is equal to the cost of supplying the next increment of load at that location the value of an lmp is the same whether a purchase or sale is made at that location detroit edison participates in the midwest energy market by offering its generation on a dayahead and real time basis and by bidding for power in the market to serve its load the cost of power procured from the market net of any gain realized from generation sold into the market is included and recovered through the pscr mechanism in addition lmps are expected to encourage new generation to locate where the power produced is of most value to the load and is expected to identify where new transmission facilities are needed to relieve grid congestion 

miso is compensated for assuring grid reliability and for supporting the energy market through fercapproved rates charged to load detroit edison became a nontransmission owning member of miso in compliance with section 10w 1 of pa 141 the mpsc has ordered that miso costs charged to detroit edison should be recovered through the pscr mechanism 

federal energy policy act of 2005 

in august 2005 the energy policy act of 2005 energy act was signed into law among other provisions the energy act 

 

the implementation of the energy act requires proceedings at the state level and development of regulations by the ferc as well as other federal agencies the impact of the energy act on our results of operations will depend on the implementation of final rules and cannot be fully determined at this time 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

fair value of contracts 

the following disclosures provide enhanced transparency of the derivative activities and position of our trading businesses and our other businesses 

we use the criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted to determine if certain contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments the rules for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex moreover significant judgment is required to 

determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently if a contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument it is recorded in the financial statements as “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” at the fair value of the contract the recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted quarterly to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract a practice known as marktomarket mtm accounting 

fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an armslength transaction to determine the fair value of contracts accounted for as derivative instruments we use a combination of quoted market prices and mathematical valuation models valuation models require various inputs including forward prices volatility interest rates and exercise periods 

contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments are power gas and oil forwards futures options and swaps as well as foreign currency contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives and which are therefore excluded from the following tables include gas inventory gas storage and transportation arrangements fullrequirements power contracts and gas and oil reserves as subsequently discussed we have fully reserved the value of derivative contracts beyond the liquid trading timeframe thereby not impacting income 

the subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating characteristics and key risks 

 

rollforward of marktomarket energy contract net assets 

the following tables provide details on changes in our marktomarket net asset or liability position during 2006 

 

 

 the following table provides a current and noncurrent analysis of “assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities” as reflected on the consolidated statement of financial position as of december 31 2006 amounts that relate to contracts that become due within twelve months are classified as current and all remaining amounts are classified as noncurrent 

 

maturity of fair value of mtm energy contract net assets 

we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe our intent is to recognize mtm activity only when pricing data is obtained from active quotes and published indexes actively quoted and published indexes include exchange traded ie nymex and overthecounter positions for which broker quotes are available although the nymex has currently quoted prices for the next 72 months broker quotes for gas and power are generally available for 18 and 24 months into the future respectively we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact income 

as a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles the tables above do not include the expected favorable earnings impacts of certain nonderivative gas storage and power contracts we entered into economically favorable transactions in early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price 

for natural gas we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in storage in addition we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts we expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will be fully realized by the end of 2007 

the table below shows the maturity of our mtm positions 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

dte energy has commodity price risk in both utility and nonutility businesses arising from market price fluctuations 

the electric and gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal natural gas uranium electricity and base metals to meet their service obligations further changes in the price of electricity can impact the level of exposure of customer choice programs and uncollectible expenses at the electric utility in addition changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost gas storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the gas utility 

to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations the utility businesses have applied various approaches to manage this risk the approaches include forward energy capacity storage and futures contracts as well as regulatory raterecovery mechanisms regulatory raterecovery occurs in the form of pscr and gcr mechanisms see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and a tracking mechanism to mitigate some losses from customer migration due to electric customer choice programs 

the nonutility businesses have risk in conjunction with electricity natural gas crude oil and coal 

our power and industrial projects and synthetic fuel segments are subject to crude oil electricity natural gas and coal based product price risk as previously discussed production tax credits generated by dte energy’s synfuel coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations are subject to phaseout if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels the benefits associated with tax credits may be subject to changes in federal tax law also we have entered into a series of derivative contracts for 2007 to economically hedge the impact of oil prices on a portion of our synfuel cash flow see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements to limit our exposure to the other commodities we use forward energy capacity and futures contracts 

our unconventional gas production business segment has exposure to natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil price fluctuations these commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations to manage this exposure we use forward energy and futures contracts 

our energy trading business segment has exposure to electricity natural gas and crude oil price fluctuations these risks are managed through its energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy capacity storage and futures contracts within predetermined risk parameters 

our coal and gas midstream business segment has exposure to natural gas and coal price fluctuations these coal price risks are managed primarily through its coal transportation and marketing operations through the use of forward coal and futures contracts the gas midstream business unit manages its exposure through the sale of longterm storage and transportation contracts 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

we purchase and sell electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail and other industries certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the u s bankruptcy code we regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss we believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

other 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations

energy trading 

we are exposed to credit risk through trading activities credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations we utilize both external and internally generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2006 the company has a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately 18 excluding securitized debt 

foreign currency risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations we have entered into a series of currency forward contracts through january 2011 additionally we may enter into fair value currency hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2006 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values 

the results of the sensitivity analysis calculations follow

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

dte energy is a growing and diversified energy company with 2005 revenues in excess of 9 billion and approximately 23 billion in assets since 2003 our asset base has increased by 12 and operating revenues have grown by 29 

we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern michigan we operate three energyrelated nonutility segments with operations throughout the united states 

in 2005 our utilities and power and industrial projects segment generated most of our earnings the improvement in earnings was due to rate increases at our michigan utilities favorable weather and continued asset gains from the synthetic fuel business earnings were also impacted by marktomarket losses in our fuel transportation and marketing segment and losses from discontinued operations 

our 2005 financial performance improved over 2004 the following table summarizes our income since 2003 

 

the items discussed below influenced our 2005 financial performance and may affect future results 

 

utility operations 

weather  earnings at our utility operations are seasonal and very sensitive to weather electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utility’s results are dependent on cold winter weather the following table explains the impact of weather relative to 30year historical normal weather temperatures for each utility 

 

 

 the positive impact of warmer weather was partially mitigated by the rate cap on residential customers which prevented us from passing through increased generation and purchased power costs incurred to serve the higher demand additionally we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages restoration and other costs associated with stormrelated power outages lowered pretax earnings by 82 million in 2005 48 million in 2004 and 72 million in 2003 

receivables  both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables especially within our gas utility operations the increase is attributable to economic conditions high natural gas prices and the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers 

we have taken aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables including increased customer disconnections contracting with collection agencies and working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers in 2005 we sold previously writtenoff accounts of 187 million resulting in a gain and net proceeds of 6 million the gain was recorded as a recovery through bad debt expense which is included within operation and maintenance expense as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts expense for the two utilities decreased to 98 million in 2005 from 105 million in 2004 

the april 2005 mpsc gas rate order provided for an uncollectible tracking mechanism for michcon we will file an annual application comparing our actual uncollectible expense to our designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million ninety percent of the difference from the date of the order will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 

electric utility 

electric rate orders — in 2004 the mpsc issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases totaling 374 million eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for electric customer choice customers the increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap the mpsc also authorized the recovery of approximately 385 million in regulatory assets including stranded costs as a result of increased rates our 2005 pretax margins were higher by 116 million 

electric customer choice  our customers have the option of participating in the electric customer choice program where they can select an alternative electric supplier due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial period of electric customer choice many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers the impact of the final rate order in 2004 that increased base rates including the recovery of lost margins and transition charges combined with recent higher wholesale electric prices has resulted in many former electric customer choice customers migrating back to detroit edison for electrical generation service partially mitigating the financial impact of the electric customer choice program 

the return of customers from the electric customer choice program resulted in higher gross margins during 2005 the following graph depicts the electric customer choice volumes 

we continue to work with the mpsc to address issues associated with the electric customer choice program in february 2005 we filed a revenueneutral rate restructuring proposal with the mpsc designed to adjust rates for each customer class to be reflective of the full costs incurred to service such customers in december 2005 the mpsc issued an order that took some initial steps to improve the current competitive imbalance in michigan’s electric customer choice program the december 2005 order establishes costbased power supply rates for detroit edison’s full service customers electric customer choice participants will pay costbased distribution rates while detroit edison’s full service commercial and industrial customers will pay costbased distribution rates that reflect the cost of the residential rate subsidy residential customers pay a subsidized below cost rate for distribution service these revenue neutral revised rates were effective february 1 2006 

coal supply – our generating fleet produces in excess of 70 of its electricity from coal increasing coal demand from domestic and international markets has resulted in significant price increases in addition difficulty in recruiting workers obtaining environmental permits and finding economically recoverable amounts of new coal has resulted in decreasing coal output from the central appalachian region furthermore as a result of environmental regulation and declining eastern coal stocks demand for cleaner burning western coal has increased this increased demand for western coal has also resulted in a corresponding demand for western rail shipping straining railroad capacity resulting in longer lead times for western coal shipments 

uranium supply  we operate one nuclear facility that undergoes a periodic refueling outage approximately every eighteen months uranium prices have been rising due to supply concerns in the future there may be additional nuclear facilities constructed in the industry that may place additional pressure on uranium supplies and prices 

gas utility 

gas final rate order – in april 2005 the mpsc issued a final rate order authorizing michcon to earn a rate of return on common equity of 11 based on a 50 debt and 50 equity capital structure highlights of the order include 

 

the final rate order from the mpsc denied recovery or required accounting impairment for the following items 

 

 

additionally the rate order adjusted michcon’s depreciation rates and the related revenue requirements with no resulting impact on net income 

gas cost recovery order – based on rate orders in place for 2001 and 2002 we filed a gas cost recovery case in 2002 and recorded a 26 million regulatory asset related to unbilled volumes as of december 31 2001 over time we recorded 3 million of interest associated with this regulatory asset in its april 28 2005 order the mpsc disallowed recovery and we recorded the impact of the disallowance in the first quarter of 2005 

natural gas supply – increased demand from natural gas power plants 2005 hurricane related supply disruptions regulatory constraints and limited exploration have combined to strain existing natural gas supplies and caused substantial increases in prices 

nonutility operations 

we anticipate significant investment opportunities within our nonutility businesses we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that will leverage our existing assets skill and expertise specifically we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile assuming no phaseout of production tax credits the source of investment capital is the estimated cumulative 12 billion we anticipate from synfuel cash flow which consists of cash from operations asset sales and the utilization of current and previously earned production tax credits to reduce tax payments tax credit carryforward utilization in part could be extended past 2008 if taxable income is reduced from current forecasts however if oil prices remain at current levels or continue to increase the estimated cash flow from the synfuel business would be significantly less and would adversely impact the success of this strategy unless we identify alternative sources of cash 

power and industrial projects 

we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we closely examine the regulatory environment the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our interrelated businesses as we expand from our current regional focus as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns 

we plan to focus on the following areas for growth 

 

synfuelrelated earnings — we operate nine synthetic fuel production plants throughout the united states synfuel plants chemically change coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code production tax credits are provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal these tax credits expire on december 31 2007 our synthetic fuel plants generate operating losses which are offset by the resulting production tax credits we have not had sufficient taxable income to fully utilize production tax credits earned in prior periods as of december 31 2005 we have 484 million in tax credit carryforwards 

to optimize income and cash flow from our synfuel operations we have sold interests in all nine of our facilities representing 91 of our total production capacity as of december 31 2005 we will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional interests in our two remaining majorityowned plants proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels and the value of such credits when we sell an interest in a synfuel project we recognize the gain as the facility produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in substance we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base 

the value of a production tax credit can vary each year and is adjusted annually by an inflation factor as published by the irs in april of the following year the value of the production tax credit in a given year is reduced if the reference price of oil within the year exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if the reference price exceeds a phaseout price the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil during 2005 the monthly average wellhead prices were approximately 6 lower than the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for light sweet crude oil the actual or estimated reference price and beginning and ending phaseout prices per barrel of oil for 2004 through 2007 are as follows 

 

recent events have increased domestic crude oil prices including hurricanerelated supply disruptions and continued worldwide demand through december 31 2005 the nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil for 2005 averaged approximately 57 which due to the uncertainty of the wellheadnymex difference is comparable to an approximate 51 reference price for the remaining life of the tax credits if the reference price falls within or exceeds the phaseout range the availability of production tax credits in that year would be reduced or eliminated any actual tax credit phaseout for 2006 and available tax credits if any will not be certain until published by the irs in april 2007 as of february 28 2006 the realized and unrealized nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil was 6508 equating to an estimated reference price of 59 which is within the phaseout range if prices remain at this level throughout 2006 we would experience a phaseout of the production tax credits and our synthetic fuel business would be adversely affected this could have an impact on our synthetic fuel production plans which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations cash flow and financial condition however we cannot predict with any certainty the reference price for 2006 or beyond 

there is legislation pending in congress that may impact the potential phaseout of production tax credits for 2006 and 2007 the legislation would use the prior year oil price to determine the current year reference price we are unable to predict the outcome of this legislation 

the gain from the sale of synfuel facilities is comprised of fixed and variable components the fixed component represents note payments of principal and interest is not subject to refund and is recognized as a gain when earned and collectibility is assured the variable component is based on an estimate of tax credits allocated to our partners is subject to refund based on the annual oil price phaseout and is recognized as a gain only when the probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is assured additionally based on estimates of tax credits allocated our partners reimburse us through the project entity for the operating losses of the synfuel facilities in the event that the tax credit is phased out we are contractually obligated to refund to our partners all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners to assess the probability of refund we use valuation and analysis models that calculate the probability of surpassing the estimated lower band of the phaseout range for the reference price of oil for the year due to the rise in oil prices there was a possibility that the 2005 reference price of oil could have reached the threshold at which production tax credits would have begun to phaseout we 

deferred all variable gains for the first three quarters of 2005 however in the fourth quarter of 2005 when there was persuasive evidence that the reference price of oil would not surpass the estimated lower band of the phaseout range we recognized all the variable gains related to 2005 of which 167 million pretax were attributable to the first three quarters of 2005 

due to changes in the agreements with certain of our synfuel partners and the exercise of existing rights by other of our synfuels partners a higher percentage of the expected payments in 2006 may be variable note payments as a result a larger portion of the 2006 synfuel payments may be subject to refund should a phaseout occur we will likely defer recognition of the quarterly variable and certain indemnified fixed note payments in 2006 until the probability of refund is remote and collectibility is assured 

as discussed in note 12 we have entered into derivative and other contracts to economically hedge a portion of our 2006 and 2007 synfuel cash flow exposure related to the risk of oil prices increasing the derivative contracts are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains we recorded a pretax mark to market gain of 48 million during 2005 as part of our synfuelrelated risk management strategy we continue to evaluate alternatives available to mitigate unhedged exposure to oil price volatility these contracts and other actions we can take and have taken will protect approximately 53 of our 2006 cash flow and 31 of our 2007 cash flow as our risk management position changes due to market volatility or legislative actions we may adjust our hedging strategy in response to changing conditions 

in addition to entering into economic hedges we can mitigate our exposure to a tax credit phaseout by shutting down or reducing production at our synfuel facilities which decreases the amount of operating losses we generate we regularly monitor oil prices and have created contingency plans to cease synfuel production 

assuming no synfuel tax credit phaseout we expect cash flow from our synfuel business will be approximately 12 billion from 2006 to 2008 if prices remain at current levels or increase throughout 2006 synfuel production levels may be reduced which would reduce the income and cash flow from this business if the reference price results in a complete phase out of the synfuel tax credits for 2006 and assuming the previously discussed current level of economic hedges and an early cessation of synfuel production to avoid operating losses there is a potential negative impact to net income and cash flow of 160 million and 140 million respectively before any potential asset impairment and goodwill writeoff 

unconventional gas production 

during the past year natural gas prices have reached historically high levels these high prices provide attractive opportunities for our unconventional gas production business segment we are an experienced operator with 15 years of experience in the antrim shale in northern michigan and we recently expanded our operations in the barnett shale basin in north central texas recent leasehold acquisitions have increased our total leasehold acreage to 452621 acres 366693 net of interest of others over the next few years our goal is to expand our existing leasehold acreage position and transform unproved acreage into proved reserves 

antrim shale – we plan to grow through the extension of existing producing areas and acquisition of other producer’s properties additionally we intend to develop existing acreage using the latest horizontal drilling techniques and to continue to search for expansion acreage some of our longterm fixedprice obligations for production of antrim gas begin to expire in 2006 this will create opportunities to remarket antrim production at significantly higher current market rates 

 

 

 barnett shale  we anticipate significant opportunities in our existing barnett shale acreage and expect continued extension of producing areas within the fort worth basin we are currently in the test and development phase for unproved and recently acquired barnett shale acreage we plan to increase our acreage through small negotiated acquisitions to build scale 

 

 

 due to high natural gas prices and the potential for successes within the barnett shale more capital is being invested into the region the competition for opportunities and goods and services may result in increased operating costs however our experience in the antrim shale and our experienced barnett shale personnel provide an advantage in addressing potential cost increases we expect to invest a combined amount of approximately 100 million to 130 million in our unconventional gas business in 2006 

fuel transportation and marketing 

pipelines processing and storage is in the process of expanding our storage capacity in michigan and expanding and building new pipeline capacity to the northeast united states our coal transportation 

and marketing business will seek to build our capacity to transport greater amounts of western coal and may seek to expand into coal terminals 

significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions most financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives as a result this segment may experience dramatic earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting periods we incur gains or losses in one period that are subsequently reversed when transactions are settled 

during 2005 our earnings were negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision in early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas the financial impact of this timing difference has begun to reverse as the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in storage in addition we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts some of these underlying contracts are not derivatives while the related economic hedges are derivatives and therefore marked to market as a result these transactions produce the timing related earnings swings from period to period we expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will not be fully realized until 2007 

operating system and performance excellence process 

we continuously review and adjust our cost structure and seek improvements in our processes beginning in 2002 we adopted the dte energy operating system which is the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems among other enhancements some of these cost reductions may be returned to our customers in the form of lower pscr charges and the remaining amounts may impact our profitability 

as an extension of this effort in mid2005 we initiated a companywide review of our operations called the performance excellence process the overarching goal has been and remains to become more competitive by reducing costs eliminating waste and optimizing business processes while improving customer service many of our customers are under intense economic pressure and will benefit from our efforts to keep down our costs and their rates additionally we will need significant resources in the future to invest in the infrastructure necessary to compete specifically we began a series of focused improvement initiatives within our electric and gas utilities and our corporate support function 

the process will be rigorous and challenging and seeks to yield sustainable performance to our customers and shareholders we have identified the performance excellence process as critical to our longterm growth strategy we are entering the implementation phase and expect to begin to realize the benefits from the effort in 2006 the cost to execute the performance excellence process could result in nonrecurring restructuring charges in 2006 

capital investment 

we anticipate significant capital investment across all of our business segments most of our capital expenditures will be concentrated within our utility segments our electric utility currently expects to invest approximately 4 billion due to increased environmental requirements and reliability enhancement projects through 2010 our gas utility currently expects to invest approximately 900 million on system expansion pipeline safety and reliability enhancement projects through the same period we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base 

during 2005 we began the first wave of implementation of dte2 an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems we anticipate 

spending 165 million to 190 million over the next two years as the remaining system elements are developed and business segments fully adopt dte2 

in the future we may build a new baseload electric generating plant the last base load plant constructed within our electric utility service territory was approximately twenty years ago a recently completed study sponsored by the mpsc projected that michigan may need to install 7000 mw of additional capacity over the next ten years we estimate that a new baseload plant will cost between 1 billion and 2 billion 

outlook 

the next few years will be a time of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry our strong utility base combined with our integrated nonutility operations position us well for longterm growth due to the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 and the repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 there are fewer barriers to mergers and acquisitions of utility companies we anticipate greater industry consolidation over the next few years resulting in the creation of large regional utility providers 

looking forward we will focus on several points that we expect will improve future performance 

 

along with pursuing a leaner organization we expect to receive an estimated 12 billion assuming no phaseout of synfuel cash flow through 2008 which consists of cash from operations asset sales and the utilization of production tax credits to reduce tax payments tax credit utilization in part could be extended past 2008 if taxable income is reduced from current forecasts however if oil prices remain at current levels or continue to increase the estimated cash flow from the synfuel business would as a result of production tax credit phaseout be significantly less and would adversely impact the success of this strategy unless we identify alternative sources of cash 

anticipated redeployment of this expected available cash will reduce dte energy’s debt and replace the value of synfuel operations inherent in our share price by pursuing investments in targeted energy markets if adequate investment opportunities are not available share repurchases may be used to build shareholder value we remain committed to a strong balance sheet and financial coverage ratios and paying an attractive dividend 

results of operations 

net income in 2005 was 537 million or 305 per diluted share compared to net income of 431 million or 249 per diluted share in 2004 and net income of 521 million or 309 per diluted share in 2003 the comparability of earnings was impacted by our discontinued businesses dte energy technologies dtech southern missouri gas company and itc and the adoption of a new accounting rule in 2005 and two new accounting rules in 2003 excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes our income from continuing operations in 2005 was 576 million or 327 per diluted share compared to income of 461 million or 266 per diluted share in 2004 and income of 494 million or 293 per diluted share in 2003 the following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments operating performance and future outlook 

 

 

the earnings per share of any segment does not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to any one segment but rather represents a direct or indirect equity interest in dte energy’s assets and liabilities as a whole 

electric utility 

our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison which is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 22 million customers in southeastern michigan 

factors impacting income our net income increased 127 million to 277 million in 2005 from 150 million in 2004 2004 net income decreased 102 million from 252 million in 2003 these results primarily reflect higher rates due to the november 2004 mpsc final rate order return of customers from the electric customer choice program warmer weather and lower operations and maintenance expenses in 2005 partially offset by a portion of higher fuel and purchased power costs which were unrecoverable as a result of residential rate caps which expired january 1 2006 and increased depreciation and amortization expenses 

 

gross margins increased 189 million during 2005 and declined 73 million in 2004 operating revenues increased due to higher demand resulting from warmer weather in 2005 and increased rates due to the november 2004 mpsc final rate order partially offset by unrecovered power supply costs as a result of residential rate caps which expired january 1 2006 and a poor michigan economy in 2005 gross margins were favorably impacted by decreased electric customer choice penetration whereby detroit edison lost 12 of retail sales to electric customer choice customers in 2005 and 18 of such sales during 2004 as retail customers migrated back to detroit edison as their electric generation provider rather than remaining with alternative suppliers the following table displays changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period 

 

 

 operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs increased in 2005 reflecting a 879 per mwh 58 increase in fuel and purchased power costs during the year fuel and purchased power costs are a passthrough with the reinstatement of the pscr mechanism except for residential customers whose rate caps expired in january 2006 

the increase in power supply costs was driven by higher seasonal demand higher purchased power rates higher coal prices and increased power purchases due to weather and plant outages pursuant to the mpsc final rate order transmission expense previously recorded in operation and maintenance expenses in 2004 is now reflected in purchased power expenses the pscr mechanism provides related revenues for the transmission expense 

the decline in 2004 revenues was partially offset by increased base rates resulting from the interim and final rate orders revenues in 2004 were adversely impacted by reduced cooling demand resulting from mild summer weather in addition operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs decreased in 2004 reflecting a 127 per mwh 8 decline in fuel and purchased power costs the loss of retail sales under the electric customer choice program also resulted in lower purchase power requirements as well as excess power capacity that was sold in the wholesale market under the 2004 interim and final rate orders revenues from selling excess power reduce the level of recoverable fuel and purchased power costs and therefore do not impact margins associated with uncapped customers 

the rate orders also lowered pscr revenues which were partially offset by increased base rate and transition charge revenues since fuel and purchased power costs are a passthrough with the reinstatement of the pscr in 2004 a decrease affects both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs but does not affect margins or earnings associated with uncapped customers the decrease in fuel and purchased power costs is attributable to lower priced purchases and the use of a more favorable power supply mix driven by higher generation output the favorable mix is due to lower purchases driven by lost sales under the electric customer choice program 

 

 

  

 

 operation and maintenance expense decreased 87 million in 2005 and increased 63 million in 2004 as a result of the mpsc final rate order transmission and miso expenses in 2005 are now included in purchased power expense with related revenues recorded through the pscr mechanism in addition as a result of the mpsc final rate order merger interest is no longer allocated from the dte energy parent company to detroit edison partially offsetting the lack of merger interest expense and the transmission expense accounting reclassification were higher 2005 storm expenses 

the 2004 increase reflects costs associated with maintaining our generation fleet including costs of scheduled and forced plant outages additionally the increase in 2004 is due to incremental costs associated with the implementation of our dte2 project 

operation and maintenance expense in both years includes higher employee pension and health care benefit costs due to financial market performance discount rates and health care cost trend rates and increased reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable reflecting high pastdue amounts attributable to economic conditions in addition we accrued a refund due from the midwest independent system operator in 2004 for transmission services 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 117 million in 2005 and increased 50 million in 2004 the increases reflect the income effect of recording regulatory assets which lowered depreciation and amortization expenses the regulatory asset deferrals totaled 46 million in 2005 107 million in 2004 and 153 million in 2003 representing net stranded costs and other costs we believe are recoverable under public act pa 141 additionally higher 2005 sales volumes compared to 2004 resulted in greater amortization of regulatory assets 

asset gains and losses net increased 25 million in 2005 as a result of our sale of land near our headquarters 

other income and deductions expense decreased 20 million in 2005 and increased 26 million in 2004 the 2005 decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense as a result of lower interest rates and a favorable adjustment related to tax audit settlements the 2004 increase is primarily due to lower income associated with recording a return on regulatory assets as well as costs associated with addressing the structural issues of pa 141 

outlook – we continue to improve the operating performance of detroit edison during the past year we have resolved many of our regulatory issues and continue to pursue additional regulatory solutions for structural problems within our competitive environment mainly electric customer choice and the need to adjust rates for each customer class to reflect the full cost of service 

concurrently we will move forward in our efforts to improve performance looking forward additional issues such as rising prices for coal uranium and health care continued underperformance of michigan’s economy and capital spending will result in us taking meaningful action to address our costs while continuing to provide quality customer service we will utilize the dte operating system and the performance excellence process to seek opportunities to improve productivity remove waste decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction 

long term we will be required to invest an estimated 24 billion on emission controls through 2018 should we be able to recover these costs in future rate cases we may experience a growth in earnings additionally our service territory may require additional generation capacity a new baseload generating plant has not been built within the state of michigan in the last 20 years should our regulatory environment be conducive to such a significant capital expenditure we may build or expand a new base load facility with an estimated cost of 1 billion to 2 billion 

the following variables either in combination or acting alone will impact our future results 

 

we expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk due to the electric customer choice program until the issues associated with this program are adequately addressed we will accrue as regulatory assets any future unrecovered generationrelated fixed costs stranded costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation and mpsc orders we cannot predict the outcome of these matters see note 4 

gas utility 

our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens fuel gas company citizens natural gas utilities subject to regulation by the mpsc michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 13 million residential commercial and industrial customers in the state of michigan michcon also has subsidiaries involved in the gathering and transmission of natural gas in northern michigan michcon operates one of the largest natural gas distribution and transmission systems in the united states citizens distributes natural gas in adrian michigan 

factors impacting income gas utility’s net income increased 17 million in 2005 and declined 9 million in 2004 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of the mpsc’s april 2005 gas cost recovery and final rate orders 

the mpsc final gas rate order disallowed recovery of 90 of the costs of a computer billing system that was in place prior to dte energy’s acquisition of mcn energy in 2001 michcon impaired this asset by approximately 42 million in the first quarter of 2005 this disallowance was not reflected at the dte energy level since this impairment was previously reserved at the time of the mcn acquisition in 2001 

 

gross margins increased 37 million in 2005 and increased 22 million in 2004 compared to the prior year gross margins in 2005 were favorably affected by higher base rates as a result of the interim and final gas rate orders and revenue associated with the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism authorized by the mpsc in april 2005 the mpsc issued an order in the 2002 gcr reconciliation case that disallowed 26 million representing unbilled revenues at december 2001 we recorded the impact of the disallowance during the first quarter of 2005 operating revenues and cost of gas increased in 2005 

reflecting higher gas prices which are recoverable from customers through the gcr mechanism the 2004 gross margin comparison was also affected by a 265 million pretax reserve recorded in 2003 for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to an mpsc order in michcon’s 2002 gcr plan case see note 4 

 

operation and maintenance expense increased 21 million in 2005 and 32 million in 2004 the 2005 increase is primarily due to the impact of the mpsc rate order that disallowed certain environmental expenses that had been recorded as a regulatory asset and its requirement to defer negative pension expense as a regulatory liability for 2005 uncollectible accounts receivables expense remained consistent with 2004 reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices continued weak economic conditions and inadequate governmentsponsored assistance for lowincome customers the 2005 final rate order provided revenue for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism to mitigate some of the effect of increasing uncollectible expense the increase in operation and maintenance expense was partially offset by the dte energy parent company no longer allocating mergerrelated interest to michcon effective in april 2005 as a result of the disallowance of those costs in the april 2005 final rate order the increase was also partially offset by a decline in accruals for injuries and damages during 2005 

the 2004 period reflects higher reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and pension and health care costs the increase in uncollectible accounts expense reflects high past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices continued weak economic conditions and a lack of adequate public assistance for lowincome customers 

asset gains and losses net declined 7 million in 2005 as a result of a writeoff of certain computer equipment and related depreciation resulting from the april 2005 final rate order 

income taxes increased by 7 million in 2005 and decreased by 9 million in 2004 due to variations in pretax earnings 

outlook – operating results are expected to vary as a result of factors such as regulatory proceedings weather changes in economic conditions cost containment efforts and process improvements higher gas prices and economic conditions have resulted in continued pressure on receivables and working capital requirements partially mitigated by the gcr mechanism we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates in the april 2005 final gas rate order the mpsc adopted michcon’s proposed tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable each year michcon will file an application comparing its actual uncollectible expense for the prior calendar year to its designated revenue recovery of approximately 37 million ninety percent of the difference will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 

nonutility operations 

power and industrial projects 

power and industrial projects is comprised of coalbased fuels onsite energy projects nonutility power generation landfill gas recovery and waste coal recovery coalbased fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from two coke battery plants the production of synthetic fuel from all of our synfuel plants and the production of coke from one of our coke batteries generate production tax credits onsite energy projects include pulverized coal injection power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply nonutility power generation owns and operates four gasfired peaking electric generating plants and manages and operates one additional gasfired power plant under contract landfill gas recovery develops owns and operates landfill recovery systems throughout the united states waste coal recovery uses proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries typically discarded from coal mining operations 

factors impacting income  net income increased 129 million in 2005 and decreased 18 million in 2004 compared to 2003 these results primarily reflect higher gains recognized from selling interests in our synfuel plants gains and losses on synfuel hedges and varying levels of production tax credits 

 

operating revenues increased 256 million in 2005 and 162 million in 2004 primarily reflecting higher synfuel sales due to increased production and higher market prices for our coke production operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses which have been more than offset by the resulting production tax credits when we sell an interest in a synfuel project we recognize the gain from such sale as the facility produces and sells synfuel and 

when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

the improvement in 2004 synfuel revenues results from increased production due to additional sales of project interests in 2004 reflecting our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests in order to optimize income and cash flow 

revenues from onsite energy projects increased in 2005 reflecting the addition of new facilities completion of new longterm utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large manufacturer of paper products revenues in 2004 include a 9 million pretax fee generated in conjunction with the development of a related energy project 50 of which was sold to an unaffiliated partner 

operation and maintenance expense increased 281 million in 2005 and 108 million in 2004 reflecting costs associated with increased synfuel production 2005 acquisitions of three onsite energy projects and coke operations partially offsetting 2004 higher synfuel operating costs was the recording of insurance proceeds associated with an accident at one of our coke batteries 

asset gains and losses net increased 153 million in 2005 and 101 million in 2004 the improvements are due to increased production and sales volume from our synfuel projects to economically hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce synfuel sales proceeds we entered into derivative and other contracts the derivative contracts are marked to market with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains we recorded 2005 synfuel hedge mark to market gains of 48 million compared to 2004 mark to market losses of 12 million see note 12 

minority interest increased 69 million in 2005 and 121 million in 2004 reflecting our partners’ share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during prior periods resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our partners 

income taxes increased 47 million in 2005 and 313 million in 2004 the increase in 2005 reflects higher taxable earnings partially offset by higher production tax credits the increase in 2004 reflects higher taxable earnings and a decline in the level of production tax credits due to the sale of interests in synfuel facilities 

outlook  we may sell additional interests in our synfuel plants and take actions to protect our expected synfuel cash flows from the risk of an oil pricerelated phaseout synfuelrelated tax credits expire on december 31 2007 

in the third quarter of 2005 we executed an agreement to purchase five onsite energy projects and closed on three of the projects in 2005 

power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy business we expect solid earnings from our onsite energy business in 2006 

production tax credits generated by our coalbased fuels and landfill gas recovery businesses are subject to the same phase out risk if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels see note 13 

unconventional gas production 

unconventional gas production is primarily engaged in natural gas exploration development and production our unconventional gas production business produces gas from the antrim and barnett shales and sells most of the gas to the fuel transportation and marketing segment 

factors impacting income  net income decreased 2 million in 2005 and decreased 6 million in 2004 the decline in 2005 is due to higher operating and michigan severance tax expenses the decline in 2004 is due to increased interest costs and a gain that was recognized in 2003 as a result of a sale of a noncore asset 

 

operating revenues increased 3 million in 2005 and increased 1 million in 2004 due primarily to higher gas prices 

operations and maintenance expenses increased 3 million in 2005 and increased 5 million in 2004 increases are associated with the addition of approximately 300 producing wells during the three year period the 2004 increase is also due to a 6 million pretax gain on the sale of noncore assets recorded in 2003 

taxes other than income increased 4 million in 2005 due to higher severance taxes associated with gas price increases 

other income and deductions decreased 2 million in 2005 and increased 3 million in 2004 interest expense was the primary contributor to the variances 

outlook – we expect to continue to develop our proved areas test unproved areas and prudently add new acreage in michigan and texas during 2005 we increased our acreage holdings by 38437 acres 24852 net of the interest of others in the antrim and barnett shales results from the barnett shale test wells drilled during 2005 are expected during the first half of 2006 we expect to invest a combined amount of approximately 100 million to 130 million in our unconventional gas business in 2006 

fuel transportation and marketing 

fuel transportation and marketing consists of dte energy trading coal transportation and marketing and the pipelines processing and storage business 

dte energy trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing structured transactions enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants and the optimization of contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions our customer base is predominantly utilities local distribution companies large industrials and other marketing and trading companies we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the marktomarket method which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives we utilize forwards futures swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines dte energy trading is integral in providing commodity risk management services to the other unregulated businesses within dte energy 

coal transportation and marketing provides fuel transportation and rail equipment management services we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers additionally we participate in coal trading and coaltopower tolling transactions as well as the purchase and sale of emissions credits we recently initiated a new business line coal mine methane extraction in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines industrial users or for small power generation projects 

pipelines processing and storage has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field as well as lease rights to another natural gas storage field the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations 

factors impacting income  net income decreased 116 million in 2005 consisting primarily of a 131 million decline at dte energy trading associated with marktomarket losses on gas storage hedges net income increased 49 million in 2004 consisting primarily of a 47 million improvement at dte energy trading the comparability of results is impacted by a 74 million onetime pretax gain from a contract modificationtermination recorded in the first quarter of 2004 and significant 2005 marktomarket losses on derivative contracts used to economically hedge our gas in storage and forward power contracts 

 

operating revenues increased 430 million in 2005 and increased 193 million in 2004 both coal transportation and marketing and dte energy trading experienced revenue growth in 2005 due to higher demand higher commodity pricing the sale of emission credits and increased trading volume comparability of 2005 to 2004 is affected because our trading operations recorded an adjustment in 2004 that increased revenue by 86 million related to the modification of a future purchase commitment under a transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company see note 13 

coal transportation and marketing revenues in 2004 were affected by our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests this strategy resulted in the reduction of synfuel 

production levels we were contractually obligated to supply coal to customers at certain sites that did not produce synfuel as a result of our production strategy to meet our obligations to provide coal under longterm contracts with customers we acquired coal that was resold to customers the coal was sold at prices higher than the prices at which synfuel would have been sold to these customers 

fuel purchased power and gas increased 497 million in 2005 and decreased 170 million in 2004 during 2005 our earnings have been negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision in early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in storage in addition we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts we expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will be fully realized by the end of 2007 

in 2004 our trading operations recorded a gas inventory adjustment that increased expense by 12 million related to the termination of a longterm gas exchange agreement with an interstate pipeline company see note 13 under the gas exchange agreement we received gas from the customer during the summer injection period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season 

operation and maintenance expenses increased 114 million in 2005 and increased 262 million in 2004  during 2005 our coal transportation and marketing business experienced higher throughput volumes and increased prices for coal the increase in 2004 was due primarily to increased coal purchases and increased lease expense 

other income and deductions for 2005 remained consistent with 2004 and decreased 25 million in 2004 the decline in 2004 is primarily due to gains recorded in 2003 from selling our 16 pipeline interest in the portland natural gas transmission system 

income tax provision decreased 65 million in 2005 and increased 23 million in 2004 due to variations in earnings 

outlook – we expect to continue to grow our coal services and dte energy trading businesses in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and customtailored bundled services to largevolume end users and utilities this capacity coupled with the synergies from dte energy’s other businesses positions the segment to add value and mitigate risks 

we expect to continue to grow our pipeline processing and storage business by expanding existing assets and developing new assets pipelines processing and storage received mpsc approval in september 2005 and executed longterm contracts for a capacity expansion at one of our michigan storage fields that will facilitate an additional 14 bcf of storage service sales starting in april 2006 vector pipeline has secured longterm market commitments to support an expansion project for approximately 200 mmcf per day with a projected inservice date of november 2007 vector pipeline expects to receive ferc approval in the second quarter of 2006 the millennium pipeline filed an application for ferc approval in august 2005 in addition pipeline processing and storage owns a 105 interest in the millennium pipeline and is currently negotiating to increase its equity interest 

significant portions of the fuel transportation and marketing portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as capacity positions of natural gas storage and pipelines and power transmission contracts the financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives as a result we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the majority of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle which does not coincide with the calendar and fiscal year but runs annually from april of one year to march of the next year our strategy is to economically hedge the price risk of storage with overthecounter forwards and futures current accounting rules require the marking to market of forward 

sales and futures but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods we generally anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse by the end of each storage cycle see “fair value of contracts” section that follows 

corporate  other 

corporate  other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting legal and information technology services as these functions essentially support the entire company their costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized therefore the effect of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year additionally corporate  other holds certain nonutility debt assets held for sale and energy related investments 

factors impacting income  corporate  other results declined 40 million in 2005 compared to a 53 million improvement in 2004 the 2005 decline was primarily a result of the parent company not allocating merger interest to detroit edison and michcon partially offsetting 2005 increased expenses were reduced michigan single business taxes and gains on the sale of nonstrategic assets the 2004 improvement was affected by a 14 million net of tax gain from the sale of 35 million shares of plug power stock as well as lower michigan single business taxes resulting from tax saving initiatives corporate  other also benefited from lower financing costs 

discontinued operations 

dte energy technologies dtech  we own dtech which assembles markets distributes and services distributed generation products provides application engineering and monitors and manages onsite generation system operations in july 2005 management approved the restructuring of this business resulting in the identification of certain assets and liabilities to be sold or abandoned primarily associated with standby and continuous duty operations we recognized a net of tax restructuring loss of 23 million during the third quarter of 2005 primarily representing the write down to fair value of the assets of dtech less costs to sell and the writeoff of goodwill as we execute the restructuring plan there may be adjustments to amounts recorded related to the impairment and exit costs we anticipate completing the restructuring plan by mid2006 

southern missouri gas company  we owned southern missouri gas company smgc a public utility engaged in the distribution transmission and sale of natural gas in southern missouri in the first quarter of 2004 management approved the marketing of smgc for sale as of march 31 2004 smgc met the criteria of an asset “held for sale” and we have reported its operating results as a discontinued operation we recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately 7 million representing the writedown to fair value of the assets of smgc less costs to sell and the writeoff of allocated goodwill in november 2004 we entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of smgc regulatory approval was received in april 2005 and the sale closed in may 2005 during the second quarter of 2005 we recognized a net of tax gain of 2 million 

international transmission company  in february 2003 we sold international transmission company itc our electric transmission business to affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co and trimaran capital partners llc through december 31 2004 we recorded a gain of 58 million net of tax during the second quarter of 2005 the gain was adjusted to 56 million net of tax 

see note 3 

cumulative effect of accounting changes 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we adopted additional new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2005 earnings by 3 million 

on january 1 2003 we adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy trading activities the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2003 earnings by 27 million 

see note 2 

capital resources and liquidity 

dte energy and its subsidiaries require cash to operate and is provided by both internally and externally generated sources we manage our liquidity and capital resources to maintain financial flexibility to meet our current and future cash flow needs 

cash requirements 

we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses retire and pay interest on longterm debt and pay dividends our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2006 of up to 12 billion the capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures we may spend an additional 200 million to 400 million on growthrelated projects within our nonregulated businesses in 2006 

capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2006 primarily as a result of dte2 and environmental spending during 2005 we began the first wave of implementation of dte2 an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems we anticipate spending 165 million to 190 million over the next two years as the remaining system elements are developed and business segments fully adopt dte2 

we anticipate environmental capital expenditures of approximately 250 million in 2006 and up to approximately 23 billion of future capital expenditures to satisfy both existing and proposed new requirements 

we expect nonutility capital spending will approximate 200 million to 400 million annually for the next several years capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria 

debt maturing in 2006 totals approximately 682 million 

we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital requirements 

 

cash from operating activities 

a majority of the company’s operating cash flow is provided by our two utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs 

our nonutility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range of operating profiles the profiles vary from our synthetic fuels business which we believe will provide approximately 12 billion of cash during 20062008 assuming no phaseout to new startups these new startups include our unconventional gas and waste coal recovery businesses which we are growing and if successful could require significant investment 

cash from operations totaling 1001 billion in 2005 was up 6 million from the comparable 2004 period the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over 83 million in net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains substantially offset by a 77 million increase in working capital and other requirements most of the improvement was driven by higher net income at detroit edison which was the result of improved revenues and gross margin stemming from higher rates granted in the 2004 rate orders warmer weather and lower customer choice penetration the offsetting increase in working capital requirements was driven by a 127 million pscr underrecovery in 2005 as compared to a 112 million overrecovery in 2004 working capital requirements also reflect the higher cost of gas at michcon and our fuel transportation and marketing segment michcon’s working capital and other requirements were 136 million higher in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher gas costs this impact was reflected by accounts receivable balances that were 198 million higher at december 31 2005 than the previous year at michcon the increase in working capital requirements was mitigated by lower income tax payments in 2005 and 

company initiatives to improve cash flow including better inventory management cash sales transactions and the utilization of letters of credit 

our net operating cash flow in 2004 was 995 million reflecting a 45 million increase from 2003 the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over 300 million in net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains substantially offset by a 259 million increase in working capital and other requirements a portion of this improvement is attributable to the change in our strategy to primarily produce synfuel from plants in which we have sold interests as previously discussed synfuel projects generate operating losses which have been more than offset by tax credits that we have been unable to fully utilize thereby negatively affecting operating cash flow cash for working capital primarily reflects higher income tax payments of 172 million in 2004 reflecting a different payment pattern of taxes in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase in working capital was mitigated by company initiatives to improve cash flow including better inventory management cash sales transactions deferral of retirement plan contributions and the utilization of letters of credit certain cash initiatives in 2003 lowered cash flow in 2004 

outlook – we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily due to improvements from utility rate increases and the sales of interests in our synfuel projects partially offset by higher cash requirements on environmental and other utility capital as well as growth investments in our nonutility portfolio we are likely to incur costs associated with implementation of our performance excellence process but we expect to realize long term cost savings we also may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our pscr and gcr costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of recent mpsc orders gas prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital improvement initiatives 

operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in 2006 due to the structure of the interim and final rate orders we will begin to realize the full benefits of interim and final rate relief in 2006 when all customer rate caps expire improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better management of our working capital requirements including the continued focus on reducing past due accounts receivable our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be cash generation and conservation 

assuming no production tax credit phaseout cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to be approximately 400 million 500 million and 300 million in 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively including 300 million tax credit carryforward utilization by dte energy the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet we expect to use this cash to reduce debt to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria and to potentially repurchase common stock if adequate investment opportunities are not available our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios to improve our current credit rating and outlook and to replace the value of synfuel operations currently inherent in our share price however if oil prices remain at current levels or increase throughout 2006 the expected cash flow from the synfuel business would be less and could adversely impact the success of this strategy unless the company identifies alternative sources of cash synfuel cash flow consists of variable and fixed payments from partners proceeds from option and other contracts used to protect us from risk of loss from a tax credit phaseout and the use of prior years’ tax credit carryforwards since 2004 we have spent approximately 105 million hedging our future synfuel cash flow and may spend up to 50 million in 2006 

our other operating nonutility businesses are expected to contribute approximately 500 million through 2008 remaining startup businesses such as unconventional gas production waste coal recovery and distributed generation will continue to use cash in excess of their cash generation over the next couple of years while they are being further developed certain of the previously discussed cash initiatives resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in 2005 which will have the impact of lowering cash flow in 2006 

cash from investing activities 

cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets in any given year we will look to realize cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements capital spending within our nonutility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we invest tentatively based on research and analysis we start with a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 

net cash outflows relating to investing activities increased 121 million in 2005 and 691 million in 2004 compared to the prior year the 2005 change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures partially offset by higher synfuel proceeds spending on growth project investments increased 123 million in 2005 while spending on environmental projects was 44 million higher than the 2004 period the 2004 change was primarily due to proceeds received in 2003 totaling 758 million from the sale of itc interests in three synfuel projects and nonstrategic assets additionally the change was due to variations in cash contractually designated for debt service 

longer term with the expected improvement at our utilities and assuming continued cash generation from the synfuel business cash flows are expected to improve we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria 

cash from financing activities 

we rely on both shortterm borrowing and longterm financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by the company’s operations shortterm borrowings which are mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 or lower to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our longterm debt and strengthening our balance sheet the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs 

net cash used for financing activities improved 145 million in 2005 and improved 727 million in 2004 compared to the prior periods the improvement in 2005 was primarily driven by the issuance of common stock which resulted from the conversion of our equity security units the change in 2004 was primarily due to higher issuances of longterm debt and levels of shortterm debt borrowings which exceeded the requirements of longterm debt redemptions 

see note 9 – longterm debt and preferred securities and note 10 – shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings for more information regarding financing activities 

amounts available under shelf registrations include 500 million at dte energy 250 million at detroit edison and 200 million at michcon in 2006 we plan on filing new shelf registration statements for dte energy and detroit edison 

common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash in january 2005 we announced that the dte energy board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 700 million in common stock through 2008 the authorization provides company management with flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time and will depend on future cash flows and investment opportunities no share repurchases were made in 2005 as of january 1 2005 we discontinued issuing new dte energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan which generated approximately 50 million annually we also contributed 170 million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of 2004 in august 2005 we issued 37 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the settlement of the stock purchase component of our equity security units 

contractual obligations 

the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2005 

 

 

 credit ratings 

credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities management believes that the current credit ratings of the company provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to the company may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 

we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various nonutility subsidiaries in the event that our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately 536 million at december 31 2005 additionally upon a downgrade our trading business could be required to restrict operations and our access to the shortterm commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating agencies all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities 

 

critical accounting estimates 

there are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment such estimates relate to regulation risk management and trading activities production tax credits goodwill pension and postretirement costs the allowance for doubtful accounts and legal and tax reserves 

regulation 

a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of our businesses if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no 71 on all our operations we estimate that the extraordinary loss would be as follows 

 

 

 management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment see note 4 

risk management and trading activities 

all derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as “assets or 1iabilities from risk management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended through december 2002 trading activities were accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9810 accounting for energy trading and risk management activities  effective january 2003 trading activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 see note 2 

the offsetting entry to “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge accounting the fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each reporting period for changes using market sources such as 

 

market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective transparent prices can be obtained unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this criterion 

production tax credits 

we generate production tax credits from our synfuel coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations we recognize earnings as tax credits are generated at our facilities in one of two ways first to the extent we have sold an interest in our synfuel facilities to third parties we recognize gains as synfuel is produced and sold and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured second to the extent we generate credits to our own account we recognize earnings through reduced tax expense 

all production tax credits are subject to audit by the irs however all of our synfuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations audits of five of our synfuel facilities were successfully completed in the past two years if production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit there could be a significant writeoff of previously recorded earnings from such tax credits 

tax credits generated by our facilities were 617 million in 2005 as compared to 449 million in 2004 and 387 million in 2003 the portion of tax credits generated for our own account was 55 million in 2005 as compared to 38 million in 2004 and 241 million in 2003 with the remaining credits generated allocated to third party partners 

goodwill 

certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in order to perform these impairment tests we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation techniques which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 

as of december 31 2005 our goodwill totaled 21 billion the majority of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units with 772 million allocated to the gas utility reporting unit the value of the utility reporting units may be significantly impacted by rate orders and the regulatory environment the gas utility reporting unit is comprised primarily of michcon we have made certain assumptions for michcon that incorporate earnings multiples used in the cash flow valuations these assumptions may change as regulatory and market conditions change 

we also have 41 million of goodwill allocated to the power and industrial projects reporting unit the value of the power and industrial projects reporting unit may be significantly impacted by any phaseout of tax credits related to our synfuel business we have assumed there will be no phaseout of synfuel tax credits and will monitor the status of any potential phaseout and its impact on our valuation assumptions 

during 2005 we recorded an impairment of 16 million to goodwill related to discontinuing the operations of dtech 

based on our 2005 goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of our remaining operating reporting units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed we will continue to monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections 

pension and postretirement costs 

our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors including rates of return on plan assets the discount rate the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions 

we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of 90 million in 2005 81 million in 2004 and 47 million in 2003 postretirement benefits costs for all plans were 155 million in 2005 125 million in 2004 and 118 million in 2003 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2005 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 90 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated input from our consultants including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity and bond markets our 2006 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 66 in equity markets 25 in fixed income markets and 9 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe that 875 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets for 2006 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 

we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a threeyear period accordingly the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded we have unrecognized net losses due to the performance of the financial markets as of december 31 2005 we had 6 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the yield curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans the discount rate determined on this basis decreased from 60 at december 31 2004 to 59 at december 31 2005 due to recent financial market performance lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates we estimate that our 2006 pension costs will approximate 80 million compared to 96 million in 2005 and our 2006 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 192 million compared to 155 million in 2005 in the last several years we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design additionally future pension costs for detroit edison will be affected by a pension tracking mechanism which was authorized by the mpsc in its november 2004 rate order the tracking mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in detroit edison’s base rates in april 2005 the mpsc approved the deferral of the noncapitalized portion of michcon’s negative pension expense michcon will record a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2005 qualified pension costs by approximately 24 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by onepercentagepoint would have increased our 2005 pension costs by approximately 10 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by onepercentagepoint 

would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2005 by approximately 20 million 

the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the financial markets the value of our plan assets increased from 29 billion at december 31 2003 to 33 billion at december 31 2004 the value at december 31 2005 was 33 billion the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional minimum pension liability an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders’ equity in 2003 2004 and 2005 the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow 

pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without substantial returns in the financial markets we made a 222 million cash contribution in 2003 and a 170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in 2004 we did not make pension contributions in 2005 we contributed 80 million to our postretirement plans in 2004 we did not contribute to our postretirement plans in 2003 and 2005 we do not anticipate making a contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2006 at the discretion of management we may make up to a 120 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2006 

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act was signed into law this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law the effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced costs by 20 million in 2005 and 16 million in 2004 

see note 14 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers historical trends economic conditions age of receivables and other information higher customer bills due to increased gas prices the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2004 and 2005 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates as part of the 2005 rate order for michcon the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible accounts tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in light of rising energy prices would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 

legal and tax reserves 

we are involved in various legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the company tax reserves are based upon management’s assessment of potential adjustments to tax positions taken we regularly review ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience in addition to current tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments 

environmental matters 

protecting the environment as well as correcting past environmental damage continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators legislation andor rulemaking could further impact the electric utility 

industry including detroit edison the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to cleanup contaminated property 

electric utility 

air  detroit edison is subject to epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in march 2005 epa issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone fine particulate regional haze and mercury air pollution the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions to comply with these requirements detroit edison has spent approximately 644 million through 2005 we estimate detroit edison will incur future capital expenditures of up to 218 million in 2006 and up to 22 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements under the june 2000 michigan restructuring legislation beginning january 1 2004 annual return of and on this capital expenditure was deferred in ratemaking until december 31 2005 the expiration of the rate cap period 

the epa has ongoing enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison in october 2003 the epa promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review provisions going forward several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and in december 2003 a stay was issued until the us court of appeals dc circuit renders an opinion in the case we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison 

water  detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities based on the results of the studies to be conducted over the next several years detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes it is estimated that we will incur up to 50 million over the next four to six years in additional capital expenditures to comply with these requirements 

contaminated sites  detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including two former mgp sites the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations we have a reserve balance of 13 million as of december 31 2005 for the remediation of these sites over the next several years 

gas utility 

contaminated sites  prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal coke or oil gas utility owns or previously owned 15 former mgp sites investigations have revealed contamination related to the byproducts of gas manufacturing at each site in addition to the mpg sites gas utility is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years as a result of these determinations we have recorded liabilities of 35 million and 1 million for the mgps and other contaminated sites respectively it is estimated that gas utility may incur 5 million in expenses related to cleanup costs in 2006 while we cannot make any assurances we believe that a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for the mgp sites approved by the mpsc will prevent these costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in 1993 a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism was approved by the mpsc for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former mgp sites in excess of this reserve gas utility employed outside consultants to evaluate remediation alternatives for these sites to assist in estimating its potential liabilities and to review its archived insurance policies as a result of these studies gas utility accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of 35 million during 1995 during 2005 we spent approximately 4 million investigating and remediating these former mgp sites in december 2005 we retained multiple environmental consultants to estimate the projected cost to remediate each 

mgp site we accrued an additional 9 million in remediation liabilities associated with two of our mgp sites to increase the reserve balance to 35 million at december 31 2005 

any significant change in assumptions such as remediation techniques nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and thereby affect the company’s financial position and cash flows however we anticipate the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the mpsc will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

other 

our nonutility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we are in the process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facilities in michigan we expect the projects to be completed within two years at a cost of approximately 25 million our other nonutility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 

various state and federal laws regulate our handling storage and disposal of waste materials the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property we have extensive land holdings and from time to time must investigate claims of improperly disposed contaminants we anticipate our utility and nonutility companies may periodically be included in various types of environmental proceedings 

dte2 

in 2003 we began the development of dte2 an enterprise resource planning erp system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems relating to finance human resources supply chain and work management as part of this initiative we are implementing enterprise business systems software including among others products developed by sap ag and mro software inc the first phase of implementation occurred in 2005 in the regulated electric fossil generation unit full implementation throughout the company is not anticipated until 2007 the conversion of data and the implementation and operation of the erp will be continuously monitored and reviewed and should ultimately strengthen our internal control structure and lead to increased cost efficiencies although our implementation plan includes detailed testing and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and successful transition we can provide no assurance that complications will not arise that could interrupt our operations 

we have spent approximately 210 million through the end of 2005 and expect total spending over the life of the project to be between 375 million and 400 million we expect the benefits of lower costs faster business cycles repeatable and optimized processes enhanced internal controls improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs to outweigh the expense of our investment in this initiative 

midwest independent system operator miso 

the miso was formed in 1996 by its member transmission owners and in december 2001 received ferc approval as a regional transmission organization rto authorized to provide regional transmission services as prescribed by ferc in its order 2000 order 2000 requires an rto to perform eight functions including tariff administration transmission system congestion management provision of ancillary services to support transmission operations market monitoring interregional coordination and the coordination of system planning and expansion miso’s independence from ownership of either generation or transmission facilities is intended to enable it to ensure fair access to the transmission grid and through its congestion management role miso is also charged with ensuring grid reliability miso’s initial provision of transmission services in december 2001 was known as day 1 operations 

in keeping with order 2000 which permits rtos to provide realtime energy imbalance services and a marketbased mechanism for congestion management miso on april 1 2005 launched its midwest energy market or day 2 operations and began regional wholesale electric market operations and transmission service throughout its area a key feature of the midwest energy market is the establishment of locational marginal prices lmps which provide price transparency for the sale and purchase of wholesale electricity at different locations in the market territory the lmp is the market clearing price at a specific pricing location in the midwest energy market that is equal to the cost of supplying the next increment of load at that location the value of an lmp is the same whether a purchase or sale is made at that location detroit edison participates in the midwest energy market by offering its generation on a dayahead and real time basis and by bidding for power in the market to serve its load the cost of power procured from the market net of any gain realized from generation sold into the market is included and recovered through the pscr mechanism in addition lmps are expected to encourage new generation to locate where the power produced is of most value to the load and is expected to identify where new transmission facilities are needed to relieve grid congestion 

miso is compensated for assuring grid reliability and for supporting the energy market through fercapproved rates charged to load detroit edison became a nontransmission owning member of miso in compliance with section 10w 1 of pa 141 the mpsc has ordered that miso costs charged to detroit edison should be recovered through the pscr mechanism 

federal energy policy act of 2005 

in august 2005 the energy policy act of 2005 energy act was signed into law among other provisions the energy act 

 

the implementation of the energy act requires proceedings at the state level and development of regulations by the ferc as well as other federal agencies the impact of the energy act on our results of operations will depend on the implementation of final rules and cannot be fully determined at this time 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2— new accounting pronouncements for discussion of new pronouncements  

fair value of contracts 

the following disclosures are voluntary and provide enhanced transparency of the derivative activities and position of our trading businesses and our other businesses 

we use the criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted to determine if certain contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments the rules for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex moreover significant judgment is required to determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently if a contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument it is recorded in the financial statements as “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” at the fair value of the contract the recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted quarterly to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract a practice known as mark to market mtm accounting 

fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an armslength transaction to determine the fair value of contracts accounted for as derivative instruments we use a combination of quoted market prices and mathematical valuation models valuation models require various inputs including forward prices volatility interest rates and exercise periods 

contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments are power gas and oil forwards futures options and swaps as well as foreign currency contracts items we do not generally account for as derivatives and which are therefore excluded from the following tables include gas inventory gas storage and transportation arrangements fullrequirements power contracts and gas and oil reserves as subsequently discussed we have fully reserved the value of derivative contracts beyond the liquid trading timeframe thereby not impacting income 

the subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating characteristics and key risks 

 

 

rollforward of mark to market energy contract net assets 

the following tables provide details on changes in our mark to market net asset or liability position during 2005 

 

the following table provides a current and noncurrent analysis of “assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities” as reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position as of december 31 2005 amounts that relate to contracts that become due within twelve months are classified as current and all remaining amounts are classified as noncurrent 

 

maturity of fair value of mtm energy contract net assets 

we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe our intent is to recognize mtm activity only when pricing data is obtained from active quotes and published indexes actively quoted and published indexes include exchange traded ie nymex and overthecounter positions for which broker quotes are available although the nymex has currently quoted prices for the next 72 months broker quotes for gas and power are generally available for 18 and 24 months into the future respectively we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact income 

as a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles the tables above do not include the expected favorable earnings impacts of certain nonderivative gas storage and power contracts we entered into economically favorable transactions in early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost 

of gas in storage in addition we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts we expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will be fully realized by the end of 2007 

the table below shows the maturity of our mtm positions 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

dte energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal uranium and electricity to meet its obligations during periods of peak demand we also are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts gas production and gas inventories to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations we have entered into a series of electricity and gas futures forwards option and swap contracts commodity price risk associated with our electric and gas utilities is limited due to the pscr and gcr mechanisms see note 1 

our coalbased fuels and landfill gas recovery businesses are also subject to crude oil price risk as previously discussed production tax credits generated by dte energy’s synfuel coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations are subject to phaseout if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels we have entered into a series of derivative contracts for 2006 through 2007 to economically hedge the impact of oil prices on a portion of our synfuel cash flow 

see note 12 

credit risk 

bankruptcies 

we purchase and sell electricity gas coal coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel automotive energy retail and other industries certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the u s bankruptcy code we regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss we believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss the final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

other 

we engage in business with customers that are noninvestment grade we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and when deemed necessary we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations 

we utilize both external and internally generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties the following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of december 31 2005 

 

 

 interest rate risk 

dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities in order to manage interest costs we use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates commercial paper rates and london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2005 the company has a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately 15 excluding securitized debt 

foreign currency risk 

dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for longterm transportation capacity to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations we have entered into a series of currency forward contracts through 2008 additionally we may enter into fair value currency hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans 

summary of sensitivity analysis 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the fair values of our commodity contracts longterm debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december 31 2005 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values the results of the sensitivity analysis calculations follow

 items 1  2 business and properties general in 1995 dte energy incorporated in the state of michigan our utility operations consist primarily of detroit edison and michcon we also have numerous nonutility subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing and trading energy services and various other electricity coal and gas related businesses dte energy is an exempt holding company under the public utility holding company act puhca of 1935 except section 9a2 that relates to the acquisition of securities of public utility companies and section 33 that relates to the acquisition of foreign nonus utility companies detroit edison is a michigan corporation organized in 1903 and is a public utility subject to regulation by the michigan public service commission mpsc and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc detroit edison is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electricity to 21 million customers in southeastern michigan michcon is a michigan corporation organized in 1898 and is a public utility subject to regulation by the mpsc michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to 12 million customers throughout michigan in february 2003 we sold the international transmission company itc a ferc regulated transmission company see note 3 for a further discussion of the itc sale and its presentation as a discontinued operation our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to such reports are available free of charge through the investor relations page of our website wwwdteenergycom  as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec the information on our website is not and shall not be deemed to be a part of this form 10k or any other filing we make with the sec our previously filed reports and statements are also available at the sec’s website wwwsecgov  we have a code of ethics that applies to our chief executive officer and all senior financial officers including our chief financial officer controller assistant controllers treasurer and assistant treasurers our code of ethics is available in the corporate governance section of the investor relations webpage of our website located at wwwdteenergycom  should we make changes in or provide waivers from the provisions of the code of ethics that the sec requires us to disclose we intend to disclose these events in the governance section of our investor relations website references in this report to “we” “us” “our” or “company” are to dte energy and its subsidiaries collectively corporate structure through 2004 we operated our businesses through three strategic business units energy resources energy distribution and energy gas each business unit had utility and nonutility operations the balance of our business consisted of corporate  other see note 16 — segment and related information for financial information by segment for the last three years in 2005 we expect to realign our business 5 

units to strengthen the company’s focus on customer relationships and growth within our nonutility businesses based on this structure we will set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance beginning with the first quarter of 2005 we expect to report our segment information based on a new structure as described in note 1 a discussion of each business unit based on the structure in effect over the past three years follows energy resources utility – power generation description power generation comprises our utility power generation business and plants within detroit edison these plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including the mpsc the ferc the nrc the epa and the mdeq electricity is generated from detroit edison’s numerous fossil plants its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant and is purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to four major classes of customers residential commercial industrial and wholesale principally throughout michigan the midwest and ontario canada weather economic factors and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands power generation sales are made to a diverse base of customers in both type and number sales levels are not dependent on any small market segment customers who elect to purchase their electricity from alternative energy suppliers by participating in the electric customer choice program have an unfavorable effect on our financial performance 6 

our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with market purchases the following table details our energy supply mix and average cost per unit  

 

1 represents fuel costs associated with power plants 

2 includes amounts associated with hedging activities we expect an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers the effect of lost sales due to the electric customer choice program has reduced our need for purchased power and increased our ability to sell power in the wholesale market we have short and longterm supply contracts for expected fuel and purchased power requirements as detailed in the following table  

 

power generation’s generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms detroit edison expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases detroit edison has contracts with five coal suppliers and several overthecounter brokers for a total purchase of up to 35 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered through 2008 detroit edison also has contracts with four suppliers for the purchase of approximately 6 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered through 2006 these existing longterm coal contracts either have fixed prices or include provisions for price escalation as well as deescalation given the geographic diversity of supply detroit edison believes it can meet the expected generation requirements we own and lease a fleet of rail cars and have longterm transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities we purchase power from other electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers these purchases supplement our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles for example when high temperatures occur during the summer we require additional electricity to meet demand this access to additional power is an efficient and economical way to meet our obligation to customers without increasing capital expenditures to build additional power facilities 7 

regulation detroit edison’s power generation business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including the mpsc the ferc and the nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edison’s fermi 2 nuclear plant since 1996 there have been several important acts orders court rulings and legislative actions in the state of michigan that affect our power generation operations in 1996 the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s electric customers access to electricity supplied by other generators and marketers in 1998 the mpsc authorized the electric customer choice program that allowed for a limited number of customers to purchase electricity from suppliers other than their local utility the local utility would continue to transport the electric supply to the customers’ facilities thereby retaining distribution margins the electric customer choice program was phased in over a threeyear period with all customers having the option to choose their electric supplier by january 2002 in 2000 the michigan legislature enacted legislation that reduced electric rates by 5 and reaffirmed january 2002 as the date for full implementation of the electric customer choice program this legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing rate increases for small business customers through 2004 and for residential customers through 2005 the legislation and an mpsc order issued in 2001 established a methodology to enable detroit edison to recover stranded costs related to its generation operations that may not otherwise be recoverable due to electric customer choice related lost sales and margins the legislation also provides for the recovery of the costs associated with the implementation of the electric customer choice program the mpsc has determined that these costs will be treated as regulatory assets additionally the legislation provides for recovery of costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes laws and other governmental actions including the clean air act in 2004 the mpsc issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases totaling 374 million and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for electric customer choice customers the increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap the interim order affirmed the resumption of the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism for both capped and uncapped customers which reduced pscr revenues the mpsc also authorized the recovery of approximately 385 million in regulatory assets including stranded costs the final order addressed numerous issues relating to regulatory assets including the actual amounts recoverable and the recovery mechanism see note 4 – regulatory matters for additional information regarding the 2004 rate orders and our regulatory environment properties detroit edison owns generating properties and facilities that are primarily located in the state of michigan substantially all the net utility properties of detroit edison are subject to the lien of its mortgage power generation plants owned and in service as of december 31 2004 are as follows 8 

 

 

 strategy and competition we strive to be the preferred electricity supplier in southeast michigan we believe that we can accomplish our goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable low cost supplier of electricity to control expenses we optimize our fuel blends thereby taking maximum advantage of low cost environmentally friendly lowsulfur western coals to ensure generation reliability we will continue to make investments in our generating plants that will improve both plant availability and operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” section that follows effective january 2002 the electric customer choice program expanded in michigan whereby all of the company’s electric customers can choose to purchase their electricity from alternative suppliers of generation services detroit edison lost 18 of retail sales in 2004 12 in 2003 and 5 of such sales in 2002 as a result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose mpscauthorized full service rates exceed the cost of service we will continue to utilize the wholesale market to sell the generation made available by the electric customer choice program in order to lower costs for full service customers 9 

energy services description energy services has three business lines coalbased fuels onsite energy projects and power generation coalbased fuels energy services’ coalbased fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants the production of synfuel from all of the synfuel plants and the production of coke from one of the coke battery plants generate tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code section 29 is designed to stimulate investment in and development of alternate fuel sources we have private letter rulings from the irs for all of our synfuel plants synfuelrelated section 29 tax credits expire in 2007 section 29 tax credits for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002 with the third expiring in 2007 the synthetic fuel process involves chemically modifying and binding particles of coal to produce a fuel that is used for power generation and coke production the modification involves a threestep process that produces a solid synthetic fuel product since 2002 we have sold majority interests in eight of our nine synfuel plants representing approximately 92 percent of our total production capacity we anticipate selling a majority interest in our remaining 100 owned synfuel plant in 2005 we continue to consolidate these projects due to our controlling influence the coke battery facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within the steel industry dte energy is one of the largest independent producers in the us of coke for the steel industry  

 

onsite energy projects energy services owns andor operates onsite facilities including pulverized coal injection power generation steam production chilled water wastewater treatment and compressed air many of these facilities deliver utilitytype services to industrial commercial and institutional customers in 2004 we formed a utility services company that acquired utilityrelated assets from a large automotive company and entered into longterm agreements to provide utility and energy conservation services to the company we then sold a 50 interest in the project to an unaffiliated partner also in 2004 we 10 

purchased a 50 interest in a company that owns and operates a cogeneration facility serving a tissue mill located in mobile alabama power generation – nonutility energy services operates peaking and gasfired electric generating plants we have four electric generating plants in operation all located in the great lakes region in 2004 we sold two of the three units at our georgetown plant we have contracts for the sale of approximately 42 of the 2005 and 2006 output of the remaining units properties as of december 31 2004 coalbased fuels owns interests in and operates nine synfuel plants at eight production sites additionally we have interests in three coke battery facilities in the united states two of which we operate

strategy and competition our strategy for energy services is to continue leveraging our extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy business we will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell a majority interest in our remaining synfuel plant in 2005 we also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory environment the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our interrelated businesses as we expand from our current regional focus as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns we plan to focus on the following areas for growth  energy marketing  trading description energy marketing  trading consists of the wholesale electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading inc and dtecoenergy llc coenergy energy marketing  trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions for large customers as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants pipeline and storage assets in pursuing these goals energy marketing  trading may enter into forwards futures swaps and option contracts strategy and competition our strategy for energy marketing  trading is to deliver valueadded services to our customers we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we plan to focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we compete with electric and gas marketers traders utilities and other energy providers we have risk management and credit processes to monitor and minimize risk 12 

coal services description coal services provides fuel transportation and equipment management services tailored to the individual requirements of each customer we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers our external customers include electric utilities merchant power producers integrated steel mills and large industrial companies with significant energy requirements we also operate a number of railcar maintenance and repair facilities serving coal transporters as well as other industries and rail car types we participate in the trading of coal and emissions credits as well as coaltopower tolling transactions in 2003 we entered into the waste coal recovery business by purchasing a patented technology and constructing our first commercial facility  

 

 includes intercompany transactions 

properties we lease approximately 2600 rail cars we own fixed and mobile rail car maintenance and repair facilities in nebraska and indiana we completed construction of a waste coal recovery facility on the site of a former operating coal mine in ohio strategy and competition we continue to leverage our position as one of the top north american coal marketers and our reputation as an efficient manager of transportation assets trends such as railroad and mining consolidation and the financial uncertainty of many mining firms could have an impact on how we compete in the future we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers we acquired the rights to a proprietary technology that produces high quality coal products from fine coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations waste coal recovery the technology has the additional benefit of improving the environment by allowing us to restore the land in accordance with reclamation requirements of each state the technology produces a finecoal fuel by removing mineral matter claylike impurities and oxides from waste material the finecoal fuel can be used in power plants as a feedstock for synthetic fuel production and for other industrial applications our first facility in ohio became operational in late2003 we have experienced certain complications with our feedstock excavating process we are working to resolve these complications and increase our production capacity to more than 500000 tons of fine coal per year we believe that the waste coal recovery business has the potential to contribute significantly to future earnings and provide significant environmental benefits biomass description biomass develops owns and operates landfill gas recovery systems in the us landfill gas a byproduct of solid waste decomposition is composed of approximately equal portions of methane and carbon dioxide converting the methane into a renewable energy resource conserves fossil fuels some biomass operations generate section 29 tax credits that will expire in 2007 13 

biomass helps limit potential greenhouse gas emissions by developing and implementing landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and use it productively such a recovery system eliminates detrimental air emissions by preventing methane from escaping into the atmosphere or migrating offsite and becoming a safety hazard landfill gas recovery systems also provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy applications for this form of energy include steam and electricity generation fueling of asphalt plants and brick kilns and for processing into pipeline quality gas in 2004 biomass entered into a joint venture with coal services to acquire facilities that produce coal mine methane gas  

 

dte energy’s portion of total tax credits generated 

properties biomass operates 29 sites located in 12 states and other projects are under development strategy and competition biomass’ strategy capitalizes upon our industry experience of over 20 years we are evaluating business growth through both development and acquisitions we compete primarily with fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal however we believe the environmental benefits of biomass along with reasonable and economic access to landfill sites provide a platform for future growth energy distribution utility – power distribution description the electric distribution services of detroit edison comprise our utility power distribution business this business distributes electricity generated by energy resources’ power generation business and alternative energy suppliers to detroit edison’s 21 million customers in southeastern michigan this business also shares with the gas distribution segment the customer service and regulated marketing functions for our utilities accordingly costs associated with these functions including collections and customer service activities are shared between power distribution and gas distribution in january 2003 we sold the steam heating business of detroit edison to thermal ventures ii lp in february 2003 we sold itc to an affiliate of kohlberg kravis roberts  co and trimaran capital partners llc itc will continue to provide transmission services to the energy distribution business at rates that will be recovered from detroit edison’s utility customers weather and economic factors affect our sales and revenues similar to the power generation business our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands power distribution’s sales are not dependent upon a limited number of customers although customers participating in the electric customer choice program do not impact the total number of power distribution customers they do impact operating revenues electric choice customers currently pay a lower distribution rate than full service customers accordingly customers participating in the electric customer choice program unfavorably affect revenues detroit edison filed a 14 

rate restructuring proposal in february 2005 to eliminate this intra class rate subsidy note 4 the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on power distribution  

 

 represents deliveries for self generators who have purchased power from alternative energy suppliers to supplement their power requirements 

regulation detroit edison’s power distribution is subject to the jurisdiction of the mpsc which has regulatory authority over rates conditions of service and other operatingrelated matters as previously discussed michigan legislation prevents detroit edison from increasing rates to residential customers through 2005 and prevented rate increases for small business customers through 2004 in january 2004 the mpsc issued an order adopting rules governing service quality and reliability standards for electric distribution systems the reliability standards establish performance levels for service restoration wiredown relief requests customer call answer time customer complaint response meter reading and new service installations the order also establishes penalties for delays in service restoration during normal conditions catastrophic storms and repetitive outages detroit edison is required to file an annual report providing information regarding performance against the measures provided and any penalties incurred in 2004 the mpsc issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases totaling 374 million and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for electric customer choice customers the increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap the mpsc also authorized the recovery of approximately 385 million in regulatory assets including stranded costs the final order addressed numerous issues relating to regulatory assets including the actual amounts recoverable and the recovery mechanism see note 4 – regulatory matters for additional information regarding the 2004 rate orders and our regulatory environment energy assistance programs energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to detroit edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses detroit edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive we are working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 15 

properties detroit edison owns and operates 667 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 31381500 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 415000 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 24792000 kva substantially all of the net utility properties of detroit edison are subject to the lien of its mortgage circuit miles of distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2004 are as follows  

 

there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between detroit edison and electricity providers external to our service area these interconnections are generally owned and operated by itc and connect to neighboring energy companies strategy and competition our strategy focuses on improving reliability restoration time and the quality of customer service and lowering operating costs by improving operating efficiencies we also are targeting capital investments in areas that have the greatest impact on reliability improvements with the goal of managing distribution rates charged to utility customers the decision to sell itc was consistent with our strategic view that maximization of shareholder value and high levels of customer service are best achieved with assets that we own operate and over which we exercise significant control by ferc order rates charged by itc to detroit edison were frozen through december 2004 thereafter rates became subject to normal ferc regulation with the mpsc’s november 2004 final rate order transmission costs are recoverable through detroit edison’s pscr mechanism competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the onsite generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term distributed generation description distributed generation primarily consisting of dte energy technologies dtech invests in emerging technologies that complement our existing businesses we currently have businesses that develop assemble market distribute and service distributed generation products provide application engineering and monitor and manage system operations in 2004 dtech revised its strategy to reduce the losses that occurred in the development phase of the business over the past four years as a result we closed most of our sales offices and created two regional selling offices located in southern california and in michigan these offices will concentrate on highermargin sales additionally dtech’s organization was reduced and realigned to be more efficient 16 

also in 2004 dtech purchased the assets of the developer and assembler of its continuous duty products ranging from 75kw to 150kw the above changes along with reduction of dtech’s operating expenses are expected to improve the financial performance of this business strategy and competition our goal is to become a profitable participant in the emerging distributed generation market providing onestop shopping that meets customers’ total energy needs our strategy is to increase focus on our proprietary preengineered and packaged continuous duty generation products competition in the distributed generation business comes from distributors and manufacturers of standby and continuous duty generators the success of this business depends on the continued development of new products refinement of existing products the expansion of customer acceptance of continuous duty distributed generation and our ability to execute our plans energy gas utility – gas distribution description gas distribution operations primarily consist of michcon our gas utility gas distribution provides gas sales and transportation delivery services to 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers located throughout michigan gas distribution makes gas sales primarily to residential and smallvolume commercial and industrial customers it provides end user transportation to largevolume commercial and industrial customers and gas customer choice customers who purchase natural gas directly from other suppliers and utilize michcon’s pipeline network to transport the gas to the customers’ facilities gas distribution provides intermediate transportation to producers brokers and other gas companies that own the natural gas transported but are not the ultimate consumers michcon’s revenues and net income are impacted by weather and are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the year due to heatingrelated demand michcon’s operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on michcon the following table details sales and deliveries to these customers  

 

we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms supply under contract represents approximately 58 of the expected 188 bcf of supply requirements in 2005 we expect to meet the balance of gas supply requirements through open market purchases we expect that 20 of our 2005 purchases will be under fixedprice contracts with the remaining 80 acquired at prevailing market prices as a result of varying demand primarily due to weather michcon may use existing gas in inventory to meet unanticipated customer obligations given the geographic diversity of supply coupled with its 124 bcf of storage capacity michcon believes it can meet the supply requirements for customers michcon has longterm firm transportation agreements expiring on various dates through 2011 for delivery of purchased natural gas to our distribution system regulation michcon is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters michcon is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health in the late 1990s the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s natural gas customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower gas costs resulting from competition in 1999 the mpsc approved a comprehensive experimental threeyear gas customer choice program that allowed an increasing number of customers to purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility in december 2001 the mpsc issued an order that continued the gas customer choice program on a permanent and expanding basis the permanent gas customer choice program was phased in over a threeyear period with all customers having the option to choose their gas supplier by april 2004 since michcon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on michcon’s earnings under the december 2001 mpsc order michcon returned to a gas cost recovery gcr mechanism effective january 2002 under this mechanism michcon’s gas sales rates include a gas commodity component designed to recover its actual gas costs and therefore does not have a commodity price risk for prudently incurred gas costs in september 2003 michcon filed an application with the mpsc for an increase in service and distribution charges base rates for its gas sales and transportation customers the filing requests an overall increase in base rates of 194 million per year approximately 7 increase inclusive of gas costs beginning january 1 2005 in september 2004 the mpsc issued an order granting interim rate relief of 35 million annually to michcon a final order is expected in the first quarter of 2005 see note 4  regulatory matters for additional information regarding the september 2004 interim rate order and our regulatory environment energy assistance programs energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable expenses as previously discussed we are working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory 18

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dte energy is a diversified energy company with approximately 7 billion in revenues in 2004 and approximately 21 billion in assets at december 31 2004 we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern michigan additionally we have numerous nonutility subsidiaries involved in energyrelated businesses predominantly in the midwest and eastern us a significant portion of our earnings is derived from our utility operations synthetic fuel business and energy marketing and trading operations earnings in 2004 were 431 million or 249 per diluted share down from 2003 earnings of 521 million or 309 per diluted share as discussed in the “results of operations” section that follows the comparability of earnings was impacted by discontinued businesses and the adoption of new accounting rules excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes earnings from continuing operations in 2004 were 443 million or 255 per diluted share compared to earnings of 480 million or 285 per diluted share for the same 2003 period income reflects reduced contributions from our utility operations partially offset by increased contributions from our nonutility businesses and corporate  other significant items that influenced our 2004 financial performance andor may affect future results are       electric customer choice program  since 2002 michigan residents and businesses have had the option of participating in the electric customer choice program this program is designed to give all customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower power costs resulting from competition however detroit edison’s rates are regulated by the michigan public service commission mpsc while alternative suppliers can charge marketbased rates this regulation has hindered detroit edison’s ability to retain customers in addition the mpsc has maintained regulated rates for certain groups of customers that exceed the cost of service to those customers this has resulted in high levels of participation in the electric customer choice program by those customers that have the highest rates relative to their cost of service primarily commercial and industrial businesses as a result our margins continue to be affected to address this issue we filed a revenue neutral rate restructuring proposal in february 2005 designed to adjust rates for each customer class to be reflective of the full costs incurred to service such customers under the proposal detroit edison’s commercial and industrial rates would be lowered in 2006 but residential rates would increase over a fiveyear period beginning in 2007 the number and mix of customers participating in the electric customer choice program could be impacted under the rate restructuring lost margins and electricity volumes associated with electric customer choice were approximately 237 million and 9245 gigawatthours gwh in 2004 this compares with lost electric customer choice margins and volumes of approximately 120 million and 6193 gwh in 2003 the financial impact of electric customer choice was affected by the issuance of electric interim and final rate orders that increased base rates authorized transition charges and reaffirmed the resumption of the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism as subsequently discussed partially offsetting the impact of lost margins on income we recorded regulatory assets representing stranded costs that we believe are 30 

recoverable under existing michigan legislation and mpsc orders there are a number of variables and estimates that impact the level of recoverable stranded costs including weather sales mix and transition charges as a result our estimate of stranded costs could increase or decrease as subsequently discussed the mpsc authorized the recovery of 44 million in stranded costs for the period of january 2002 through february 2004 detroit edison rate orders along with the rate restructuring proposal address certain issues with the electric customer choice program however current regulation continues to hinder our ability to retain certain customers accordingly we will continue working with the mpsc and michigan legislature to address other issues associated with the electric customer choice program electric rate orders  in 2000 public act pa 141 froze electric rates for all residential commercial and industrial customers through 2003 the legislation also prevented rate increases or capped rates for small commercial and industrial customers through 2004 and for residential customers through 2005 the rate freeze and caps apply to base rates as well as rates designed to recover fuel and purchased power costs which has traditionally been a cost passthrough under the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism in 2004 the mpsc issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases totaling 374 million and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for electric customer choice customers the increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap the interim order affirmed the resumption of the pscr mechanism for both capped and uncapped customers which reduced pscr revenues by 115 million in 2004 however the order allowed detroit edison to increase base rates for customers still subject to a cap in an equal and offsetting amount to the change in the pscr factor to maintain the total capped rate levels in effect for these customers the mpsc also authorized the recovery of approximately 385 million in regulatory assets including stranded costs as a result of rate caps regulatory asset adjustments and other factors the rate orders decreased 2004 earnings by 15 million the impact of the rate orders is expected to increase earnings in 2005 and 2006 as rate caps expire  

 

 see note 4 for a further discussion of the mpsc’s interim and final rate orders gas interim rate order  in september 2003 michcon filed an application with the mpsc for an increase in service and distribution charges base rates for its gas sales and transportation customers the filing requested an overall increase in base rates of 194 million annually approximately 7 increase inclusive of gas costs beginning january 1 2005 in september 2004 michcon received an interim order in this rate case authorizing an increase in base rates of 35 million annually effective september 22 2004 the interim rate order increased earnings by approximately 6 million in 2004 michcon expects a final order from the mpsc in the first quarter of 2005 31 

operating costs  during 2004 we experienced increases in operation and maintenance costs primarily within our electric and gas utilities the increases were driven by higher costs associated with pension and postretirement benefits and uncollectible accounts receivable pension and postretirement benefits expense totaled 212 million in 2004 compared to 172 million in 2003 the increase is due to financial market performance lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs additionally the recoverability of pension and health care benefits costs were part of our electric and gas rate filings the mpsc approved a pension tracking mechanism in detroit edison’s final rate order that provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in base rates the mpsc also required detroit edison to propose a similar tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs detroit edison filed a request with the mpsc in february 2005 seeking authority to implement a tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables especially within our energy gas operations the increase is attributable to economic conditions high natural gas prices and the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts expense for the two utilities increased to 105 million in 2004 compared to 76 million for the corresponding 2003 period we are taking aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables including customer disconnections contracting with collection agencies and working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of lowincome funding allocated to our customers in michcon’s current gas rate filing we addressed numerous operating cost issues including uncollectible accounts receivable expense the mpsc staff supports a provision proposed by michcon that would allow michcon to recover or refund 90 of uncollectible accounts receivable expense above or below the amount that is reflected in base rates we support the mpsc staff’s recommendation and believe the provision would significantly reduce our risk of high uncollectible gas accounts receivable to partially address this issue of rising costs we continue to employ the dte energy operating system which is the application of tools and practices to obtain operating efficiencies and enhance operating performance we are targeting over 100 million in savings during 2005 through the application of operating system principles weather  earnings in our electric and gas utilities are seasonal and sensitive to weather electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utility’s results are driven by cold winter weather we experienced both milder summer and winter weather during 2004 which negatively impacted sales demand the lower demand reduced current year earnings by 27 million compared to 2003 additionally we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages the impact of storms on our current year earnings was significantly lower than in 2003 which was affected by several catastrophic wind and ice storms as well as by the august 2003 blackout restoration and other costs associated with stormrelated power outages lowered 2004 pretax earnings by 48 million compared to 72 million in 2003 synthetic fuel operations  we operate nine synthetic fuel production plants at eight locations since 2002 we have sold majority interests in eight of the nine plants representing approximately 92 of our total production capacity synfuel facilities chemically change coal including waste and marginal coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable internal revenue service irs rules section 29 of the internal revenue code provides tax credits for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal synfuelrelated tax credits expire in december 2007 operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses which have been more than offset by the resulting section 29 tax credits in order to 32 

recognize section 29 tax credits a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income in the year the tax credit is generated once earned the tax credits are utilized subject to certain limitations but can be carried forward indefinitely we have not had sufficient taxable income to fully utilize tax credits earned in prior periods as of december 2004 we had 483 million in tax credit carryforwards in order to optimize income and cash flow from our synfuel operations we have sold majority interests in eight of our nine facilities and intend to sell a majority interest in the remaining plant during 2005 representing 99 of our production capacity when we sell an interest in a synfuel project we recognize the gain from such sale as the facility produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured gain recognition is dependent on the synfuel production qualifying for section 29 tax credits and the value of such credits as subsequently discussed in substance we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base the value of a section 29 tax credit can vary each year and is adjusted annually by an inflation factor as published by the irs in april of the following year additionally the value of the tax credit in a given year is reduced if the “reference price” of oil within the year exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if the reference price exceeds a phaseout price the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil which in recent years has been 3 — 4 lower than the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for light sweet crude oil the actual or estimated reference price and beginning and ending phaseout prices per barrel of oil for 2003 2004 and 2005 are as follows  

 

numerous recent events have significantly increased domestic crude oil prices including terrorism stormrelated supply disruptions and strong worldwide demand as of february 1 2005 the nymex closing price of a barrel of oil to be delivered in march 2005 was 4712 which is comparable to a 4347 reference price assuming that such price was to continue for an entire year for 2005 and later years if the reference price falls within or exceeds the phaseout range the availability of tax credits in that year would be reduced or eliminated respectively as previously discussed until the gain recognition criteria is met gains from selling interests in synfuel facilities will be deferred it is possible that gains will be deferred in the first second andor third quarters of each year until there is persuasive evidence that no tax credit phase out will occur for the applicable calendar year this could result in shifting earnings from earlier quarters to later quarters of a calendar year as discussed in notes 12 and 13 we have entered into derivative and other contracts to economically hedge approximately 65 of our 2005 synfuel cash flow exposure related to the risk of an increase in oil prices we are continuing to evaluate the current volatility in oil prices and alternatives available to mitigate our unhedged exposure to oil prices as part of our synfuelrelated risk management strategy assuming no synfuel tax credit phase out in future years we expect cash flow from our synfuel business to total approximately 16 billion between 2005 and 2008 the source of synfuel cash flow includes cash from operations asset sales and the utilization of section 29 tax credits carried forward from synfuel production prior to 2004 nonutility growth  during 2004 we continued to experience growth in our nonutility businesses with income reaching 283 million compared to 256 million in 2003 the improvement primarily reflects increased contributions in our energy marketing  trading segment primarily due to a onetime contract gain additionally nonutility growth in 2004 is attributable to increased earnings from our synfuels coke 33 

batteries and onsite energy projects also affecting the year over year comparison are asset gains losses and impairments during 2004 and 2003 as subsequently discussed outlook  we made significant progress during the past year on our 2004 corporate priorities which included      our longterm strategy has not changed and in 2005 we will focus on maintaining a strong utility base pursuing a unique growth strategy focused on value creation in targeted markets maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying an attractive dividend the impact of the rate orders is expected to increase utility earnings in 2005 and 2006 as rate caps expire our financial performance will be dependent on successfully redeploying an expected 165 billion of cash flow through 2008 primarily associated with proceeds from the sale of interests in synfuel facilities our objective for cash redeployment is to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios as well as replace the value of synfuels that is currently inherent in our share price we will first use our cash to reduce parent company debt secondly we will continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria lastly share repurchases will be used to build share value if adequate investment opportunities are not available results of operations we had earnings of 431 million in 2004 or 249 per diluted share compared to earnings of 521 million or 309 per diluted share in 2003 and earnings of 632 million or 383 per diluted share in 2002 as subsequently discussed the comparability of earnings was impacted by our two discontinued businesses international transmission company and southern missouri gas company and the adoption of two new accounting rules in 2003 excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes our earnings from continuing operations in 2004 were 443 million or 255 per diluted share compared to earnings of 480 million or 285 per diluted share in 2003 and earnings of 586 million or 355 per diluted share in 2002 the following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments operating performance and future outlook segment performance  outlook – through 2004 we operated our businesses through three strategic business units energy resources energy distribution and energy gas each business unit had utility and nonutility operations the balance of our business consisted of corporate  other this resulted in the following reportable segments in 2005 we expect to realign our business units as discussed in note 1  

 

 

 

energy resources utility — power generation the power generation plants of detroit edison comprise our regulated power generation business detroit edison’s numerous fossil plants its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant generate electricity the generated electricity supplemented with purchased power is sold principally throughout michigan and the midwest to residential commercial industrial and wholesale customers factors impacting income power generation earnings decreased 173 million in 2004 and 6 million in 2003 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed these results primarily reflect reduced gross margins and increased operation and maintenance expenses 35 

 

 

 

gross margins declined 186 million during 2004 and 135 million in 2003 the declines were due primarily to lost margins from retail customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program as well as reduced cooling demand resulting from mild summer weather as a result of electric customer choice penetration detroit edison lost 18 of retail sales in 2004 compared to 12 of such sales during 2003 the loss of retail sales under the electric customer choice program also resulted in lower purchase power requirements as well as excess power capacity that was sold in the wholesale market under the 2004 interim and final rate orders previously discussed revenues from selling excess power reduce the level of recoverable fuel and purchased power costs and therefore do not impact margins associated with uncapped customers the rate orders also lowered pscr revenues which were partially offset by increased base rate and transition charge revenues weather in 2004 was 3 milder than 2003 resulting in lost margins of 25 million weather in 2003 was also milder than the prior year resulting in lost margins of 114 million the decline in margins and revenues in 2004 was also due to the allocation of a smaller portion of detroit edison’s billings to power generation operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs decreased in 2004 and 2003 reflecting a 127 per megawatt hour mwh 8 decline in fuel and purchased power costs during 2004 and a 64 per mwh 4 decline during 2003 fuel and purchased power costs are a passthrough with the reinstatement of the pscr in 2004 and therefore do not affect margins or earnings associated with uncapped customers the decrease in fuel and purchased power costs is attributable to lower priced purchases and the use of a more favorable power supply mix driven by higher generation output the favorable mix is due to lower purchases driven by lost sales under the electric customer choice program the comparison was also 36 

affected by higher costs associated with substitute power purchased to meet customer demand during the august 2003 blackout we were required to purchase additional power during the 36day period it took for our generation fleet to return to preblackout capacity  

 

 

 

 

 operation and maintenance expense increased 44 million in 2004 and 2 million in 2003 the 2004 increase reflects costs associated with maintaining our generation fleet including costs of scheduled and forced plant outages additionally the increase in 2004 is due to incremental costs associated with the implementation of our dte2 project a companywide initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems including finance human resources supply chain and work management operation and maintenance expense in both years includes higher employee pension and health care benefit costs due to financial market performance discount rates and health care trend rates expenses in 2003 were also affected by 5 million in costs associated with the august 2003 blackout depreciation and amortization expense increased 48 million in 2004 and decreased 107 million in 2003 the variations reflect the income effect of recording regulatory assets which lowered depreciation and amortization expenses the regulatory asset deferrals totaled 107 million in 2004 and 153 million in 2003 representing net stranded costs and other costs we believe are recoverable under pa 141 other income and deductions expense increased 17 million in 2004 and decreased 40 million in 2003 the 2004 increase is primarily due to lower income associated with recording a return on regulatory assets as well as costs associated with addressing the structural issues of pa 141 the 2003 decrease is attributable to lower interest expenses and increased interest income interest expense reflects lower borrowing levels and rates and interest income includes the accrual of carrying charges on environmentalrelated regulatory assets outlook – future operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings new legislation changes in market prices of power coal and gas plant performance changes in economic conditions weather and the levels of customer participation in the electric customer choice program 37 

as previously discussed we expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk due to the electric customer choice program until the issues associated with this program are addressed we will accrue as regulatory assets our unrecovered generationrelated fixed costs stranded costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation and mpsc orders we have addressed certain issues of the electric customer choice program in our february 2005 rate restructuring proposal we cannot predict the outcome of these matters in conjunction with the sale of the transmission assets of itc in february 2003 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc froze itc’s transmission rates through december 2004 it is expected that annual rate adjustments pursuant to a formulistic pricing mechanism beginning in january 2005 will result in an estimated increase in detroit edison’s transmission expense of 50 million annually additionally in a proceeding before the ferc several midwest utilities seek to recover transmission revenues lost as a result of a ferc order modifying the pricing of transmission service in the midwest detroit edison estimates that its potential obligation as a result of this proceeding could be 22 million per month from december 2004 through march 2005 and 1 million per month from april 2005 through march 2006 detroit edison is expected to incur an additional 15 million in 2005 for charges related to the implementation of midwest independent transmission operator’s open market as previously discussed detroit edison received rate orders in 2004 that allow for the recovery of increased transmission expenses through the pscr mechanism see note 4 – regulatory matters energy services energy services is comprised of coalbased fuels onsite energy projects and nonutility power generation coalbased fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants the production of synthetic fuel from all of our synfuel plants and the production of coke from one of our coke batteries generate tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code onsite energy projects include pulverized coal injection power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply power generation owns and operates four gasfired peaking electric generating plants and manages and operates two additional gasfired power plants under contract additionally power generation develops operates and acquires coal and gasfired generation factors impacting income  energy services earnings decreased 11 million in 2004 and increased 17 million in 2003 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed these results primarily reflect higher gains recognized from selling majority interests in our synfuel plants varying levels of section 29 tax credits a gain from contract termination uncollectible accounts writtenoff and losses on synfuel hedges 38 

 

 

 

operating revenues increased 160 million in 2004 and 284 million in 2003 reflecting higher synfuel coal and coke sales as well as increased revenues from our onsite energy projects the improvement in synfuel revenues results from increased production due to additional sales of project interests in 2004 and 2003 reflecting our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests in order to optimize income and cash flow as previously discussed operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses which have been more than offset by the resulting section 29 tax credits when we sell an interest in a synfuel project we recognize the gain from such sale as the facility produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds to the company have become fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured in substance we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold coal marketing revenues in 2004 have also been affected by our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests this strategy resulted in the reduction of synfuel production levels we were contractually obligated to supply coal to customers at certain sites that did not produce synfuel as a result of our current production strategy to meet our obligations to provide coal under longterm contracts with customers we acquired coal that was resold to customers the coal was sold at prices higher than the prices at which synfuel would have been sold to these customers 39 

revenues from coke sales were higher in 2004 due to higher coke sales volumes combined with higher market prices due to limited supplies of coke in the us revenues from onsite energy projects increased in 2004 reflecting the completion of new longterm utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large manufacturer of paper products revenues in 2004 include a 9 million pretax fee generated in conjunction with the development of a related energy project 50 of which was sold to an unaffiliated partner operation and maintenance expense increased 139 million in 2004 and 341 million in 2003 reflecting costs associated with synfuel production and coke operations partially offsetting the higher synfuel operating costs in 2004 was the recording of insurance proceeds associated with an accident at one of our coke batteries operation and maintenance expense in 2003 was affected by a 30 million pretax gain from the termination of a tolling agreement at one of our generation facilities substantially offset by the establishment of a 28 million pretax reserve for receivables associated with a large customer that filed for bankruptcy gains on sale of interests in synfuel projects increased 136 million in 2004 and 43 million in 2003 the improvements are due to additional sales of majority interests in our synfuel projects to hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce synfuel sales proceeds we entered into derivative and other contracts covering approximately 65 of our 2005 synfuel cash flow exposure the derivative contracts are accounted for under the mark to market method with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains we recorded a mark to market loss during the 2004 fourth quarter which reduced 2004 synfuel gains by 12 million pretax see note 12 for further discussion minority interest increased 121 million in 2004 and 54 million in 2003 reflecting our partners’ share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during 2004 and 2003 resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our partners income taxes increased 313 million in 2004 and 19 million in 2003 reflecting higher taxable earnings and a decline in the level of section 29 tax credits due to the sale of interests in synfuel facilities outlook  energy services will continue leveraging its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy business we expect solid earnings from our onsite energy business in 2005 as a result of executing longterm utility services contracts in 2004 energy marketing  trading energy marketing  trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading and coenergy dte energy trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants coenergy focuses on physical gas marketing and the optimization of dte energy’s owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and gas storage capacity to this end both companies enter into derivative financial instruments as part of their marketing and hedging strategies including forwards futures swaps and option contracts most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives factors impacting income  energy marketing  trading’s earnings increased 47 million in 2004 consisting of a 4 million improvement at dte energy trading and a 43 million improvement at coenergy earnings increased 20 million in 2003 of which 18 million was attributable to dte energy trading and 2 million to coenergy dte energy trading’s earnings improvement in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to realized margins associated with shortterm physical trading and origination activities 40 

 

 

 

 coenergy’s earnings in 2004 and 2003 were affected by varying gains and losses on economic hedge contracts related to storage assets as subsequently discussed in the “ outlook ” section the unrealized gains and losses of economic hedge contracts are required to be recognized under marktomarket accounting while the offsetting unrealized losses and gains on the underlying asset positions are not recognized coenergy’s earnings in 2004 reflect a 74 million onetime pretax gain from modifying a future purchase commitment under a transportation agreement and terminating a related longterm gas exchange storage agreement with an interstate pipeline company under the gas exchange agreement we received gas from the customer during the summer injection period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season the realized and unrealized margins comparison for both dte energy trading and coenergy was affected by our decision in late 2003 to monetize certain inthemoney derivative contracts while simultaneously entering into replacement atthemarket contracts the monetizations were completed in conjunction with implementing a series of initiatives to improve cash flow and fully utilize section 29 tax 41 

credits although the monetizations did not impact earnings they had the effect of decreasing realized margins and increasing unrealized margins on economic hedges in 2004 and having the opposite effect on margins in 2003 outlook – energy marketing  trading will seek to manage its business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and customtailored bundled services to largevolume end users and utilities this capacity coupled with the synergies from dte energy’s other businesses positions the segment to add value significant portions of the energy marketing  trading portfolio are economically hedged the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory as well as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage assets the financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not considered derivatives for accounting purposes as a result energy marketing  trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets the majority of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle which runs annually from april of one year to march of the next year our strategy is to economically hedge the price risk of all gas purchases for storage with sales in the overthecounter forwards and futures markets current accounting rules require the marking to market of forward sales and futures but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse by the end of each storage cycle see “fair value of contracts” section that follows nonutility — other our other nonutility businesses include our coal services and biomass units coal services provides fuel transportation and rail equipment management services we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers additionally we participate in coal trading and coaltopower tolling transactions as well as the purchase and sale of emissions credits coal services has formed a subsidiary dte peptec inc which uses proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries typically discarded from coal mining operations biomass develops owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the us gas produced from many of these landfill sites qualifies for section 29 tax credits factors impacting income  earnings increased 3 million in 2004 and declined 9 million in 2003 the 2004 increase reflects higher sales from coal and emissions credits partially offset by increased costs associated with our waste coal operations the 2003 decline reflects reduced marketing and tolling income as well as an increase in operating costs associated with ramping up the dte peptec business our first waste coal facility in ohio became operational in late 2003  

 outlook – we expect to continue to grow our coal services and biomass units we believe a substantial market could exist for the use of dte peptec inc technology and we continue to modify and prove out this technology coal services and biomass have formed a new subsidiary to enter the coal mine methane business we purchased coal mine methane assets in illinois at the end of 2004 and expect to reconfigure equipment and restart operations by mid2005 42 

the section 29 tax credits generated by biomass are subject to the same phase out risk if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels as detailed in the synthetic fuel operations discussion see note 13 energy distribution utility — power distribution power distribution operations include the electric distribution services of detroit edison power distribution distributes electricity generated and purchased by energy resources and alternative energy suppliers to detroit edison’s 21 million customers factors impacting income  power distribution earnings increased 71 million during 2004 and decreased 94 million in 2003 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed these results primarily reflect varying operating revenues and operation and maintenance expenses as well as a nonrecurring loss recorded in 2003  

 

 operating revenues increased 111 million in 2004 primarily due to an increase in base rates resulting from the interim and final rate orders the 2004 improvement is also attributable to residential sales growth and the allocation of a higher portion of detroit edison’s billings to power distribution partially offset by the effects of milder weather operating revenues decreased 96 million in 2003 reflecting mild summer weather and the impact of slower economic conditions operation and maintenance expense decreased 1 million in 2004 and increased 75 million in 2003 the operation and maintenance expense comparability was affected by 2003 restoration costs associated with three catastrophic storms and the august 2003 blackout both years were also affected by an increase in 43 

reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable reflecting high past due amounts attributable to economic conditions and an increase in employee benefit costs additionally the comparisons were affected by incremental costs associated with our dte2 project implementation a 22 million pretax loss in 2003 from the sale of our steam heating business and the accrual of refunds in 2004 and 2003 associated with transmission services outlook – operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as weather changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms we experienced numerous catastrophic storms over the past few years the effect of the storms on annual earnings was partially offset by storm insurance we have been unable to obtain storm insurance at economical rates and as a result we do not anticipate having insurance coverage at levels that would significantly offset unplanned expenses from ice storms tornadoes or high winds that damage our distribution infrastructure nonutility nonutility energy distribution operations consist of dte energy technologies which assembles markets distributes and services distributed generation products provides application engineering and monitors and manages onsite generation system operations factors impacting income  nonutility results declined 4 million in 2004 and improved 1 million in 2003 the 2004 decrease includes an impairment charge for an “other than temporary” decline in the fair value of an investment in a joint venture that supplied certain distributed generation equipment and materials to dte energy technologies outlook – dte energy technologies will focus on sales of proprietary preengineered and packaged continuous generation products in key applications this will likely result in nearterm revenue decline but we anticipate gross profit margins will improve combined with continuing cost reductions and resumption of sales growth we believe these actions will lead to improved financial performance in 2005 44 

energy gas utility — gas distribution gas distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily provided by michcon our gas utility that purchases stores distributes and sells natural gas to 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers located throughout michigan factors impacting income gas distribution’s earnings declined 9 million in 2004 and 37 million in 2003 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed results primarily reflect varying gross margins higher operation and maintenance expenses and a nonrecurring loss recorded in 2003  

gross margins increased 22 million in 2004 and decreased 6 million in 2003 compared to the prior year the improvement in 2004 reflects the impact of interim rate relief and additional margin from the acceleration of several midstream services contracts partially offsetting these improvements were lower sales and end user transportation deliveries due to milder weather the gross margin comparison was also affected by a 265 million pretax reserve recorded in 2003 for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to an mpsc order in michcon’s 2002 gas cost recovery gcr plan case note 4 operating revenues and cost of gas increased significantly in 2004 and 2003 reflecting higher gas prices which are recoverable from customers through the gcr mechanism  

operation and maintenance expense increased 29 million in 2004 and 74 million in 2003 reflecting higher reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and pension and health care costs the increase in uncollectible accounts expense reflects high past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices continued weak economic conditions and a lack of adequate public assistance for lowincome customers other income and deductions expense increased 12 million in 2004 and decreased 5 million in 2003 reflecting a 2003 gain on sale of interests in a series of real estate partnerships income taxes in 2004 and 2003 were impacted by lower earnings and favorably affected by an increase in the amortization of tax benefits previously deferred in accordance with mpsc regulations outlook – operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings weather and changes in economic conditions higher gas prices and economic conditions have resulted in an increase in past due receivables we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates however failure to make continued progress in collecting past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control uncollectible accounts receivable expenses we are working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory as a result of the continued increase in operating costs michcon filed a rate case in september 2003 to increase rates by 194 million annually to address future operating costs and other issues michcon received an interim order in this rate case in september 2004 increasing rates by 35 million annually the mpsc staff has recommended a provision that would allow michcon to recover or refund 90 of uncollectible accounts receivable expense above or below the amount that is reflected in base rates see note 4 – regulatory matters nonutility nonutility operations include the gas production business and the gas storage pipelines  processing business our gas production business produces gas from proven reserves in northern michigan and sells the gas to the energy marketing  trading segment gas storage pipelines  processing has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field as well as lease rights to another natural gas storage field the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy entities factors impacting income  earnings decreased 8 million in 2004 and increased 3 million in 2003 the decline in 2004 is due to gains recorded in 2003 from selling our 16 pipeline interest in the portland natural gas transmission system as well as from selling certain gas properties excluding those gains income increased 2 million reflecting the acquisition of an additional 15 ownership in the vector 46 

pipeline in late 2003 increased sales of transportation capacity by vector pipeline and increased storage sales throughout 2004 outlook – we anticipate further expansion of our storage facilities and vector pipeline to take advantage of available growth opportunities we are also seeking to secure markets for our 105 interest in the millennium pipeline we expect to continue developing our gas production properties in northern michigan and leverage our experience in this area by pursuing investment opportunities in unconventional gas production outside of michigan during 2004 we acquired approximately 50000 leasehold acres in the southern region of the barnett shale in texas an area of increasing production we began drilling test wells in december 2004 and anticipate drilling a significant number of additional test wells in the first half of 2005 initial results from the test wells are expected in mid2005 if the results are successful we could commit up to 350 million of capital over the next several years to develop these properties corporate  other corporate  other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting legal and information technology as these functions essentially support the entire company their costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized and therefore the effect of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year additionally corporate  other holds certain nonutility debt and investments including assets held for sale and in emerging energy technologies factors impacting income  corporate  other results improved 47 million in 2004 compared to a 1 million decline in 2003 the 2004 improvement was affected by a 14 million net of tax gain from the sale of 35 million shares of plug power stock note 1 as well as lower michigan single business taxes resulting from tax saving initiatives results for 2003 include a 15 million cash contribution to the dte energy foundation funded with proceeds received from the sale of itc corporate  other also benefited from lower financing costs and increased intercompany interest income in both periods discontinued operations southern missouri gas company smgc  we own smgc a public utility engaged in the distribution transmission and sale of natural gas in southern missouri in 2004 management approved the marketing of smgc for sale under us generally accepted accounting principles we classified smgc as a discontinued operation in 2004 and recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately 7 million representing the writedown to fair value of the assets of smgc less costs to sell and the writeoff of allocated goodwill in november 2004 we entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of smgc following receipt of regulatory approvals and resolution of other contingencies it is anticipated that the transaction will close in 2005 international transmission company  in february 2003 we sold itc our electric transmission business to affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co and trimaran capital partners llc accordingly we classified itc as a discontinued operation the sale generated a preliminary net of tax gain of 63 million in 2003 the gain was net of transaction costs the portion of the gain that was refundable to customers and the write off of approximately 44 million of allocated goodwill the gain was lowered to 58 million in 2004 under the mpsc’s november 2004 final rate order that resulted in a revision of the applicable transaction costs and customer refund we had income from discontinued operations of 5 million in 2003 see note 3 for further discussion cumulative effect of accounting changes as required by us generally accepted accounting principles on january 1 2003 we adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy trading activities the cumulative effect of 47 

adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2003 earnings by 27 million see note 2 for further discussion capital resources and liquidity dte energy and its subsidiaries require cash to operate and cash is provided by both internally and externally generated sources we manage our liquidity and capital resources to maintain financial flexibility to meet our current and future cash flow needs cash requirements we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonutility businesses in addition to retiring and paying interest on longterm debt and paying dividends our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2005 of up to 11 billion the capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2005 primarily as a result of dte2 and environmental spending we began implementing the dte2 project in 2003 the company expects the project to incrementally cost approximately 150 million to 175 million the epa ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us detroit edison estimates that it will spend approximately 100 million in 2005 and incur up to an additional 13 billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements the full recovery of 550 million of environmental expenditures was authorized in the mpsc’s november 2004 final rate order nonutility capital spending will approximate 100 million to 300 million annually for the next several years capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria debt maturing in 2005 excluding securitization debt totals approximately 410 million we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital requirements 48 

 

cash from operating activities a majority of the company’s operating cash flow is provided by our two utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather electric customer choice sales loss regulatory deferrals regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs our nonutility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range of operating profiles the profiles vary from our synthetic fuels business which we believe will provide over 16 billion in cash through 2008 to new startups these new startups include our unconventional gas and waste coal recovery businesses which we are growing and if successful could require significant investments although dte energy’s overall earnings were 431 million in 2004 cash from operations totaling 995 million was up 45 million from the comparable 2003 period the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over 300 million in net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains substantially offset by a 259 million increase in working capital and other requirements a portion of this improvement is attributable to the change in our strategy to primarily produce synfuel from plants in which we have sold interests as previously discussed synfuel projects generate operating losses which have been more than offset by tax credits that we have been unable to fully utilize thereby negatively affecting operating cash flow cash for working capital primarily reflects higher income tax payments of 172 million in 2004 reflecting a different payment pattern of taxes in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase in working capital was mitigated by company initiatives to improve cash flow including better inventory management cash sales transactions deferral of retirement plan contributions and the utilization of letters of credit certain cash initiatives in 2003 lowered cash flow in 2004 49 

our net operating cash flow in 2003 was 950 million reflecting a 46 million decline from 2002 the decrease was attributable to lower utility net income after adjusting for noncash items partially offsetting the declines were lower working capital and other requirements reflecting company initiatives to improve cash flow and optimize synfuel operations the improvement in 2003 working capital was achieved despite a 222 million contribution to our pension plans outlook – we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm primarily due to improvements from utility rate increases and the sales of interests in our synfuel projects this will be partially offset by higher cash requirements primarily within our gas storage business we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through cash improvement initiatives operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in 2005 but will be affected by the level of sales migration under the electric customer choice program and the ability of the mpsc within the regulatory processes to put in place a customer choice program that has sound economic fundamentals in addition the customer choice program’s impact will also be determined by the success of the company in addressing certain structural flaws within additional regulatory proceedings and the legislative process another factor affecting utility cash flows is the degree and timing of rate relief within the electric and gas rate cases based on the final and interim orders issued by the mpsc in 2004 approximately 50 million of additional revenues were realized in the 2004 calendar year due to the structure of the interim and final rate orders we will not realize the full benefits of interim and final rate relief until 2006 when all customer rate caps expire improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better management of our working capital requirements including the continued focus on reducing past due accounts receivable our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be centered around cash generation and conservation cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to total approximately 16 billion between 2005 and 2008 the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet we expect to use this cash to reduce debt to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict riskreturn and value creation criteria and to potentially repurchase common stock if adequate investment opportunities are not available our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios in order to improve our current credit ratings and outlook and to more than replace the value of synfuels cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to approximate 400 million in 2005 the source of synfuel cash flow includes cash from operations excluding certain working capital changes asset sales and the utilization of section 29 tax credits carried forward from synfuel production prior to 2004 our other operating nonutility businesses are expected to contribute approximately 400 million through 2008 remaining startup businesses such as unconventional gas production waste coal recovery and distributed generation will continue to use cash in excess of their cash generation over the next couple of years while they are being further developed certain of the previously discussed cash initiatives resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in 2004 which will have the impact of lowering cash flow in 2005 cash from investing activities cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets in any given year we will look to harvest cash from underperforming or nonstrategic assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements capital spending within our nonutility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and some expansion the balance of nonutility spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will 50 

not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we invest tentatively based on research and analysis based on a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings net cash relating to investing activities declined 691 million in 2004 and improved 11 billion in 2003 compared to the prior year the changes were primarily due to proceeds received in 2003 totaling 758 million from the sale of itc interests in three synfuel projects and nonstrategic assets additionally the changes are due to variations in cash contractually designated for debt service longer term with the expected improvement at our utilities and continued cash generation from the synfuel business cash flows are expected to improve we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategic financial and risk criteria cash from financing activities we rely on both shortterm borrowings and longerterm financings as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by the company’s operations shortterm borrowings which are mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities dte energy and its subsidiaries have a total of 1675 billion in credit facilities which provide liquidity to our commercial paper programs and support the use of letters of credit  

borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing shortterm interest rates the agreements require each of the companies to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 65 to l and an “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” ebitda to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1 dte energy has significant room under these provisions with coverage totaling 43 to 1 and leverage at 489 to 1 at december 31 2004 the companies are currently in compliance with these financial covenants should either detroit edison or michcon have delinquent debt obligations of at least 25 million to any creditor such delinquency will be considered a default under dte energy’s credit agreements these agreements have standard material adverse change mac clauses however the agreements expiring in october 2009 include a provision that the mac clause does not apply when borrowings are made to repay maturing commercial paper additionally detroit edison has a 200 million shortterm financing agreement secured by customer accounts receivable the agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts receivable detroit edison is currently in compliance with these covenants for additional information see note 10 — shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings 51 

our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we continually evaluate our leverage target which is currently 50 or lower to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our longterm debt and strengthening our balance sheet the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs net cash used for financing activities improved 727 million in 2004 and declined 10 billion in 2003 compared to the prior periods the 2004 change was primarily due to higher issuances of new long and shortterm debt and fewer repurchases of longterm debt the 2003 change was due to higher redemptions of longterm debt and lower proceeds from issuances of new debt and common stock for additional information on debt issuances and redemptions see note 9 — longterm debt and preferred securities amounts available under shelf registrations include 500 million at dte energy and 150 million at detroit edison michcon does not have current shelf capacity in 2005 we plan on filing new shelf registration statements for michcon and detroit edison common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash in january 2005 we announced the dte energy board has authorized the repurchase of up to 700 million in common stock through 2008 the authorization provides company management with flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time and will depend on future cash flows and investment opportunities in january 2005 we discontinued issuing new dte energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan which generated approximately 50 million annually we also contributed 170 million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of 2004 contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2004  

 credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities management believes that the current credit ratings of the company provide sufficient access to the capital markets however disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte 52 

energy may affect the company’s ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors in november 2004 moody’s investors service and fitch ratings downgraded michcon in december 2004 standard  poor’s downgraded dte energy detroit edison and michcon the ratings reflect weaker credit metrics due to decreased cash flows mainly stemming from increased operation and maintenance costs without sufficient regulatory relief additional unfavorable changes in our ratings could restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various nonutility subsidiaries in the event that our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately 356 million at december 31 2004 additionally our trading business could be required to restrict operations and our access to the shortterm commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future reviews the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating agencies all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities

critical accounting estimates there are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment such estimates relate to regulation risk management and trading activities section 29 tax credits goodwill pension and postretirement costs the allowance for doubtful accounts and legal and tax reserves regulation a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 71 “ accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation ” application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of our businesses if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no 71 on all our operations we estimate that the extraordinary loss would be as follows 53

tax credits generated by our facilities were 449 million in 2004 as compared to 387 million in 2003 and 351 million in 2002 the portion of tax credits generated for our own account were 38 million in 2004 as compared to 241 million in 2003 and 250 million in 2002 with the remaining credits generated allocated to third party partners outside firms assist us in assuring we operate in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the law as well as calculating the value of tax credits goodwill certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations notes 2 and 16 in accordance with sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in order to perform these impairment tests we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation techniques which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings as of december 31 2004 our goodwill totaled 21 billion the majority of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units with approximately 772 million allocated to the utility energy gas reporting unit the value of the utility reporting units is significantly impacted by rate orders and the regulatory environment the utility energy gas reporting unit is comprised primarily of michcon we have made certain cash flow assumptions for michcon that are dependent upon the successful outcome of the outstanding gas rate case note 4 these assumptions may change when we receive a final rate order which is expected during the first quarter of 2005 based on our 2004 goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed we will continue to monitor regulatory events and evaluate their impact on our valuation assumptions and the carrying value of the related goodwill while we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ from our projections pension and postretirement costs our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors including rates of return on plan assets the discount rate the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of 81 million in 2004 47 million in 2003 and pension income of 9 million in 2002 postretirement benefits costs for all plans were 125 million in 2004 118 million in 2003 and 70 million in 2002 pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2004 is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 90 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated input from our consultants including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns are based on broad equity and bond markets our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 65 in equity markets 28 in fixed income markets and 7 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe 90 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a threeyear period because of this method the future value of assets 55 

will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded we have unrecognized net gains due to the recent favorable performance of the financial markets as of december 31 2004 we had 63 million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 625 at december 31 2003 to 60 at december 31 2004 due to recent financial market performance lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates we estimate that our 2005 pension costs will approximate 96 million compared to 81 million in 2004 and our 2005 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 155 million compared to 125 million in 2004 in the last several years we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design additionally future pension costs for detroit edison will be affected by a pension tracking mechanism which was authorized by the mpsc in its november 2004 rate order the tracking mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in detroit edison’s base rates lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by 10 would have increased our 2004 qualified pension costs by approximately 24 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by 10 would have increased our pension costs for 2004 by approximately 8 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by 10 would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2004 by approximately 17 million the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the financial markets the value of our plan assets increased from 24 billion at december 31 2002 to 29 billion at december 31 2003 the value at december 31 2004 increased to 33 billion the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional minimum pension liability an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders’ equity at december 2002 2003 and 2004 the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without substantial returns in the financial markets we made a 35 million cash contribution to the pension plan in 2002 a 222 million cash contribution in 2003 and a 170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in 2004 we also contributed 33 million to the postretirement plans in 2002 and contributed 80 million to the postretirement plans in 2004 we did not contribute to the postretirement plans in 2003 we do not anticipate making a contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2005 at the discretion of management we anticipate making a 0 to 40 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2005 in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act was signed into law this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law the effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced costs by 16 million in 2004 see note 14 – retirement benefits and trusteed assets for a further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans 56 

allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers historical trends economic conditions age of receivables and other information higher customer bills due to increased gas prices the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2003 and 2004 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow legal and tax reserves we are involved in legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate legal reserves are based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings against the company tax reserves are based upon management’s assessment of potential adjustments to tax positions taken we regularly review ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience in addition to current tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments environmental matters protecting the environment as well as correcting past environmental damage continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators legislation andor rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including detroit edison the environmental protection agency epa and the michigan department of environmental quality have aggressive programs to cleanup contaminated property air  the epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us detroit edison has spent approximately 580 million through december 2004 and estimates that it will spend up to 100 million in 2005 detroit edison estimates it will incur from 700 million to 13 billion of additional future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements recovery of costs to be incurred through december 2004 was provided for in our november 2004 electric rate order see note 4 –regulatory matters the epa has initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of the clean air act asserting that older coalfired power plants have been modified in ways that would require them to comply with the more restrictive “new source” provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison the united states district court for the southern district of ohio eastern division issued a decision in august 2003 finding ohio edison company in violation of the new source provisions of the clean air act if the court’s decision is upheld the electric utility industry could be required to invest substantial amounts on pollution control equipment during the same month however a district court in a different division rendered a conflicting decision on the matter on october 27 2003 the epa promulgated new rules effective december 26 2003 allowing repair replacement or upgrade of production equipment without triggering source requirement controls if the cost of the parts and repairs do not exceed 20 of the replacement value of the equipment being upgraded such repairs will be considered routine maintenance however any changes in emissions would be subject to existing pollution permit limits and other state and federal programs for pollutants several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and on december 24 2003 were granted a stay until the us court of appeals dc circuit hears the arguments on the case we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison water  in july 2004 the epa published final regulations establishing performance standards for reducing fish loss at existing power plant cooling water intake structures these regulations require individual facility studies and possible intake modifications that will be determined and implemented 57 

over the next five to seven years it is estimated that we will incur up to 50 million in additional capital expenditures for detroit edison contaminated sites  dte enterprises inc michcon and citizens owns or previously owned 18 former manufactured gas plant mgp sites during the mid1980’s enterprises conducted preliminary environmental investigations at former mgp sites and some contamination related to the byproducts of gas manufacturing was discovered at each site enterprises employed outside consultants to evaluate remediation alternatives and associated costs for these sites as a result of these studies enterprises accrued a liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of 24 million at december 31 2004 the reserve balance was 24 million of which 45 million was classified as current our current estimates indicate that the previously accrued amounts are adequate to cover the costs of required remedial actions detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites including two former mgp sites the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations the findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is approximately 8 million which is expected to be incurred over the next several years as a result of the investigation detroit edison accrued approximately 8 million liability during 2004 dte energy operating system and dte2 during 2002 we adopted the dte energy operating system which is the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems among other enhancements operation and maintenance expenses benefited from our companywide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies and enhance operating performance we expect continued cost containment efforts and process improvements in 2003 we began the implementation of dte2 a companywide initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems including finance human resources supply chain and work management we expect to incrementally spend approximately 150 million to 175 million over the life of the project we expect the benefits to outweigh this investment primarily from lower costs faster business cycles repeatable and optimized processes enhanced internal controls improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs we are in process of launching the first phase of our multiyear dte2 project although our implementation plan includes detailed testing and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and successful transition we can provide no assurance that complications will not arise that could interrupt our operations new accounting pronouncements see note 2– new accounting pronouncements for discussion of new pronouncements  fair value of contracts the following disclosures are voluntary and we believe provide enhanced transparency of the derivative activities and position of our energy trading  marketing segment and our other businesses we use the criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted to determine if certain contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments the rules for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex moreover significant judgment is required to determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently if a contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument it is recorded in the 58

 items 1  2 business  properties general in 1995 dte energy incorporated in the state of michigan our regulated operations consist primarily of detroit edison and michcon we also have numerous nonregulated subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing and trading energy services and various other electricity coal and gas related businesses dte energy is an exempt holding company under the public utility holding company act puhca of 1935 except section 9 a 2 that relates to the acquisition of securities of public utility companies and section 33 that relates to the acquisition of foreign nonus utility companies detroit edison is a michigan corporation organized in 1903 detroit edison is a public utility subject to regulation by the mpsc and ferc and is engaged in the generation purchase distribution and sale of electric energy to 21 million customers in a 7600 square mile area in southeastern michigan michcon is a michigan corporation organized in 1898 michcon became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of dte energy in conjunction with the acquisition of mcn energy which was subsequently merged into enterprises which was completed on may 31 2001 see note 3 for a further discussion of the mcn energy acquisition michcon is a public utility subject to regulation by the mpsc michcon is engaged in the purchase storage transmission distribution and sale of natural gas to 12 million customers in a 14700 square mile area throughout michigan in february 2003 we sold the international transmission company itc a ferc regulated transmission company see note 3 for a further discussion of the itc sale and its presentation as a discontinued operation our website is wwwdteenergycom available free of charge on our website is information such as previously filed reports with the sec press releases and other informational resources regarding dte energy and our subsidiaries the information on our website is updated as soon as reasonably practicable the information on our

website wwwsecgov references in this report to “we” “us” “our” or “company” are to dte energy and its subsidiaries collectively 5 we operate our businesses through three strategic business units energy resources energy distribution and energy gas the balance of our business consists of corporate  other based on this structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance each business unit has regulated and nonregulated operations and contributed to dte energy’s 2003 diluted earnings per share of 309 see note 16  segment and related information for financial information by segment for the last three years a discussion of each business follows energy resources power generation description power generation comprises our regulated power generation business and plants within detroit edison these plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including the mpsc the nrc and the epa electricity is generated from detroit edison’s numerous fossil plants its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant and purchased from electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers the electricity we produce and purchase is sold to four major classes of customers residential commercial industrial and wholesale principally throughout michigan the midwest and ontario canada weather economic factors and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other coolingrelated demands power generation sales are made to a diverse base of customers in both type and number sales levels are not dependent on any small market segment however due to residential rate subsidization less than 1 of the customers constitute approximately 80 of the power 6 generation margin additionally business customers who have elected to participate in the electric customer choice program are having a significant unfavorable effect on our financial performance our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with market purchases the table below details our energy supply mix and average cost per unit   we expect an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers the effect of lost sales due the electric customer choice program has reduced our need for purchased power and increased our ability to sell power in the wholesale market we have short and longterm supply contracts for expected fuel and purchased power requirements as detailed in the following table  power generation’s generating capability is heavily dependent upon coal the coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms detroit edison expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases detroit edison has contracts with three coal suppliers for a total purchase of up to 28 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2004 through 2008 detroit edison also has a contract with a supplier for the purchase of approximately 4 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2004 through 2006 these existing longterm coal contracts include provisions for price escalation as well as deescalation given the geographic diversity of supply detroit edison believes it can meet the expected generation requirements we own and lease a fleet of rail cars and have longterm transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities we purchase power from other electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers these purchases supplement our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles for example when high temperatures occur during the summer we require additional electricity to meet demand this access to additional power is an efficient and economical way to meet our obligation to customers without increasing capital expenditures to build additional baseload power facilities 7 regulation detroit edison’s power generation business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies including the mpsc ferc and nrc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edison’s fermi 2 nuclear plant since 1996 there have been several important acts orders court rulings and legislative actions in the state of michigan that affect our power generation operations in 1996 the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s electric customers access to electricity supplied by other generators and marketers in 1998 the mpsc authorized the electric customer choice program that allowed for a limited number of customers to purchase electricity from suppliers other than their local utility the local utility would continue to transport the electric supply to the customers’ facilities thereby retaining distribution margins the electric customer choice program was phased in over a threeyear period with all customers having the option to choose their electric supplier by january 2002 in 2000 the michigan legislature enacted legislation that reduced electric rates by 5 and reaffirmed january 2002 as the date for full implementation of the electric customer choice program this legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing rate increases for residential customers through 2005 and for small business customers through 2004 the legislation and an mpsc order issued in 2001 established a methodology to enable detroit edison to recover stranded costs related to its generation operations that may not otherwise be recoverable due to electric customer choice related lost sales and margins the legislation also provides for the recovery of the costs associated with the implementation of electric customer choice program the mpsc has determined that these costs be treated as regulatory assets additionally the legislation provides for recovery of costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes laws and other governmental actions including the clean air act due to mpsc orders issued in 1997 and 1998 that altered the regulatory process in michigan and provided a plan for transition to electric customer choice for the generation business of detroit edison effective december 1998 detroit edison’s generation business no longer met the criteria of sfas no 71 “ accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation ” since the june 2000 legislation was enacted into law and with the issuance of subsequent clarifying mpsc orders in 2001 and 2002 rates for retail customers and transition charges for electric customer choice customers will be set to recover detroit edison’s generation costs such costs will be billed and recovered from both retail and choice customers and thus satisfy the criteria of sfas no 71 in addition we have the legislative authority to defer regulatory costs in 2002 and 2003 and to begin recovery of such costs starting in 2004 after the mandated rate freeze expires the recovery of these costs is dependent on authorization from the mpsc as a result we resumed application of sfas no 71 for our generation business in the fourth quarter of 2002 in june 2003 detroit edison filed an application with the mpsc for a change in retail electric rates resumption of the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism and recovery of net stranded costs detroit edison is specifically requesting authority to increase rates by 427 million annually with a threeyear phase in as customers’ rate caps expire in february 2004 the mpsc authorized an interim base rate increase of 248 million annually for additional information regarding our regulatory environment see note 4  regulatory matters 8 properties detroit edison owns generating properties and facilities that are all located in the state of michigan substantially all the net utility properties of detroit edison are subject to the lien of its mortgage power generation plants owned and in service as of december 31 2003 are as follows   strategy and competition we continue to strive to be the preferred electricity supplier in southeast michigan we believe that we can accomplish our goal by working with our customers communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable low cost supplier of electricity to control expenses we optimize our fuel blends thereby taking maximum advantage of low cost environmentally friendly lowsulfur western coals to ensure generation reliability we will continue to make investments in our generating plants that will improve plant availability and improve operating efficiencies revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” section that follows effective january 1 2002 the electric customer choice program expanded in michigan whereby all of the company’s electric customers can choose to purchase their electricity from alternative suppliers of generation services detroit edison lost 16 of retail sales in 2003 and 6 of such sales in 2002 as a result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program if regulatory or legislative changes are not made we expect to lose between 17 to 20 of retail sales in 2004 as a result of customers choosing to participate in the program customers participating in the electric customer choice program consist primarily of industrial and large 9 commercial customers there is a significant price difference in the wholesale and retail markets which only allows for partial offset of the lost revenue from customer choice migration we will continue to aggressively utilize the wholesale market to sell the generation made available by the electric customer choice program energy services description nonregulated energy services has three business lines coalbased fuels onsite energy projects and merchant generation coalbased fuels coalbased fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants both processes generate tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code section 29 is designed to stimulate investment in and development of alternate fuel sources we have private letter rulings from the irs for all of our synfuel plants synfuelrelated section 29 tax credits expire in 2007 section 29 tax credits for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002 with the third expiring in 2007 the synthetic fuel process involves chemically modifying and binding particles of coal to produce a fuel that is used for power generation and coke production the modification involves a threestep process that produces a solid synthetic fuel product during 2002 we sold a 95 interest in two of our synfuel plants and in 2003 we sold a 99 interest in one of our synfuel plants and a 59 interest in two other plants in january 2004 we sold an additional 40 interest in two of the previously sold plants reducing our interest to 1 we continue to consolidate these projects due to our controlling influence the coke battery facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within the steel industry dte energy is one of the largest producers in the us of coke for the steel industry during 2001 we sold a 49 interest in two of our coke battery projects and in 2002 consistent with the original purchase and sale agreement our third coke battery project interest was reduced from 95 to 5   onsite energy projects energy services owns andor operates onsite facilities including pulverized coal injection power generation steam production chilled water wastewater treatment and compressed air many of these facilities deliver utility services to industrial commercial and institutional customers merchant generation energy services develops and operates peaking and gasfired electric generating plants we have four electric generating plants in operation all located in the great lakes region we have contracts for 10 approximately 33 of the 2004 and 2005 output of these plants and lesser amounts contracted through 2008 properties as of december 31 2003 coalbased fuels owns interests in and operates nine synfuel plants at eight production sites additionally we have interests in three coke battery facilities in the united states two of which we operate coalbased fuels   the following are significant properties owned by onsite energy projects onsite energy projects   merchant generation  11 strategy and competition our strategy for energy services is to continue leveraging our extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy business we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell interests in all of our synfuel plants in 2004 we also continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations services to third parties we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining the markets in which to compete we examine closely the regulatory environment the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our interrelated businesses as we expand from our current regional focus as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns and then trend towards increased operational scale we plan to focus on the following areas for growth  energy marketing  trading description energy marketing  trading consists of the wholesale electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading company and coenergy we acquired coenergy as part of the mcn energy acquisition in may 2001 energy marketing  trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions for large customers as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants pipeline and storage assets  in pursuing these goals energy marketing  trading may enter into forwards futures swaps and option contracts strategy and competition our strategy for energy marketing  trading is to execute on our vision of the role energy trading plays in delivering valueadded services to our customers many of the former major market players have either ceased as going concerns or are no longer engaged in the energy trading business we seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we plan to focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we have risk management and credit policies to monitor and minimize risk coal services description coal services provides fuel transportation and equipment management services tailored to the individual requirements of each customer we specialize in minimizing energy production costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers our external customers include electric utilities merchant power producers integrated steel mills and large industrial companies with significant energy requirements we also operate a number of railcar maintenance and repair facilities serving coal transporters as well as other industries and rail car types we participate in the trading of coal and emissions credits as well as coaltopower tolling transactions during 2003 we entered into the waste coal recovery business by purchasing a patented technology and constructing our first commercial facility 12  properties we lease approximately 2600 rail cars we own fixed and mobile railcar maintenance and repair facilities in nebraska and indiana we completed construction of a waste coal recovery facility on the site of a former operating coal mine in ohio strategy and competition we continue to leverage our position as one of the top north american coal marketers and our reputation as an efficient manager of transportation assets trends such as railroad and mining consolidation and the financial uncertainty of many mining firms could have an impact on how we compete in the future we will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to the energy requirements of our customers we acquired the rights to a proprietary technology that produces high quality coal products from fine coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations the technology has the additional benefit of improving the environment by allowing us to restore the land in accordance with reclamation requirements of each state the technology produces a finecoal fuel by removing mineral matter claysized impurities and oxides from waste material the finecoal fuel can be used in power plants as a feedstock for synthetic fuel production and for other industrial applications our first facility in ohio became operational in late2003 and has the capacity to produce more than 500000 tons of fine coal per year we are negotiating an agreement for a second facility and plan to site three to five additional facilities in 2004 we believe that the waste coal recovery business will contribute significantly to future earnings and provide significant environmental benefits biomass description biomass develops owns and operates landfill gas recovery systems in the us landfill gas a by product of solid waste decomposition is composed of approximately equal portions of methane and carbon dioxide converting the methane into a renewable energy resource conserves fossil fuels biomass operations generate section 29 tax credits through 2007 biomass helps limit potential greenhouse gas emissions by developing and implementing landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and use it productively such a recovery system eliminates detrimental air emissions by preventing methane from escaping into the atmosphere or migrating offsite and becoming a safety hazard landfill gas recovery systems also provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy applications for this form of energy include steam and electricity generation fueling of asphalt plants and brick kilns and for processing into pipeline quality gas   13 properties biomass has 31 operating sites located in 14 states and other projects are under development strategy and competition biomass’ strategy capitalizes upon our industry experience of over 20 years we are evaluating business growth through both development and acquisitions we compete primarily with fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal however we believe the environmental benefits of biomass along with reasonable and economic access to landfill sites provide a platform for future growth energy distribution power distribution description the electric distribution services of detroit edison comprise our regulated power distribution business this business distributes electricity generated by energy resources’ power generation business and alternative electric suppliers to detroit edison’s 21 million customers in southeastern michigan this business also shares with the gas distribution segment the customer service function for our utilities accordingly costs associated with this function including collections our call center and uncollectable accounts receivable is shared between power distribution and gas distribution in january 2003 we sold the steam heating business of detroit edison to thermal ventures ii lp in february 2003 we sold itc to an affiliate of kohlberg kravis roberts  co and trimaran capital partners llc itc will continue to provide transmission services to the energy distribution business at rates that will be recovered from detroit edison’s utility customers weather and economic factors affect our sales and revenues similar to the power generation business our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and coolingrelated demands power distribution’s sales are not dependent upon a limited number of customers additionally customers participating in the electric customer choice program do not impact power distribution’s operating revenues or the number of customers served the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on power distribution  14 regulation detroit edison’s power distribution is subject to the jurisdiction of the mpsc and the ferc which have regulatory authority over rates conditions of service and other operatingrelated matters as previously discussed michigan legislation prevents detroit edison from increasing rates to residential customers through 2005 and for small business customers through 2004 by order of the ferc rates charged by itc will remain at current levels through december 2004 in june 2003 detroit edison filed an application with the mpsc for a change in retail electric rates resumption of the pscr mechanism and recovery of net stranded costs in february 2004 the mpsc authorized an interim base rate increase of 248 million annually see note 4 for further discussion of the electric transitional rate plan filing in january 2004 the mpsc issued an order adopting rules governing service quality and reliability standards for electric distribution systems the reliability standards establish performance levels for service restoration wiredown relief requests customer call answer time customer complaint response meter reading and new service installations the order also establishes penalties for delays in service restoration during normal conditions catastrophic storms and repetitive outages detroit edison is required to file an annual report providing information regarding performance against the measures provided and any penalties incurred for additional information regarding our regulatory environment see note 4 – regulatory matters energy assistance programs energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to detroit edison’s ability to control its uncollectable accounts receivable and collections expenses detroit edison’s uncollectable accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive we are working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory properties detroit edison owns and operates 663 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 31079000 kilovoltamperes kva and approximately 407000 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 24542000 kva substantially all of the net utility properties of detroit edison are subject to the lien of its mortgage circuit miles of distribution lines owned and in service as of december 31 2003 are as follows 15 electric distribution  there are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between detroit edison and electricity providers external to its service area these interconnections are owned and operated by itc and connect to neighboring energy companies strategy and competition our strategy focuses on improving the quality of customer service and lowering operating costs by improving operating efficiencies as well as targeting capital investments in areas that have the greatest impact on reliability improvements with the goal of managing distribution rates charged to utility customers the decision to sell itc is consistent with our strategic view that maximization of shareholder value and high levels of customer service are best achieved with assets that we own operate and over which we exercise significant control as detroit edison’s rates are designed to recover transmission costs billings to detroit edison from itc will be recovered from detroit edison’s utility customers rates charged by itc to detroit edison will by ferc order remain at current levels through december 2004 thereafter rates would be subject to normal ferc regulation and market forces competition in the regulated electrical distribution business is provided primarily by onsite generation by industrial customers and distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term distributed generation description distributed generation primarily consisting of dte energy technologies dtech has investments in emerging technologies that complement our existing businesses we currently develop market and distribute a portfolio of distributed generation products provide application engineering and monitor and manage system operations distributed generation units seek to generate safe clean reliable power at or near the point of use rather than at large central power stations which can also provide very high efficiencies due to effective use of waste heat distributed generation products can use a range of technologies including internal combustion engines external combustion engines miniturbines and fuel cells the number of megawatts mw of distributed generation delivered has increased since 2001 while the average unit size has also increased dtech has begun to shift more of its focus on larger industrial and commercial markets and in particular on continuous rather than standby generation and away from the relatively higher volume smaller margin residential and small commercial markets the following table details the distributed generation capacity delivered for the past three years 16  strategy and competition our goal is to become a profitable participant in the emerging distributed generation market providing onestop shopping that meets customers’ total energy needs key milestones toward this success include full commercialization of our internal combustion enginedriven products as well as our monitoring and system operations management our sales structure is in place and we are continuing to expand our project support capabilities both directly and with partners our strategy is to increase our focus on our proprietary preengineered and packaged continuous generation products provisions in current as well as proposed federal and state laws are expected to provide us additional opportunities via tax credits energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standards competition in the distributed generation business comes from distributors and manufacturers of standby and continuous duty generators the success of this business depends on the continued development of new products and the expansion of customer acceptance energy gas gas distribution description gas distribution operations primarily consist of michcon our regulated gas utility gas distribution provides gas sales and transportation delivery services to 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers located throughout michigan as previously discussed this business also shares with the power distribution segment the customer service function for our utilities the following table details sales and deliveries to these customers   gas distribution makes gas sales primarily to residential and smallvolume commercial and industrial customers it provides end user transportation to largevolume commercial and industrial customers and gas customer choice customers who purchase natural gas directly from other suppliers and utilize michcon’s pipeline network to transport the gas to the customers’ facilities gas distribution provides 17 intermediate transportation to producers brokers and other gas companies that own the natural gas transported but are not the ultimate consumers michcon’s revenues and net income are impacted by weather and are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the year due to heatingrelated demand michcon’s operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on michcon we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms  supply under contract represents approximately 75 of the expected 180 bcf of supply requirements in 2004 we expect to meet the balance of gas supply requirements through open market purchases as a result of varying demand primarily due to weather michcon may use existing gas in inventory to meet unanticipated customer obligations given the geographic diversity of supply coupled with its 124 bcf of storage capacity michcon believes it can meet the supply requirements for customers michcon has longterm firm transportation agreements expiring on various dates through 2011 for delivery of purchased natural gas to our distribution system regulation michcon is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters michcon is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health in the late 1990s the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s natural gas customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower gas costs resulting from competition in 1999 the mpsc approved a comprehensive experimental threeyear gas customer choice program that allowed an increasing number of customers to purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility the local utility would continue to transport the natural gas supply to the customers’ facilities thereby retaining distribution margins in december 2001 the mpsc issued an order that continues the gas customer choice program on a permanent and expanding basis beginning with the conclusion of the threeyear temporary program on march 31 2002 under the expanded program beginning april 1 2002 up to approximately 40 of customers could elect to purchase gas from suppliers other than michcon beginning in april 2003 up to approximately 60 of customers could participate and beginning april 2004 all 12 million of michcon’s gas customers could choose to participate since michcon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on michcon’s earnings under the december 2001 mpsc order michcon returned to a gas cost recovery gcr mechanism effective january 2002 under this mechanism michcon’s gas sales rates include a gas commodity component designed to recover its actual gas costs and therefore does not have a commodity price risk for prudently incurred gas costs during 2001 michcon was under a gas sales program and incurred commodity price risk associated with its ability to secure gas supplies at prices less than 295 per mcf in september 2003 michcon filed an application with the mpsc for an increase in service and distribution charges base rates for its gas sales and transportation customers the filing requests an 18 overall increase in base rates of 194 million per year approximately 7 increase inclusive of gas costs beginning january 1 2005 michcon has requested that the mpsc increase base rates by 154 million per year on an interim basis by april 1 2004 the interim request is based on a projected revenue deficiency for the test year 2004 for additional information regarding our regulatory environment see note 4  regulatory matters energy assistance programs energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon’s ability to control its uncollectable accounts receivable expenses as previously discussed we are working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of lowincome individuals in our service territory properties michcon owns distribution transmission and storage properties and facilities that are all located in the state of michigan at december 31 2003 michcon’s distribution system included approximately 18000 miles of distribution mains approximately 1148000 service lines and approximately 1279000 active meters michcon owns approximately 2600 miles of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect its storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas michcon owns properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 124 bcf substantially all of the net utility properties of michcon are subject to the lien of its mortgage strategy and competition the strategy of the gas distribution business is to expand our role as the preferred provider of natural gas in michigan as a result of more efficient furnaces and appliances we expect future revenues to remain at current levels or slightly decline to partially offset these factors we plan initiatives to expand our gas markets as well as by continuing to provide energyrelated services that capitalize on our expertise capabilities and efficient systems we also anticipate increased revenues through increased rates as a result of our rate case which was filed on september 30 2003 see note 4 competition in the gas business primarily involves alternate fuels and energy sources natural gas continues to be the preferred space and waterheating fuel developers select natural gas in new construction because of the convenience cleanliness and relative price advantage compared to propane fuel oil and other alternative fuels gas production description the gas production business owns one of the industry’s largest antrim gas reserve bases predominantly located in the northern portion of the lower peninsula of michigan our emphasis is on developing and producing the 3519 bcfe of proved reserves we owned as of december 31 2003 we drilled 80 wells 68 net of interest of others in 2003 with a success rate in excess of 90 wells drilled in the antrim shale formation have high success rates and low drilling costs and are therefore considered low risk gas production is also involved in the coal bed methane business which is a joint undertaking between energy gas and energy resources that leverages our gas capabilities with the skills and experience of other nonregulated businesses 19 properties the michigan properties had 232 bcfe of production in 2003 gas production does not anticipate adding a significant amount of new reserves to its 3519 bcfe of proven reserves at december 31 2003 strategy the gas production business is aggressively managing its michigan gas producing assets to maximize returns on investment we have operator responsibilities for our michigan properties with the goal of optimizing the costs of producing reserves gas production has rights to 94866 acres 81133 net of interest of others of undeveloped leases during 2004 gas production plans to continue developing this acreage in order to leverage our gas production capabilities and the skills and experience of other nonregulated businesses we will continue to invest in opportunities in the coal bed methane business as of december 31 2003 the coal bed methane business has rights to 4034 acres 3156 net of interest of others of undeveloped leases in oklahoma during 2004 the coal bed methane business plans to drill its first operated wells in oklahoma gas storage pipelines  processing description the gas storage pipelines  processing business has partnership interests in an interstate transmission pipeline vector pipeline vector seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a 97 bcf natural gas storage field additionally we lease a 425 bcf natural gas storage field located in michigan properties  strategy and competition gas storage pipelines  processing focuses on opportunities in the midwesttonortheast region that supply natural gas to meet growing demand we expect much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the united states to occur within the midatlantic and new england regions these regions currently lack the pipeline capacity and lowcost storage necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet growing demand vector is an interstate pipeline that is intended to fill a large portion of that need and is complemented by energy gas’ significant storage capacity gas storage pipelines  processing has interests in seven processing plants that extract carbon dioxide from antrim gas production making it suitable for transportation to nearby markets additionally we have contract rights in natural gas storage fields capable of storing up to 522 bcf we plan to continue identifying asset opportunities related to natural gas storage and transmission and working with other dte energy affiliates to secure the market required to support asset investment 20 corporate  other description corporate  other includes the administrative and general expenses of various corporate support functions such as accounting legal and information technology these functions essentially support the entire company and the related costs are allocated to the various segments based on services utilized additionally corporate  other holds certain nonregulated debt and investments including assets held for sale and in emerging energy technologies strategy and competition our energy technology strategy is to invest in a profitable portfolio of energy technology companies that facilitate the creation of new businesses and expand growth opportunities for existing dte energy businesses we seek to gain early experience in emerging energy sectors where energy trends and technologies may create potentially profitable opportunities the investment portfolio consists of direct investments in energy technology companies and venture funds environmental matters we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various chemicals on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers greater details on environmental issues are provided in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements  detroit edison detroit edison is subject to applicable permit requirements and to potentially increasing stringent federal state and local standards covering among other things particulate and gaseous stack emission limitations the discharge of waste into lakes and streams and the handling and disposal of waste material the us environmental protection agency epa issued ozone transport regulations and in december 2003 proposed additional emission regulations relating to ozone fine particulate and mercury air pollution the new rules have led to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and particulate emissions to comply with these new controls detroit edison has spent approximately 560 million through december 2003 and estimates that it will spend approximately 40 million in 2004 and incur up to an additional 12 billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements the epa initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject in october 2003 the epa promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review provisions going forward several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and in december 2003 the court stayed the implementation of the regulations until the us court of appeals dc circuit renders an opinion in the case we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison detroit edison is required to demonstrate that the cooling water intake structures at all of its facilities minimize adverse environmental impact detroit edison filed such demonstrations and in the event of a final adverse decision may be required to install additional control technologies to further minimize the impact 21 various state and federal laws regulate detroit edison’s handling storage and disposal of its waste materials the epa and the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property detroit edison has extensive land holdings and from time to time must investigate claims of improperly disposed contaminants detroit edison anticipates it will be periodically included in these types of environmental proceedings michcon and citizens prior to the construction of major natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured from processes involving coal coke or oil enterprises michcon and citizens a wholly owned gas utility located in adrian michigan owns or previously owned 18 such former manufactured gas plant mgp sites investigations have revealed contamination related to the byproducts of gas manufacturing at each site enterprises is remediating seven of the former mgp sites and conducting more extensive investigations at six other former mgp sites enterprises received mdeq closure of one site and a determination that it is not a responsible party for three other sites enterprises received closure from the epa in 2002 for one site while we cannot make any assurances we believe that a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the mpsc will prevent these costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations other our nonregulated affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we believe these nonregulated affiliates are in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements 22 risk factors there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energy’s regulated and nonregulated businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance electric customer choice – without regulatory and legislative changes the negative impact of the electric customer choice program will continue to impact our financial performance weather – weather significantly affects our operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow damage due to ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage our infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses competition – deregulation and restructuring in the electric and gas industry could result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could affect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of our regulated businesses rate regulation – we operate in a regulated industry our electric and gas rates are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be increased without their authorization we may be impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses there is no assurance that our currently pending electric and gas rate increases will be granted section 29 tax credits – we have generated section 29 tax credits from our synfuel coke battery biomass and gas production operations generating section 29 tax credits is important to minimizing our income tax expense although we have received favorable private letter rulings on all of our synfuel plants the generation of tax credits is subject to audit and review by the internal revenue service if we do not prevail through the administrative and legal processes there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized section 29 tax credits that could impact our earnings and cash flows four of our synfuel facilities are under audit by the irs for 2001 the value of future credits generated may be affected by new tax legislation the combination of overall industry audits of section 29 credits supply and demand for investment in credit producing activities and new tax legislation could hinder our plan to sell interests in tax credit properties that could have an impact on our earnings and cash flows we have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in our synfuel facilities credit ratings – increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating several of the credit agencies have placed a “negative outlook” on our ratings due primarily to the uncertainty regarding our electric and gas rate cases a downgrade in our rating could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs regional and national economic conditions – our businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve should national or regional economic conditions decline reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will result in decreased earnings and cash flow economic conditions in our service territory also impact our collections of accounts receivable environmental laws and liability – we are subject to numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we may also incur liabilities because of our emission of gases that may cause changes in the climate the regulatory environment is subject to significant change and therefore we cannot predict future issues 23 additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties operation of nuclear facilities – ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects detroit edison to significant additional risks these risks among others include plant security environmental regulation and remediation and operational factors than can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility supply and price of raw materials – we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity price fluctuation and supply disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate electricity our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our regulated gas customers we have hedging policies in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices labor relations – unions represent a majority of our employees a union choosing to strike as a negotiating tactic would have an impact on our business we have begun negotiations with unions for contracts expiring in 2004 and cannot predict the outcome an unfavorable outcome such as a strike could adversely impact the business unplanned outages – unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations this occurrence could result in spot market purchases of electricity in excess of our costs of generation access to capital markets and interest rates – our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses heightened concerns about the energy industry the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs cash flows from subsidiaries  cash flows from subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay dividends and interest would be restricted property tax reform – we are one of the largest payers of property taxes in the state of michigan should the legislature change how schools are financed we could face increased property taxes on our michigan facilities insurance – while we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism war or a combination of significant unforeseen events could impact our operations and economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance terrorism – damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets by terrorist groups would impact our operations energy trading markets – events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole a decline in the confidence in the energy trading market along with stricter credit requirements has led to a decrease in the number of trading entities resulting in decreased liquidity in the energy trading market 24 employees the table below shows our employees as of december 31 2003  there are several bargaining units for our represented employees of the 5674 represented employees 4695 are under contracts that expire in june through october 2004 the contracts of the remaining represented employees expire in 2005 through 2007 we have begun negotiations on the labor

directors and officers in their capacities as such are insured against liability for alleged wrongful acts to the extent defined under six insurance policies providing aggregate coverage in the amount of 150 million 25 













 item 3 legal proceedings we are involved in certain legal regulatory administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings include certain contract disputes environmental reviews and investigations audits inquiries from various regulators and pending judicial matters we cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings we regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss the resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in the period they are resolved for additional discussion on legal matters see the following notes to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dte energy is a diversified energy company with approximately 7 billion in revenues in 2003 and approximately 21 billion in assets at december 31 2003 we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern michigan additionally we have numerous nonregulated subsidiaries involved in energyrelated businesses predominantly in the midwest and eastern us the majority of our earnings are derived from utility operations and the production of synthetic fuel which qualifies for section 29 tax credits earnings in 2003 were 521 million or 309 per diluted share down from 2002 earnings of 632 million or 383 per diluted share earnings from continuing operations in 2003 were 480 million or 285 per diluted share compared to 2002 earnings from continuing operations of 586 million or 355 per diluted share the 18 decrease in income reflects significantly lower utility earnings partially offset by increased contributions from our nonregulated businesses our 2003 financial performance was primarily influenced by  weather – earnings in our electric and gas utilities are seasonal and extremely sensitive to weather electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utility’s results are driven by cold winter weather we experienced both milder summer and winter weather during 2003 which negatively impacted sales demand the lower demand reduced current year earnings by 64 million compared to 2002 which was an abovenormal weather demand year additionally we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages our current year earnings were affected by several catastrophic wind and ice storms as well as by the august blackout restoration and other costs associated with these power outages lowered 2003 earnings by an additional 31 million compared to 2002 electric customer choice program  the electric customer choice program as originally structured in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged marketbased rates for their electricity however detroit edison’s rates continue to be regulated by the mpsc while alternative suppliers can charge marketbased rates this continued regulation has hindered detroit edison’s ability to retain customers detroit edison’s results have been unfavorably impacted by the lack of recovery of lost margins and other costs associated with the electric customer choice program under michigan legislation we are allowed to recover net stranded costs associated with the electric customer choice program to date the mpsc has not fully implemented various provisions of michigan’s restructuring legislation specifically the mpsc  in addition the mpsc has maintained regulated rates for certain groups of customers that exceed the cost of service to those customers this has resulted in high levels of participation in the electric customer choice program by those customers that have the highest price relative to their cost of service as a result we continue to lose sales each year and are seeing an accelerating pace of migration towards the end of 2003 lost margins and electricity volumes associated with electric customer choice were 29 approximately 120 million and 7281 gigawatthour gwh in 2003 compared with 50 million and 3510 gwh in 2002 in february 2004 the mpsc authorized an interim base rate increase that recognized a revenue deficiency for lost choice revenues and eliminated transition credits and implemented a transition charge for choice customers the interim order is expected to reduce the level of choice sales volumes assuming no further changes to the current electric customer choice program we expect to continue losing margins and volumes in 2004 partially offsetting the impact of lost margins in 2003 we recorded regulatory assets of 68 million representing an estimate of stranded costs that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation based on the mpsc’s july 2003 order we do not believe that any of the stranded costs in years prior to 2003 are recoverable there are a number of variables and estimates that impact the level of recoverable stranded costs including weather sales mix and wholesale prices as a result our estimate of stranded costs could increase or decrease the actual amount of stranded costs to be recovered will ultimately be determined by the mpsc detroit edison addressed numerous issues with the electric customer choice program including stranded costs in its june 2003 rate filing and is also pursuing a legislative solution under the legislative solution we are proposing to limit customer choice program participation to customers whose electric demand is 1 mw or greater the continued delay in addressing the structural problems of the electric customer choice program and the timely and full recovery of stranded costs unfavorably impacts earnings and cash flow see note 4 for a further discussion of the electric customer choice program and the mpsc interim rate order electric and gas rate plans – in 2000 michigan legislation froze electric rates for all residential commercial and industrial customers through 2003 the legislation also prevented rate increases or capped rates for residential customers through 2005 and for small commercial and industrial customers through 2004 the rate freeze and caps apply to base rates as well as rates designed to recover fuel and purchased power costs historically these costs have been a passthrough under the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism in june 2003 detroit edison filed an application with the mpsc for 1 an increase in retail electric rates of 427 million annually 2 the resumption of the pscr mechanism and 3 the recovery of net stranded and other costs as permitted under michigan legislation detroit edison received an interim order in this rate case authorizing an increase in rates of 248 million annually as a result of rate caps and other factors the interim rate increase is only designed to increase revenues by 71 million in 2004 note 4 a final order is expected in the third quarter of 2004 the rate increase is effective for each customer class upon the expiration of the applicable rate cap period the rate request is designed to more accurately reflect among other things significantly higher cost of service levels that detroit edison has experienced over the past few years the recovery of net stranded costs electric customer choice implementation costs and other costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes laws and governmental actions are covered under michigan legislation however the mpsc has not approved a final mechanism to recover such costs and this has negatively affected our cash flow as part of its rate filing detroit edison has requested authorization to implement a 5year surcharge to recover these costs the mpsc deferred addressing this item until a final rate order is issued in september 2003 michcon filed an application with the mpsc for an increase in service and distribution charges for its gas sales and transportation customers totaling 194 million annually the rate increase would be michcon’s first since 1992 and is designed to recover significantly higher operating costs michcon expects an interim order in this case in mid2004 with a final order by january 2005 operating costs – during 2003 we experienced doubledigit increases in regulated operation and maintenance costs the increases were driven by higher costs associated with pension and health care benefits uncollectable accounts receivable and customer service initiatives to address this issue of rising costs we implemented several cost savings initiatives that partially offset these increases some of the initiatives were structural in nature whereas others were temporary examples of these initiatives included a hiring freeze a pause on discretionary spending and overtime restrictions additionally we 30 reduced employee compensation costs property and other taxes as well as interest costs through debt refinancings synthetic fuel operations  we operate nine synthetic fuel production plants at eight locations interests in two of the nine plants were sold in 2002 interests in three other plants were sold in november 2003 and additional interests were sold in january 2004 in two of the plants sold in 2003 we continue to wholly own the remaining four plants but intend to sell interests in all such plants in 2004 synfuel facilities chemically change coal including waste and marginal coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable irs rules section 29 of the internal revenue code provides tax credits for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal in addition to meeting various qualifying conditions a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income to earn the section 29 credits our 2003 earnings were unfavorably affected by our inability to sell interests in synfuel plants until late 2003 the irs suspended the issuance of private letter rulings plrs relating to synthetic fuel projects in may 2003 pending its review of issues concerning chemical change which is the basis for earning section 29 tax credits as a result of the irs suspension we were unable to complete the pending sale of interests in our synfuel projects in addition we experienced lower taxable earnings due to milder weather and continued cost and margin pressures the temporary delay in selling interests in the synfuel projects coupled with the lower taxable earnings resulted in our capacity to generate more credits than we could utilize these factors caused us to reduce our synthetic fuel production by approximately onehalf in june 2003 to optimize the tax credits generated from these facilities we began implementing a series of initiatives including the monetization of inthemoney gas swap derivative contracts to improve cash flow and increase taxable income thereby allowing us to more fully utilize our section 29 tax credits in october 2003 the irs concluded its assessment of the chemical change process involved in synfuel production and resumed issuing plrs the irs determined that the test procedures and results used by taxpayers were scientifically valid if the procedures were applied in a consistent and unbiased manner the conclusion of the irs assessment allowed us to complete the sale of interests in additional facilities and increase synfuel production levels for the balance of 2003 nonregulated growth – during 2003 we continued to experience growth in our nonregulated businesses with income reaching 199 million compared to 168 million in 2002 the significant improvement reflects increased contributions from our energy services segment due to higher synfuel production partially offset by the impact of certain coke batteryrelated section 29 tax credits expiring in 2002 additionally nonregulated growth in 2003 is attributable to increased margins in our energy marketing  trading segment we also realized gains in 2003 from the sale of our 16 interest in the portland natural gas transmission system an interstate pipeline company and the settlement of a tolling contract at one of our merchant generating facilities although dte energy’s overall earnings were down 18 in 2003 our cash from operations totaling 950 million was comparable to the prior year despite a 222 million cash contribution to our pension plan operating cash flow reflects our successful initiative in 2003 to conserve cash including better working capital management this initiative coupled with 233 million in lower capital expenditures and over 750 million from selling nonstrategic and other assets resulted in a lower debt to total capital ratio and a healthier balance sheet outlook  we are facing many challenges in 2004 to maintain earnings and cash flow levels while protecting a strong balance sheet our financial performance over the short term will be dependent on preserving healthy electric and gas utilities monetizing our synthetic fuel projects and continuing to grow our nonregulated businesses in a prudent manner remedying the structural issues of the electric customer choice program in michigan is a key priority for the organization these issues must be corrected to prevent the continued migration of customers to the choice program based on false market signals the potential implications to remaining customers over the longer term could be significantly higher electricity rates 31 the timing and ultimate amount of final rate relief granted in the current electric and gas rate cases will affect customer service levels and our financial performance cash flow and earnings from our utilities will remain under pressure until the regulatory uncertainties are resolved however we remain focused on good cash management and a healthy balance sheet we are aggressively pursuing the sales of interests in all of our remaining synthetic fuel projects in 2004 these sales in addition to previously completed sales are expected to provide a 200 million to 300 million boost to our cash flow in 2004 the availability of qualified buyers and the timing of these sales will impact this financial outcome in addition we are continuing to grow our nonregulated businesses in areas such as waste coal technologies coal bed methane production and onsite energy project development due to the regulatory uncertainties over the short term we remain disciplined and conservative in our pursuit of incremental growth investments results of operations we had income of 521 million in 2003 or 309 per diluted share compared to income of 632 million or 383 per diluted share in 2002 and income of 332 million or 216 per diluted share in 2001 the comparability of earnings was impacted by the sale of our transmission business international transmission company itc and the adoption of new accounting rules as subsequently discussed upon selling itc in february 2003 we classified this business as a discontinued operation excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes our earnings from continuing operations in 2003 were 480 million or 285 per diluted share compared to earnings of 586 million or 355 per diluted share in 2002 and earnings of 309 million or 201 per diluted share in 2001 the following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments operating performance and future outlook segment performance  outlook  we operate our businesses through three strategic business units energy resources energy distribution and energy gas each business unit has regulated and nonregulated operations the balance of our business consists of corporate  other based on this structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance this results in the following reportable segments 32   33 energy resources power generation the power generation plants of detroit edison comprise our regulated power generation business detroit edison’s numerous fossil plants its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant generate electricity the generated electricity supplemented with purchased power is sold principally throughout michigan and the midwest to residential commercial industrial and wholesale customers  factors impacting income power generation earnings decreased 6 million in 2003 and increased 102 million in 2002 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed these results primarily reflect changes in gross margins increased operation and maintenance expenses and the recording of higher regulatory deferrals which lowered depreciation and amortization expenses merger and restructuring charges associated with the 2001 mcn energy acquisition also impacted the comparability of results these charges represent costs associated with systems integration relocation legal accounting and consulting services as well as costs associated with a work force reduction plan the plan included early retirement incentives and voluntary separation agreements for employees in overlapping corporate support areas gross margins in 2003 declined 135 million due primarily to decreased cooling demand resulting from mild summer weather lost margins from customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program and lost margins from the august 2003 blackout weather in 2003 was 38 milder than 2002 resulting in lost margins of 114 million detroit edison lost 16 of retail sales in 2003 and 6 of such sales in 2002 as a result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program we estimate that we lost 120 million of margins in 2003 under the electric customer choice program an increase of 70 million over 2002 lost choice margins that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation are recorded as regulatory assets and therefore reduced depreciation and amortization expense as subsequently discussed gross margins benefited from a 64 per mwh 4 decline in fuel and purchased power costs reflecting the use of a more favorable power supply mix the favorable mix is due to lower purchases which is driven by lost sales under the electric customer choice program gross margins in 2002 improved 106 million due primarily to significantly lower fuel and purchased power costs partially offset by reduced operating revenues the reduction in fuel and purchased power costs was driven by a 3908 per mwh 50 reduction in average purchased power prices from 2001 levels the decline in operating revenues is attributable to commercial industrial and wholesale customers commercial and industrial revenues were lower due to a full year’s impact of a 5 legislatively mandated rate reduction for customers that began in april 2001 additionally revenues from these retail customers were affected by customers switching to alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program revenues from wholesale customers were reduced reflecting lower power prices partially offsetting these revenue reductions was the impact of weather resulting in a 10 increase in cooling demand during 2002 34   operation and maintenance expense increased 2 million in 2003 and 55 million in 2002 operation and maintenance expenses in 2003 were affected by 5 million in costs associated with the august 2003 blackout note 4 and a 69 million increase in employee pension and health care benefit costs due to recent financial market performance lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the dte operating system our companywide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies as well as enhance operating performance the dte operating system involves the application of tools and operating practices which have resulted in inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems among other enhancements operation and maintenance expenses in 2003 also benefited from 23 million in sales of emissions credits and lower employee incentive costs operation and maintenance expenses in 2002 reflect 18 million in higher employee pension and health care benefit costs and 43 million in expenses associated with maintaining our generation fleet the 2002 increase also includes a 5 million increase in allocations for corporate support services as well as 11 million to fund the low income and energy efficiency fund the funding of the low income and energy efficiency program was required under michigan legislation and is recovered in current sales rates depreciation and amortization expense decreased 107 million in 2003 and 54 million in 2002 the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the income effect of recording regulatory assets totaling 126 million in 2003 and 41 million in 2002 representing the deferral of net stranded and other costs we believe are recoverable under public act 141 the decline in 2002 also reflects the extension of the amortization period from seven years to 14 years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in 2001 see note 4 – regulatory matters partially offsetting these declines was increased depreciation associated with generationrelated capital expenditures other income and deductions declined 40 million in 2003 and increased 5 million in 2002 the reduction in 2003 is attributable to lower interest expense and increased interest income interest expense reflects lower borrowing levels and rates and interest income includes the accrual of carrying charges on environmentalrelated regulatory assets outlook – future operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings new legislation changes in market prices of power changes in economic conditions and the levels of customer participation in the electric customer choice program as previously discussed we expect to continue losing retail sales and margins in future years under the electric customer choice program until the inequities associated with this program are addressed we will accrue as regulatory assets our unrecovered generationrelated fixed costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation we have addressed the issue of stranded costs in our june 2003 electric rate filing and are also pursuing a legislative solution additionally we requested an increase in retail electric rates of 427 million annually to recover higher operating costs and the resumption of the pscr mechanism in february 2004 the mpsc authorized an interim base rate increase of 248 million annually the actual timing and level of recovering stranded and operating costs will ultimately be determined by the mpsc or legislation we cannot predict the outcome of these matters see note 4 – regulatory matters 35 energy services energy services is comprised of coalbased fuels onsite energy projects and merchant generation coalbased fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants both processes generate tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code onsite energy projects include pulverized coal injection power generation steam production chilled water production wastewater treatment and compressed air supply merchant generation owns and operates four gasfired peaking electric generating plants and develops and acquires gas and coalfired generation  factors impacting income  energy services earnings increased 17 million in 2003 and 67 million in 2002 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed these results primarily reflect increases in synfuel production varying levels of section 29 tax credits a onetime contract gain and a writeoff of an uncollectable account operating revenues increased 284 million in 2003 and 198 million in 2002 reflecting higher synfuel production due to a greater number of operating synfuel plants all nine of our synfuel plants were operational throughout 2003 whereas only five were operational throughout 2002 and only two in 2001 as discussed in note 13 the growth in synfuel revenues was tempered by our decision to reduce synfuel production by approximately onehalf in june 2003 also impacting the 2003 comparison was reduced generation revenue due to the settlement of a tolling contract at one of our generating facilities   36 operation and maintenance expense increased 258 million in 2003 and 308 million in 2002 reflecting costs associated with the higher levels of synfuel production operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses which are more than offset by the resulting section 29 tax credits operation and maintenance expense in 2003 also includes a 10 million net of tax writeoff for an uncollectable receivable associated with a large customer bankruptcy partially offsetting these increases was a onetime 19 million net of tax gain from the settlement of the tolling contract other income and deductions increased 16 million in 2003 and 87 million in 2002 the increases reflect our minority partners’ share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during 2002 and 2003 resulted in our minority partners being allocated a larger percentage of such losses income tax benefits decreased 19 million in 2003 and increased 95 million in 2002 income tax variations reflect changes in taxable earnings and the level of section 29 tax credits from our synfuel and coke battery facilities tax credits from our synfuel operations increased in each of the last two years due to higher synfuel production tax credits from our coke battery production reflect the expiration of such credits at two of our three plants in 2002 additionally tax credits were impacted by our interest in one of the coke battery projects being reduced from 95 to 5 in 2002 consistent with the original purchase and sale agreement outlook  a significant portion of energy services’ earnings consist of section 29 tax credits synfuelrelated tax credits expire in 2007 tax credits for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002 and the third expires in 2007 we are aggressively pursuing opportunities to sell interests in all of our synfuel plants in 2004 the level of tax credits generated in future periods will be affected by the timing and number of synfuel projects sold when we sell an interest in a synfuel facility we recognize the gain from such sale under the installment method of accounting gain recognition is dependent on the synfuel production qualifying for section 29 tax credits in substance we are receiving installment gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base there is a bill currently before the united states congress that includes provisions extending or reinstating tax credits for various types of energy facilities and processes including coke batteries antrim shale gas coal bed methane refined coal and landfill gas we are unable to predict the outcome of the legislative process energy services will continue leveraging its extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy business we continue to explore growth opportunities that will not require significant initial capital investment we are currently negotiating an onsite energy business arrangement with a major manufacturer in the midwest power prices over the past few years have been low due in part to the current excess capacity in the generation industry additionally the generation tolling agreement that was settled in 2003 was at above market rates as a result of these factors we expect lower revenues and earnings from our merchant generation business in 2004 energy marketing  trading energy marketing  trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading and coenergy dte energy trading focuses on physical power marketing and 37 structured transactions as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants coenergy focuses on physical gas marketing and the optimization of dte energy’s owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and gas storage capacity to this end both companies enter into derivative financial instruments as part of their strategies including forwards futures swaps and option contracts the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives factors impacting income  energy marketing  trading’s earnings increased 20 million in 2003 of which 18 million was attributable to dte energy trading and 2 million to coenergy earnings for 2002 decreased 19 million consisting of a 6 million improvement at dte energy trading which was more than offset by a 25 million reduction at coenergy dte energy trading’s earnings improvement in 2003 and 2002 was due mainly to margins associated with shortterm physical trading and origination activities the improvement was partially offset by reduced proprietary trading profits proprietary trading represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of capturing profits on forward price movements   coenergy’s earnings in 2003 and 2002 were driven by varying levels of operating costs and margins operating costs reflect the scaleback of certain retail gas marketing operations in 2002 as well as lower allocations for corporate support services in 2003 variations in margins reflect 1 the settling or monetizing of certain inthemoney derivative contracts in 2003 2 a change in the method of accounting for our gas in inventory in january 2003 and 3 volatility related to the accounting for our productionrelated gas supply contracts in 2001 we monetized certain inthemoney derivative contracts in 2003 while simultaneously entering into replacement atthemarket contracts with various counterparties the monetizations were completed in conjunction with implementing a series of initiatives to improve cash flow as well as our ability to fully 38 utilize section 29 tax credits note 13 the monetizations had the impact of reducing unrealized gains and increasing realized gains by approximately 136 million with no significant impact on earnings as previously discussed our derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method including those derivatives that hedge our price risk exposure associated with gas in inventory through december 2002 our physical gas in inventory was marked to the current spot price under fair value accounting rules accordingly mark to market accounting for derivatives coupled with fair value accounting for gas in inventory minimized earnings mismatches to comply with new accounting requirements resulting from the rescission of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9810 “accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities ” we changed to the average cost method for our gas inventories effective january 2003 note 2 as a result coenergy experienced earnings volatility as it recorded unrealized gains in 2002 and unrealized losses in 2001 from fair valuing its inventory whereas no such gains or losses were recorded in 2003 the comparability of coenergy’s results was also affected by using different market prices for fair valuing its derivatives and fair valuing its gas in inventory before the accounting change derivatives are marked to market against the forward curve whereas gas in inventory was marked to the current spot price the difference in accounting for derivatives and gas in storage resulted in earnings volatility in 2002 and 2001 when price changes in the spot month did not correspond with those in the forward market gas in storage in december 2002 was priced at a spot market rate of 510 mcf compared to 277 per mcf in december 2001 and a may 31 2001 acquisition date rate of 410 per mcf significantly smaller changes in forward prices occurred during these same periods as a result the marktomarket gains and losses on gas inventory were only partially offset by marktomarket losses and gains on the storagerelated derivatives coenergy receives gas produced from dte energy’s gas production operations which is used to meet its commitments under longterm contracts with cogeneration customers the gas produced does not qualify for marktomarket accounting coenergy recorded a gain in 2001 totaling approximately 50 million net of taxes primarily attributable to marking to market sales contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss from marking to market the productionrelated gas supply in december 2001 coenergy entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation customers  outlook – energy marketing  trading will seek to manage its business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and customtailored bundled services to largevolume end users and utilities this capacity coupled with the synergies from dte energy’s other businesses positions the segment to add value significant portions of the energy marketing  trading portfolio are economically hedged and include financial instruments gas inventory as well as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage assets these financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory pipelines and storage assets are not considered derivatives for accounting purposes as a result energy marketing  trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying nonderivative contracts and assets a significant portion of the earnings volatility in this segment is associated with the natural gas storage cycle which runs from june to march injections of gas into inventory takes place in the summer and gas is withdrawn in the winter dte energy’s policy is to hedge the price risk of all purchases for storage with sales in the “over the counter” and futures markets eliminating the price risk for the storage business as previously discussed current accounting rules do allow for the marking to market of forward sales but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim periods but even out by the end of the storage cycle 39 in february 2004 we terminated a longterm gas exchange agreement and modified our future purchase commitments under a related transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company effective march 31 2004 the agreements were at rates that were not reflective of current market conditions and had been fair valued under generally accepted accounting principles in 2002 the fair value of the transportation agreement was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a derivative as a result of ferc order 637 the fair value amounts were being amortized to income over the life of the related agreements representing a net liability of approximately 75 million as of december 31 2003 we are currently negotiating new agreements with the interstate pipeline company we will record an appropriate adjustment to the liability after all related agreements have been finalized nonregulated  other our other nonregulated businesses are comprised of our coal services and biomass units coal services provides fuel transportation and equipment management services we specialize in minimizing energy production costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers additionally we participate in coal trading and coaltopower tolling transactions as well as sales of excess emissions credits coal services has formed a subsidiary dte peptec inc that uses proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations biomass develops owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the us gas produced from these landfill sites qualifies for section 29 tax credits factors impacting income  earnings declined 9 million in 2003 and increased 1 million in 2002 the 2003 decline reflects reduced marketing and tolling income as well as an increase in operating costs associated with ramping up the dte peptec business our first waste coal facility in ohio became operational in late2003  1 dte energy’s portion of total tax credits generated outlook – we expect to continue to grow our coal services and biomass units we believe a substantial market exists for the use of dte peptec inc technology and plan to aggressively pursue expansion opportunities we expect to open 3 to 5 operating sites in 2004 biomass currently has 31 operating sites and other projects under development section 29 tax credits related to biomass operations expire in 2007 energy distribution power distribution power distribution operations include the electric distribution services of detroit edison power distribution distributes electricity generated and purchased by energy resources and alternative electric suppliers to detroit edison’s 21 million customers 40  factors impacting income  power distribution earnings decreased 94 million during 2003 and increased 14 million in 2002 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed these results primarily reflect changes in operating revenues and increased operation and maintenance expenses merger and restructuring charges associated with the 2001 mcn energy acquisition also impacted the comparability of results operating revenues declined 96 million in 2003 primarily due to mild summer weather and the impact of slower economic conditions affecting commercial and industrial sales operating revenues increased 87 million in 2002 reflecting higher residential sales attributable to greater cooling demand below are volumes associated with the regulated power distribution business  operation and maintenance expense increased 75 million in 2003 and 138 million in 2002 reflecting higher costs associated with weatherrelated power outages employee benefits uncollectable accounts receivables allocations for corporate support services and customer service initiatives to improve customer satisfaction restoration costs associated with three catastrophic storms in 2003 and the august 2003 blackout totaled 76 million we experienced an april ice storm resulting in more than 400000 customers losing power a july windstorm affecting over 190000 customers a november windstorm affecting 160000 customers and the august blackout affecting all 21 million of our customers this compares with 49 million in costs in 2002 related to two catastrophic storms as well as heatrelated maintenance expenses due to prolonged periods of above normal summer temperatures and the related stress placed on our distribution system employee pension and health care benefit costs increased 26 million in 2003 and 12 million in 2002 due to recent financial market performance lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates uncollectable accounts expense increased 17 million in 2003 and decreased 1 million in 2002 reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to current economic conditions additionally results for 41 2003 also reflect costs associated with customer service initiatives and a net of tax loss of 14 million on the sale of our nonstrategic steam heating business note 3 partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the dte operating system as previously discussed and lower employee incentive costs taxes other than income decreased 17 million in 2003 and 3 million in 2002 the decline in 2003 is due to lower michigan single business taxes reflecting reduced taxable earnings and lower property taxes outlook – operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as weather changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms economic conditions and prior billing issues have resulted in an increase in past due receivables we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results as a result we have organized a focused effort to address the credit and collection issues we experienced numerous catastrophic storms over the past few years the effect of the storms on annual earnings ranged up to 70 million and was partially offset by storm insurance we were unable to obtain storm insurance at economical rates in 2004 and as a result we do not anticipate having insurance coverage at levels that would significantly offset unplanned expenses from ice storms tornadoes or high winds that damage our distribution infrastructure as previously mentioned detroit edison filed a rate case in june 2003 to address future operating costs and other issues detroit edison received an interim order in this rate case in february 2004 see note 4 – regulatory matters nonregulated nonregulated energy distribution operations consist of dte energy technologies which markets and distributes distributed generation products provides application engineering and monitors and manages generation system operations factors impacting income  nonregulated losses decreased 1 million in 2003 and increased 6 million in 2002 the slight improvement in 2003 is due primarily to increased sales and cost reductions outlook – although installed capacity for dte energy technologies is increasing the growth in this business is below our expectations accordingly we have taken actions to reduce our expenses and streamline our operations including exiting from some nonstrategic business lines and activities dte energy technologies expects to continue participating in the emerging distributed generation market 42 energy gas gas distribution gas distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily provided by michcon our gas utility that purchases stores distributes and sells natural gas to 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers located throughout michigan   reflects the operations of michcon from the may 31 2001 acquisition date nm  not meaningful 

factors impacting income gas distribution’s earnings declined 37 million in 2003 and increased 104 million in 2002 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed results in 2003 primarily reflect a decline in gross margins and increased operation and maintenance expenses the significant improvement in 2002 reflects a full year of operations of michcon which was acquired in conjunction with the mcn energy merger in may 2001 in contrast to 2001 the 2002 results include the january through april period when demand for natural gas is at its highest merger and restructuring charges associated with the merger also impacted the comparability the proforma impact of the mcn energy acquisition on dte energy is discussed in note 3 – acquisitions and dispositions gross margins declined 6 million in 2003 reflecting a 265 million reserve for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to a march 2003 mpsc order in michcon’s 2002 gcr plan case note 4 the impact of the reserve was significantly offset by increased sales due to colder winter weather in early 2003 operation and maintenance expense increased 74 million in 2003 reflecting higher costs associated with employee benefits uncollectable accounts receivables allocations for corporate support services and customer service initiatives employee pension and health care benefit costs increased 47 million in 2003 and uncollectable accounts expense increased 17 million in 2003 reflecting economic conditions and higher gas prices partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the dte operating system as previously discussed and lower employee incentive costs income taxes in 2003 were impacted by lower earnings and favorably affected by an increase in the amortization of tax benefits previously deferred in accordance with mpsc regulations outlook – operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings weather and changes in economic conditions higher gas prices current economic conditions and prior billing issues have resulted in an increase in past due receivables we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results as previously discussed we are focused on addressing the credit and collection issues the mpsc issued several orders that continue the gas customer choice program on a permanent basis since michcon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on michcon’s earnings as of december 2003 approximately 129000 customers were participating in the gas customer choice program compared with approximately 190000 customers as of december 2002 as a result of the continued increase in operating costs michcon filed a rate case in september 2003 to increase rates by 194 million annually to address future operating costs and other issues see note 4 – regulatory matters 43 nonregulated nonregulated operations include the gas production business and the gas storage pipelines  processing business our gas production business produces gas from proven reserves in northern michigan and sells the gas to the energy marketing  trading segment gas storage pipelines  processing has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field as well as lease rights to another natural gas storage field the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy entities factors impacting income  earnings increased 3 million in 2003 and 15 million in 2002 the 2003 earnings improvement primarily reflects the gain from the sale of our 16 pipeline interest in the portland natural gas transmission system the 2002 results reflect a full year of operations of the our nonregulated gas businesses that were acquired in conjunction with the mcn energy acquisition in may 2001 outlook – we expect to further develop our gas production properties in northern michigan and our pipelines processing and storage assets to support other dte energy businesses in october 2003 we acquired an additional 15 interest in the vector pipeline bringing our total ownership interest to 40 the purchase of the additional interest in the vector pipeline complements our existing gas distribution and storage facilities in michigan additionally we expect to continue to invest in opportunities in the coal bed methane business to leverage our production coal and low cost operating capabilities corporate  other corporate  other includes the administrative and general expenses of various corporate support functions such as accounting legal and information technology as these functions essentially support the entire company they are allocated to the various segments based on services utilized and therefore can vary from year to year additionally corporate  other holds certain nonregulated debt and investments including assets held for sale and in emerging energy technologies factors impacting income  corporate  other’s losses were basically flat in 2003 and 2002 the 2003 results were affected by a 15 million cash contribution to the dte energy foundation that was funded with proceeds received from the sale of itc note 3 the impact of the contribution was offset by lower interest costs results in 2002 reflect higher interest expense resulting from increased debt and a full year’s impact of corporate debt assumed in the mcn energy acquisition additionally 2002 results reflect a reserve of 11 million pretax for the possible loss associated with direct loans to and the guarantee of debt of a technology investment losses in 2001 include the amortization of goodwill associated with the mcn energy acquisition discontinued operations  itc in december 2002 we entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of kohlberg kravis roberts  co and trimaran capital partners llc to sell itc for 610 million in cash the sale closed on february 28 2003 following approval of the transaction by the ferc and resolution of all other contingencies and generated a net of tax gain of 63 million prior to may 31 2001 detroit edison owned and operated the transmission assets of itc which were vertically integrated with its other operations accordingly revenues expenses and cash flows associated with these transmission assets were bundled with detroit edison’s power distribution operations significant changes in regulation over the past few years required detroit edison to cede operating control of its transmission assets to an independent system operator or to sell its transmission assets in response to these new requirements we formed itc and transferred our transmission assets to this whollyowned subsidiary with the intent of divesting itc effective june 1 2001 the transmission assets of itc were transferred to dte corporate and its revenues expenses and cash flows were separately monitored to measure its financial and operating performance accordingly the presentation of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations reflects the results of itc after may 31 2001 the 44 financial results of the transmission business prior to june 1 2001 are included as part of the power distribution segment cumulative effect of accounting changes as required by generally accepted accounting principles on january 1 2003 we adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy trading activities the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2003 earnings by 27 million additionally on january 1 2001 we adopted a new accounting rule for derivative instruments and the cumulative effect of adopting this new rule increased 2001 earnings by 3 million see note 2 for further discussion capital resources and liquidity  1 2001 includes 175 billion of securitization bonds and 135 billion of debt issued to acquire mcn energy 

45 operating activities we use cash derived from operating activities to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our nonregulated businesses in addition we use cash from operations to retire longterm debt and pay dividends a majority of the company’s operating cash flow is provided by the two regulated utilities which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather customer choice sales loss regulatory outcomes economic conditions and operating costs this part of our business has recently been under considerable financial pressure given that we have not had a rate increase in over 10 years coupled with higher operating costs and increased regulatory deferrals while these regulatory deferrals at detroit edison have served to mitigate some of the earnings pressures as a result of these influencing factors the corresponding cash flows have been deferred our nonregulated businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range of operating profiles these vary from our synthetic fuels business which will provide substantial cash flow over the next 5 years to new startups such as our coal bed methane or waste coal recovery businesses which are growing and will require modest investments beyond their cash generation capabilities during 2003 our consolidated net cash from operating activities was 950 million reflecting a decrease of 46 million from 2002 levels the decrease in 2003 operating cash flow was attributable to declines in regulated net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation depletion amortization deferred taxes and gains reflecting the impacts of weather lost electric customer choice margins and higher operating costs partially offsetting these declines were lower working capital and other requirements reflecting a companywide initiative focused on improving cash flow the initiative included better inventory management improved accounts receivable collections the selling of interests in our synfuel facilities the monetization of inthemoney derivatives and replacing margin deposits with letters of credit the improvement in working capital was achieved despite a 222 million contribution to our pension plan operating cash flow in 2002 of 996 million was 185 million higher than 2001 levels largely attributable to the full year’s impact of the mcn energy acquisition which was completed in may 2001 lower working capital and other requirements were partially offset by a decline in net income after adjusting for noncash items working capital reflects the seasonal requirements of the gas business where cash is used in the second half of the year to finance increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable additionally past due accounts receivable balances increased due to higher gas prices economic conditions and conversion issues with the new combined utility billing system outlook — we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the longterm but to remain relatively the same in 2004 as 2003 cash flow improvements from utility rate increases and synfuel sales will be offset by higher cash requirements primarily within our energy marketing and trading business operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in 2004 but will be affected by the level of sales migration under the electric customer choice program and the ability of the mpsc within the regulatory processes to put in place a choice program that has sound economic fundamentals in addition the choice program’s impact will also be determined by the success of the company in addressing certain structural flaws within the legislative process while the choice program’s shortfalls may be structurally addressed within these two processes the use of regulatory deferrals by the mpsc might affect the cash benefits of addressing the existing choice program being realized in 2004 another factor affecting regulated cash flows is the degree and timing of rate relief within the electric and gas rate cases based on the interim order issued by the mpsc on february 20 2004 approximately 71 million of additional revenues should be realized within the 2004 calendar year due to the structure of the interim rate order we will not realize the full benefits of interim and final rate relief until 2006 when customer rate caps expire improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better managing our working capital requirements including the continued focus of reducing past due accounts receivables our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be centered around cash generation and conservation given the regulatory uncertainties cash flow from our synfuel business including proceeds from the sale of interests in related facilities should shift from a net cash loss of 195 million in 2003 to positive cash flow of 135 million in 2004 and 355 million in 2005 the expected improvements are driven by the sale of interests in synfuel facilities increased production and a higher cash value per credit we will also benefit from lower taxes paid as we use our tax credit carry forward position our other operating nonregulated businesses will provide minimal cash from operations in 2004 and grow modestly in future years remaining startup businesses such as coal bed methane waste coal recovery and distributed generation will have cash losses over the next couple of years while they are being further developed certain of the cash initiatives previously discussed resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in 2003 which will have the impact of lowering cash flow in 2004 46 investing activities cash inflows associated with investing activities are partially generated from the sale of assets and utilized to invest in our utilities and nonregulated businesses in any given year we will look to harvest cash from under performing or nonstrategic assets capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations we have incurred higher utility capital expenditures over the past several years to comply with new air quality standards capital spending within our nonregulated businesses should be viewed in two categories for businesses currently operating expenditures are for ongoing maintenance and some expansion the balance of nonregulated spending is for growth which we manage very carefully we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy management skills risks and returns all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria for new business lines we invest tentatively based on research and analysis based on a limited investment we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results in any given year the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings during 2003 we had net cash from investing activities of 10 million compared to cash used of 11 billion in 2002 the significant improvement was due to proceeds totaling 758 million from the sale of itc interests in three synfuel projects and nonstrategic assets that were acquired as part of the mcn energy acquisition additionally regulated and nonregulated plant expenditures decreased significantly in 2003 lower regulated expenditures of 115 million were associated with air quality regulations that require reductions in nitrogen oxide levels nonregulated expenditures declined by 118 million and the comparison reflects costs incurred in 2002 associated with four synfuel facilities that became fully operational during 2002 the investing activity cash flow comparison improved by 12 billion and was impacted by the cash portion of the mcn energy acquisition in 2001 the 2002 improvement was also due to lower nonregulated capital expenditures partially offset by reduced proceeds from the sale of assets outlook — our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2004 ranging from 750 million to 10 billion our utilities plan to spend higher amounts of capital but actual spending levels will be matched to available cash flows until our two rate cases are resolved we will hold utility capital spending at 2003 levels capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2004 primarily as a result of our dte2 initiative as subsequently discussed this project will require capital investments in 2004 and 2005 for new computer systems nonregulated capital spending will approximate 80 million to 100 million annually for the next several years capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will be constrained in 2004 due to the pending rate cases electric customer choice issues and rating agency concerns about these businesses accordingly we are seeking to grow the business by making small investments in areas like coal bed methane and waste coal recovery utilizing this approach allows us to determine quarterly our spending levels which will be based on capital and credit constraints longer term once the electric choice issues are resolved and utility rate increases are fully phased in we anticipate capital availability to return to historical levels after the utilities return to financial health we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategy and financial and risk criteria we will look to make investments if we have the available cash flow and can’t find value creating investments we intend to return that capital to shareholders and pay down debt we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources both internal and external to balance anticipated capital requirements financing activities we continually evaluate our leverage targets to ensure that they are consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating since our merger with mcn energy in 2001 we have been successful in reducing our leverage given the present environment in our industry the increase in regulatory assets and the nature of the electric customer choice program and other uncertainties we may need to further lower our leverage in the future our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity we have completed a number of refinancings over the past several years with the effect of extending the average maturity of our longterm debt the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates which have lowered our debt costs variable rate debt is principally in the form of outstanding commercial paper additionally we have interest rate derivatives that effectively converts fixed rate debt to variable rate debt variable rate debt represents approximately 10 of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2003 47 our net cash related to financing activities decreased 10 billion in 2003 and decreased 17 billion in 2002 the 2003 change was due to higher redemptions of longterm debt and lower proceeds from issuances of new debt and common stock in 2002 proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock were used for the redemption of higher cost debt and to reduce shortterm borrowings the 2001 issuance of 175 billion of securitization bonds and the 2001 issuance of 135 billion of longterm debt to finance the acquisition of mcn energy impacts the comparison between 2002 and 2001 in 2001 proceeds from the issuance of securitization bonds and other detroit edison and michcon debt were used to repay higher priced debt and repurchase our common stock details of 2003 financing activities follows note 9  outlook — our goal is to maintain a healthy balance sheet we intend on maintaining a high investment grade credit rating and maintaining leverage in the 50 to 55 range excluding certain debt principally securitization debt we expect to contribute 170 million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of 2004 this contribution will modestly improve our leverage additionally we expect to continue the practice of issuing new dte energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan we believe this is a costeffective means of raising new equity debt maturing in 2004 totals approximately 500 million and we called 100 million of trust preferred linked securities in late 2003 in addition there are outstanding debt instruments that are likely to be economic to redeem and refund with new debt in 2004 the company expects to continue to take advantage of low historical longterm interest rates and issue new securities with a longer life than the securities maturing or called as of december 31 2003 dte energy detroit edison and michcon have effective shelf registrations with the sec that allow for the issuance of up to an additional 13 billion of debt and 850 million of equity securities we have authorization from the dte energy board to repurchase approximately 95 million shares of our common stock no shares have been repurchased under this authorization since early 2002 future repurchases are not presently contemplated and will depend upon future market conditions and the company’s financial condition in october 2003 dte energy detroit edison and michcon entered into separate revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 13 billion these facilities support our use of letters of credit and the issuance of commercial paper borrowing available under these revolving credit facilities totaled 12 billion as of december 31 2003 our revolving credit facilities contain customary covenants including the requirement to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than 65 to 1 and an “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” ebitda to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1 as of december 31 2003 our debt to total capitalization ratio as computed under the terms of the agreement was 50 to 1 and our ebitda to interest ratio was 36 to 1 we anticipate having the need and the ability to renew these credit facilities prior to their expiration at fair and reasonable market rates as determined at the time of negotiation additionally detroit edison has a 200 million shortterm financing agreement secured by customer accounts receivable of which 100 million was outstanding as of december 31 2003 the agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts receivable detroit edison is currently in compliance with these covenants for additional information see note 10 — shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions leases purchase obligations and other longterm obligations as of december 31 2003  credit ratings the uncertainty in michigan’s regulatory environment and the impact of the electric customer choice program has resulted in various independent credit rating agencies reviewing our credit rating an unfavorable change in our rating could restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various nonregulated subsidiaries in the event that our credit rating is downgraded two levels and would therefore be below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately 290 million at december 31 2003 additionally our trading business could be required to cease operations and our access to the shortterm commercial paper market would be restricted or eliminated while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade we cannot predict the outcome of current or future reviews the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating agencies all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities   48 critical accounting estimates there are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment such estimates relate to regulation risk management and trading activities section 29 tax credits goodwill pension and post retirement costs and the allowance for doubtful accounts regulation a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 71 “ accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation ” application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of our businesses if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no 71 on all our operations we estimate that the extraordinary loss would be as follows   management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment note 4 risk management and trading activities all derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended through december 2002 trading activities were accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9810 “ accounting for energy trading and risk management activities ” effective january 2003 trading activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 see note 2  new accounting pronouncements the offsetting entry to “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge accounting the fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each reporting period for changes using market sources such as  market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective transparent prices can be obtained unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this criterion 49 section 29 tax credits we have generated section 29 tax credits from our synfuel coke battery biomass and gas production operations all of our synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations all section 29 tax credits taken after 1997 are subject to audit by the irs and if we fail to prevail through the administrative and legal process there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section 29 tax credits four of our synfuel facilities are under audit by the irs for 2001 and are expected to be completed in 2004 our portion of tax credits generated was 241 million in 2003 as compared to 250 million in 2002 and 165 million in 2001 outside firms assist us in assuring we operate in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the law as well as calculating the value of tax credits goodwill certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations note 1 in accordance with sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in order to perform these impairment tests we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation techniques which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit these cash flow estimates involve judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings based on our 2003 goodwill impairment test we determined that no impairment existed as of december 31 2003 our goodwill totaled 21 billion pension and postretirement costs our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors including rates of return on plan assets the discount rate the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of 47 million in 2003 pension income of 9 million in 2002 and pension costs of 159 million in 2001 postretirement benefits costs for all plans was 118 million in 2003 70 million in 2002 and 104 million in 2001 pension and postretirement benefits cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 90 at december 31 2003 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated input from our consultants including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond markets our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 65 in equity markets 28 in fixed income markets and 7 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe that 90 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a threeyear period because of this method the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded we have unrecognized net losses due to the recent unfavorable performance of the financial markets as of december 31 2003 we had 7 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating 50 agency the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 675 at december 31 2002 to 625 at december 31 2003 due to recent financial market performance lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates we estimate that our 2004 pension costs will approximate 100 million compared to 54 million in 2003 and our 2004 postretirement benefit costs will approximate 135 million compared to 118 million in 2003 we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets by 10 would have increased our 2003 qualified pension costs by approximately 22 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by 10 would have increased our pension costs for 2003 by approximately 11 million lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by 10 would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2003 by approximately 16 million the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by declines in the financial markets in recent years the value of our plan assets decreased from 28 billion at december 31 2001 to 24 billion at december 31 2002 the value at december 31 2003 increased to 29 billion the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize at december 31 2002 an additional minimum pension liability of 855 million an intangible asset of 57 million and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders’ equity of 518 million net of tax as of december 31 2003 we recognized a decrease in minimum pension liability of 75 million a decrease in intangible assets of 13 million and a decrease in other comprehensive loss a component of shareholders’ equity of 647 million 421 million after tax the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements will increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the financial markets we made a 35 million cash contribution to the pension plan in 2002 and a 222 million cash contribution in 2003 we anticipate making an approximate 170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in the first quarter of 2004 we also contributed 33 million to the postretirement plans in 2002 we did not contribute to the postretirement plans in 2003 and made a 40 million contribution in january 2004 in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act was signed into law this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law we have not quantified the impact of the act if any on our plan allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers historical trends economic conditions age of receivables and other information with the implementation of a new integrated utility billing system in late 2001 we encountered billing issues as is typical with largescale system implementations while we have resolved the primary billing issues we may encounter difficulty in collecting past due receivables higher customer bills due to increased gas prices the lack of adequate levels of assistance for lowincome customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables as a result of these factors our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2002 and 2003 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates however failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 51 environmental matters protecting the environment as well as correcting past environmental damage continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators legislation and or rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including detroit edison the environmental protection agency epa and the michigan department of environmental quality have aggressive programs to cleanup contaminated property the epa ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us detroit edison has spent approximately 560 million through december 2003 and estimates that it will spend approximately 40 million in 2004 and incur up to an additional 12 billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements recovery of costs to be incurred through december 2004 is included in our june 2003 electric rate case in addition we maintain the option to securitize these costs after the completion of our current regulatory proceedings the epa has initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of the clean air act asserting that older coalfired power plants have been modified in ways that would require them to comply with the more restrictive “new source” provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison the united states district court for the southern district of ohio eastern division issued a decision in august 2003 finding ohio edison company in violation of the new source provisions of the clean air act if the court’s decision is upheld the electric utility industry could be required to invest substantial amounts in pollution control equipment during the same month however a district court in a different division rendered a conflicting decision on the matter on august 27 2003 the epa released new rules effective december 26 2003 allowing repair replacement or upgrade of production equipment without triggering source requirement controls if the cost of the parts and repairs do not exceed 20 of the replacement value of the equipment being upgraded such repairs will be considered routine maintenance however any changes in emissions would be subject to existing pollution permit limits and other state and federal programs for pollutants several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and on december 24 2003 were granted a stay until the us court of appeals dc circuit hears the arguments on the case we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison dte energy operating system and dte2 during 2002 we adopted the dte energy operating system which is a philosophy that involves the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems among other enhancements operation and maintenance expenses benefited from our companywide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies and enhance operating performance we expect continued cost containment efforts and process improvements in 2003 we began the implementation of dte2 a companywide initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems including finance human resources supply chain and work management we expect to incrementally spend approximately 150 million to 175 million over the next 3 to 4 years to implement these new processes and systems we expect the benefits to outweigh this investment primarily from lower costs faster business cycles repeatable and optimized processes enhanced internal controls improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs new accounting pronouncements see note 2– new accounting pronouncements for

three strategic business units energy resources energy distribution and energy gas the balance of our business consists of corporate  other based on this structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance each business unit has regulated and nonregulated operations and contributed to dte energy’s 2002 diluted earnings per share of 383 see note 19 — segment and related information for financial information by segment for the last three years a discussion of each business follows energy resources power generation description power generation comprises our regulated power generation business and plants within detroit edison these plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies including the mpsc nrc and the epa electricity is generated from detroit edison’s numerous fossil plants its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant and then sold principally throughout michigan the midwest and ontario canada the electricity we produce is sold to four major classes of customers residential commercial industrial and wholesale weather economic factors and electricity prices affect sales to customers our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and coolingrelated demands during 2002 sales to automotive and automotiverelated customers accounted for approximately 13 of total power generation operating revenues power generation sales are not dependent upon a limited number of customers the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on power generation 5 our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with market purchases the table below details our energy supply mix and average cost per unit   we expect an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers we have short and longterm supply contracts for expected fuel and purchased power requirements as detailed in the following table  detroit edison’s generating capability is heavily dependent upon coal the coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms detroit edison expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through longterm and mediumterm contracts with the balance to be obtained through shortterm agreements and spot purchases detroit edison has contracts with eight coal suppliers for a total purchase of up to 296 million tons of lowsulfur western coal to be delivered from 2003 through 2006 detroit edison also has contracts with three suppliers for the purchase of approximately 40 million tons of appalachian coal to be delivered from 2003 through 2005 these existing longterm coal contracts include provisions for price escalation as well as deescalation given the geographic diversity of supply detroit edison believes it can meet the expected generation requirements we have longterm transportation contracts with companies to provide rail car and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities we purchase power from other electricity generators suppliers and wholesalers these purchases supplement our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles for example when high temperatures occur during the summer we require additional electricity to meet demand this access to additional power is an efficient and economical way to meet our obligation to customers without increasing capital expenditures to build additional baseload power facilities 6 regulation detroit edison’s power generation business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc the mpsc issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters detroit edison’s mpscapproved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs plus an authorized rate of return on our investments the ferc regulates detroit edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities the nrc has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation construction licensing and decommissioning of detroit edison’s fermi 2 nuclear plant since 1996 there have been several important acts orders court rulings and legislative actions in the state of michigan which affect our power generation operations in 1996 the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s electric customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower electric generation costs resulting from competition in 1998 the mpsc authorized the electric customer choice program that allowed for a limited number of customers to purchase electricity from suppliers other than their local utility the local utility would continue to transport the electric supply to the customers’ facilities thereby retaining distribution margins the electric customer choice program was phased in over a threeyear period with all customers having the option to choose their electric supplier by january 2002 in 2000 the michigan legislature enacted legislation that reduced electric rates by 5 and reaffirmed january 2002 as the date for full implementation of the electric customer choice program this legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing rate increases for residential customers through 2005 and for small business customers through 2004 the legislation and an mpsc order issued in 2001 established a methodology to enable detroit edison to recover costs related to its generation operations stranded costs that may not otherwise be recoverable due to electric customer choice related lost sales and margins the legislation also provides for the recovery of the costs associated with the implementation of electric customer choice the mpsc has determined that these costs be treated as regulatory assets additionally the legislation provides for recovery of costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes laws and other governmental actions including the clean air act due to mpsc orders issued in 1997 and 1998 that altered the regulatory process in michigan and provided a plan for transition to competition for the generation business of detroit edison effective december 1998 detroit edison’s generation business no longer met the criteria of sfas no 71 “ accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation ” since the june 2000 legislation was enacted into law and with the issuance of subsequent clarifying mpsc orders in 2001 and 2002 rates for retail customers and transition charges for electric customer choice customers will be set to recover detroit edison’s generation costs such costs will be billed and recovered from both retail and choice customers and thus satisfy the criteria of sfas no 71 in addition we have the legislative authority to defer regulatory costs in 2002 and 2003 and to begin recovery of such costs starting in 2004 after the mandated rate freeze expires as a result we resumed application of sfas no 71 for our generation business in the fourth quarter of 2002 in november 2002 the mpsc requested michigan gas and electric utilities to justify why their retail rates should not be lowered due to potential personal property tax reductions we have responded and await further mpsc action for additional information regarding our regulatory environment see note 6 — regulatory matters 7 properties detroit edison owns generating properties and facilities that are all located in the state of michigan substantially all the net utility properties of detroit edison are subject to the lien of its mortgage power generation plants owned and in service as of december 31 2002 are as follows   strategy and competition our strategy for power generation is to build upon detroit edison’s solid reputation we will continue to strive to be the preferred electricity supplier in southeast michigan we believe that we can accomplish our goal by working with our customers and communities to be a reliable supplier of electricity to control expenses we plan to optimize our fuel blends and make investments in our generating plants that will reduce unplanned plant outages and improve operating efficiencies thereby increasing generation output without proportional additional fuel requirements revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions economic factors regulatory events and other risk factors as discussed in the “risk factors” section that follows alternative suppliers of generation services in the retail and wholesale markets create competition in the electric generating business effective january 1 2002 the electric customer choice program expanded in michigan whereby all electric customers can choose to purchase their electricity from alternative suppliers approximately 6 of detroit edison’s retail generation sales were lost in 2002 as a result of 8 customers participating in the electric customer choice program we expect to lose between 10 to 13 of retail sales in 2003 as a result of customers choosing to participate in the program energy services description nonregulated energy services has three business lines coalbased fuels onsite energy projects and merchant generation coalbased fuels coalbased fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants both processes generate tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code section 29 is designed to stimulate investment in and development of alternate fuel sources synfuelrelated section 29 tax credits expire in 2007 section 29 tax credits for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002 with the third expiring in 2007 the synthetic fuel process involves chemically modifying and binding particles of coal to produce a fuel that is used for power generation and coke production the modification involves a threestep process that produces a solid synthetic fuel product that has characteristics similar to those of highquality mined coal the potential benefits of this process can include increased use of lower quality coal improved coking qualities of the coal reduced dust and air emissions and improved material handling during 2002 we sold a 95 interest in two of our synfuel projects the coke battery facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within the steel industry dte energy is one of the largest producers in the us of coke for the steel industry during 2001 we sold a 49 interest in two of our coke battery projects and in 2002 consistent with the original purchase and sale agreement our third coke battery project interest was reduced from 95 to 5   onsite energy projects energy services owns and operates onsite facilities including pulverized coal injection power generation steam production chilled water wastewater treatment and compressed air many of these facilities deliver utility services to industrial commercial and institutional customers merchant generation energy services develops and operates peaking and gasfired electric generating plants we have four electric generating plants in operation all located in the great lakes region we have contracts for approximately 39 of the 2003 output of these plants 9 properties coalbased fuels owns interest in and operates nine synfuel plants at eight production sites additionally we have interests in three coke battery facilities in the united states two of which we operate coal based fuels  onsite energy projects owns andor operates energy facilities throughout the united states the significant properties are varied in both use and function and are listed below onsite energy projects  the merchant generation fleet consists of four natural gasfired electric generating plants that are all located in the great lakes region merchant generation  10 strategy and competition our strategy for energy services is to continue leveraging our extensive energyrelated operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy and merchant generating businesses we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell interests in some or all of our synfuel plants we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate in determining which markets to compete in we examine closely the regulatory environment the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our interrelated businesses as we expand from our current regional focus as we pursue growth opportunities our first priority will be to achieve valueadded returns and then trend towards increased operational scale we plan to focus on the following areas for growth  energy marketing  trading description energy marketing  trading consists of the wholesale electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading company and coenergy trading company we acquired coenergy trading as part of the mcn energy acquisition in may 2001 energy marketing  trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions for large customers as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy’s power plants pipeline and storage assets in pursuing these goal s energy marketing  trading may enter into forwards futures swaps and option contracts regulation there have been numerous events that impacted the energy trading business these events led to increased oversight and scrutiny of the trading business by state and federal regulatory agencies strategy and competition our strategy for energy marketing  trading is to execute on our vision of the role energy trading plays in delivering valueadded services to our customers over the past year many of the major market players have either ceased as going concerns or are no longer engaged in the energy trading business we seek to gradually expand this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments we plan to focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy assets we have risk management and credit policies to monitor and minimize risk 11 coal services description coal services specializes in minimizing energy production costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive customers we provide fuel transportation and equipment management services tailored to the individual requirements of each customer our customers include electric utilities merchant producers integrated steel mills and large industrial producers with high energy requirements we also operate a number of railcar maintenance and repair facilities serving coal transporters as well as all other industries and rail car types  properties we lease approximately 2800 rail cars we own fixed and mobile railcar maintenance and repair facilities in nebraska and indiana strategy and competition we plan to leverage our position as one of the top north american coal marketers and our reputation as an efficient manager of transportation assets certain trends are taking place within our industry that could have an impact on how we compete in the future industry consolidation in the mining business is resulting in fewer but larger mines consolidation in the railroad industry is reducing the number of rail companies we can contract with to transport coal for our customers we plan to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to the energy requirements for our customers we are also exploring a technology that removes clay and dirt from waste coal if the technology is commercially practical it could contribute significantly to earnings and provide environmental benefits biomass description biomass develops owns and operates landfill gas recovery systems in the us landfill gas a byproduct of solid waste decomposition is composed of approximately equal portions of methane and carbon dioxide converting the methane into a renewable energy resource conserves fossil fuels biomass operations generate section 29 tax credits that expire in 2007 biomass helps limit potential greenhouse gas emissions by developing and implementing landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and use it productively such a recovery system eliminates detrimental air emissions by preventing methane from migrating offsite and becoming a safety hazard or odor problem landfill gas recovery systems also provide local utilities industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive renewable source of energy applications for this form of energy include steam and electricity generation fueling of asphalt plants and kilns for brick manufacturing 12   properties biomass has 30 operating sites and other projects are under development these sites are located throughout the continental us strategy and competition biomass’ strategy capitalizes upon our industry experience of over 20 years we are evaluating business growth through both development and acquisitions we compete primarily with fossil fuels like natural gas but we believe the environmental benefits of biomass along with reasonable and economic access to these landfill sites provide a platform for future growth energy distribution power distribution  transmission description the electric distribution services and the steam heating business of detroit edison and the electric transmission services of itc comprise our regulated power distribution  transmission business this business transmits and distributes electricity generated by energy resources’ power generation business and alternative electric suppliers to detroit edison’s 21 million customers in southeastern michigan the transmission assets of itc are operated by the midwest independent system operator a regional transmission operator responsible for evaluating and coordinating requests for transmission service on a nondiscriminatory basis in the fourth quarter of 2002 we entered into an agreement with kohlberg kravis roberts and company and trimaran capital partners llc to sell itc for 610 million the sale closed on february 28 2003 in january 2003 we sold the steam heating business to thermal ventures ii lp weather and economic factors affect our sales and revenues similar to the power generation business our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and coolingrelated demands power distribution  transmission’s sales are not dependent upon a limited number of customers additionally customers participating in the electric customer choice program will not impact power distribution  transmission’s operating revenues or the number of customers served the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on power distribution  transmission  13 regulation detroit edison’s power distribution is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc itc’s transmission business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the ferc the mpsc and ferc have regulatory jurisdiction over rates conditions of service and other operatingrelated matters as previously discussed michigan legislation prevents detroit edison from increasing rates to residential customers through 2005 for small business customers through 2004 and remaining customers through 2003 we expect the rates charged by itc to remain at current levels through december 2004 for additional information regarding our regulatory environment see note 6 — regulatory matters properties detroit edison owns and operates 662 distribution substations with a capacity of 30843000 kilovolt amperes kv and 406176 line transformers with a capacity of 24493806 kv amperes substantially all of the net

ontario hydro services company in addition detroit edison has interchange agreements for the exchange of electric energy with michigan south central power agency and the city of wyandotte 14 strategy and competition our strategy is to build upon detroit edison’s solid reputation of being a reliable distributor of electricity we plan to focus on improving the quality of customer service and lowering operating costs by improving operating efficiencies as well as targeting capital investments in areas that have the greatest impact on reliability improvements with the goal of managing distribution rates charged to utility customers the decision to sell itc is consistent with our strategic view that maximization of shareholder value and high levels of customer service are best achieved with assets we own operate and exercise significant control the sale was completed on february 28 2003 and itc will continue to provide transmission services to the energy distribution business as detroit edison’s rates were designed to recover transmission costs billings to detroit edison from itc will be recovered from detroit edison’s utility customers rates charged by itc to detroit edison are expected to remain at current levels through december 2004 thereafter rates would be subject to normal ferc regulation and market forces competition in the regulated electrical distribution business is provided primarily by onsite generation by industrial customers and distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers we do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers distributed generation description distributed generation primarily consisting of dte energy technologies dtech invests in emerging technologies that complement our existing businesses we currently have businesses that develop market and distribute a broad portfolio of distributed generation products provide application engineering and monitor and manage system operations distributed generation units seek to generate safe clean reliable power at or near the point of use rather than at large central power stations which can provide very high efficiencies due to effective use of waste heat distributed generation products use a range of technologies including internal combustion engines external combustion engines miniturbines and fuel cells distribution generation has steadily increased the number of completed projects each year the table below details the number of projects completed in the past three years  15 strategy and competition our goal is to become a significant player in the distributed generation market providing onestop shopping that meets customers’ total energy needs key milestones toward this success include full commercialization of our internal combustion enginedriven products as well as our monitoring and system management operations additionally we are completing the development of our first turbinepowered product our north american sales structure is in place and we are continuing to expand our support capabilities both direct and with partners important objectives beyond north america will be the continued development of marketing relationships in europe korea and japan competition in the distributed generation business currently is provided by other distributors of standby generators we compete on the basis of cost and seek to better meet customer needs with our enhanced offerings including turnkey installations project management after sale service and system management operation we anticipate increased future competition including the entry of new competitors for continuous duty products and services to compete effectively we develop proprietary products and services that are sold through our existing distribution channels in north america and exclusive arrangements in international markets energy gas gas distribution description gas distribution operations primarily consist of michcon our regulated gas utility gas distribution provides gas sales and transportation delivery services to 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers located throughout michigan the following table details sales and deliveries to these customers   gas distribution makes gas sales primarily to residential and smallvolume commercial and industrial customers it provides end user transportation to largevolume commercial and industrial customers and gas customer choice customers who purchase natural gas directly from other suppliers and utilizes michcon’s pipeline network to transport the gas to the customer’s facilities gas distribution provides intermediate transportation to producers brokers and other gas companies that own the natural gas transported but are not the ultimate consumers michcon’s revenues and net income are impacted by weather and are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the year due to heatingrelated demand michcon’s operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on michcon 16 we obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms  supply under contract represents approximately 89 of the expected 157 bcf of supply requirements in 2003 we expect to meet the balance of gas supply requirements through open market purchases as a result of varying demand primarily due to weather michcon may use existing gas in inventory to meet unanticipated customer obligations given the geographic diversity of supply coupled with its 124 bcf of storage capacity michcon believes it can meet the supply requirements for customers michcon has longterm firm transportation agreements expiring on various dates through 2011 for delivery of purchased natural gas to our distribution system regulation michcon is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mpsc which issues orders pertaining to rates recovery of certain costs including the costs of regulatory assets conditions of service accounting and operatingrelated matters michcon is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety the environment and health in the late 1990s the mpsc began an initiative designed to give all of michigan’s natural gas customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower gas costs resulting from competition in 1999 the mpsc approved a comprehensive experimental threeyear gas customer choice program that allowed an increasing number of customers to purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility the local utility would continue to transport the natural gas supply to the customers’ facilities thereby retaining distribution margins in december 2001 the mpsc issued an order that continues the gas customer choice program on a permanent and expanding basis beginning with the conclusion of the threeyear temporary program on march 31 2002 under the expanded program beginning april 1 2002 up to approximately 40 of customers could elect to purchase gas from suppliers other than michcon beginning in april 2003 up to approximately 60 of customers could participate and beginning april 2004 all 12 million of michcon’s gas customers could choose to participate michcon will continue to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customers’ premises at prices that generate favorable margins under the december 2001 mpsc order michcon returned to a gas cost recovery gcr mechanism in january 2002 upon termination of its temporary gas sales program the gcr permits michcon to pass the cost of natural gas to its customers under the gas sales program the mpsc suspended the gcr mechanism and michcon’s sales rates included a gas commodity component that was fixed at 295 per thousand cubic feet mcf under this program michcon incurred commodity price risk associated with its ability to secure gas supplies at prices less than 295 per mcf beginning in january 2002 michcon’s gas sales rates include a gas commodity component designed to recover its actual gas costs for additional information regarding our regulatory environment see note 6 — regulatory matters 17 properties michcon owns distribution transmission and storage properties and facilities that are all located in the state of michigan at december 31 2002 michcon’s distribution system included 17774 miles of distribution mains 1136863 service lines and 1241516 active meters michcon owns 2581 miles of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect its storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas michcon owns properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 124 bcf substantially all of the net utility properties of michcon are subject to the lien of its mortgage strategy and competition the strategy of the gas distribution business is to expand our role as the preferred provider of natural gas and highvalue energy services within michigan we expect modest growth and to control costs in order to provide customers highquality service at competitive prices competition in the gas business primarily involves alternate fuels and energy sources natural gas continues to be the preferred space and waterheating fuel developers select natural gas in new construction because of the convenience cleanliness and relative price advantage compared to propane fuel oil and other alternative fuels exploration  production description the exploration  production ep business owns one of the industry’s largest antrim gas reserve bases our emphasis is on developing and producing the 400 bcf of proved reserves we owned as of december 31 2002 predominantly located in northern michigan we drilled 90 wells 78 net of interest of others in 2002 wells drilled in the antrim shale formations have high success rates and low drilling costs and are therefore considered low risk properties the michigan properties had 242 bcf equivalents of production in 2002 ep does not anticipate adding a significant amount of new reserves to its 400 bcf of proven reserves at december 31 2002 strategy the ep business is aggressively managing its michigan oil and gas producing assets to optimize returns on investment we have operator responsibilities for our michigan properties with the goal of lowering the costs of producing reserves ep has rights to 86050 acres 69977 net of interest of others of undeveloped leases during 2003 ep plans to continue developing this acreage and anticipates selling nearly all of its gas production to dte energy’s energy marketing  trading segment in addition in order to leverage our ep capabilities and the skills and experience of other nonregulated businesses we are exploring opportunities in the coal bed methane gas production business pipelines  processing description the pipelines  processing business has partnership interests in two interstate transmission pipelines portland natural gas transmission system portland and vector pipeline vector seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a 97 bcf natural gas storage field additionally we have contract rights to a 425 bcf natural gas storage field the assets of the pipelines  processing business are primarily supported by the energy marketing  trading segment 18 properties  strategy and competition pipelines  processing focuses on opportunities in the midwesttonortheast region that supply natural gas to meet growing demand we expect much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the united states to occur within the midatlantic and new england regions these regions currently lack the pipeline capacity and lowcost storage necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet growing demand portland and vector are interstate pipeline projects that are intended to fill a large portion of that need and are complemented by energy gas’ significant storage capacity pipelines  processing has interests in seven processing plants that extract carbon dioxide from antrim gas production making it suitable for transportation to nearby markets additionally we have contract rights in natural gas storage fields capable of storing up to 522 bcf we plan to continue identifying asset opportunities related to natural gas storage and transmission and working with other dte energy affiliates to secure the market required to support asset investment corporate  other description corporate  other includes administrative and general expenses and interest costs that have not been allocated to regulated and nonregulated businesses corporate  other also includes various other nonregulated investments including assets held for sale and in emerging energy technologies strategy and competition our energy technology strategy is to invest in a profitable portfolio of energy technology companies that facilitate the creation of new businesses and expand growth opportunities for existing dte energy businesses we seek to gain early experience in emerging energy sectors where energy trends and technologies may create potentially profitable opportunities the investment portfolio consists of direct investments in energy technology companies and venture funds our largest investment is in plug power inc a company that designs and develops onsite electric fuel cell power generation systems in 2002 we invested 9 million in five emerging energy companies and 2 million in three energy technology venture funds 19 environmental matters we are subject to extensive environmental regulation additional costs may result as the effects of various chemicals on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers greater details on environmental issues are provided in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements  detroit edison detroit edison is subject to applicable permit requirements and to potentially increasing stringent federal state and local standards covering among other things particulate and gaseous stack emission limitations the discharge of waste into lakes and streams and the handling and disposal of waste material the us environmental protection agency epa issued ozone transport regulations and air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution the new rules have led to additional controls on fossilfueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and particulate emissions to comply with these new controls detroit edison has spent approximately 460 million through december 2002 and estimates that it will incur an additional 300 to 400 million of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy these new control requirements the epa initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison detroit edison is required to demonstrate that the cooling water intake structures at all of its facilities minimize adverse environmental impact detroit edison filed such demonstrations and in the event of a final adverse decision may be required to install additional control technologies to further minimize the impact various state and federal laws regulate detroit edison’s handling storage and disposal of its waste materials the epa and the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property detroit edison has extensive land holdings and from time to time must investigate claims of improperly disposed contaminants detroit edison anticipates it will be periodically included in these types of environmental proceedings michcon and citizens prior to the construction of major natural gas pipelines gas for heating and other uses was manufactured from processes involving coal coke or oil enterprises michcon and citizens a wholly owned utility located in adrian michigan owns or previously owned 17 such former manufactured gas plant mgp sites investigations have revealed contamination related to the byproducts of gas manufacturing at each site enterprises is remediating eight of the former mgp sites and is conducting more extensive investigations at three of the sites enterprises has received mdeq closure of one site and a determination that it is not a responsible party for two other sites while we cannot make any assurances we believe that a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the mpsc will prevent these costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations other our nonregulated affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants we believe these nonregulated affiliates are in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements 20 risk factors there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energy’s regulated and nonregulated businesses to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors others could emerge in the future each of the following risks could affect our performance weather — weather significantly affects our operations deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets lowering income and cash flow damage due to ice storms tornadoes or high winds can damage our infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses regional and national economic conditions — our businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve should national or regional economic conditions decline reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will result in decreased earnings and cash flow environmental laws and liability — we are subject to numerous environmental regulations these regulations govern air emissions water quality wastewater discharge solid waste and hazardous waste compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending operating expenses and plant down times these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses permits inspections and other regulatory approvals we may also incur liabilities because of our emission of gases that may cause changes in the climate including issues related to global warming the regulatory environment is subject to significant change and therefore we cannot predict future issues additionally we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties operation of nuclear facilities — ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects detroit edison to significant additional risks these risks among others include plant security environmental regulation and remediation and operational factors than can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility section 29 tax credits — we have generated section 29 tax credits from our synfuel coke battery and biomass operations generating section 29 tax credits is important to minimizing our income tax expense we have received favorable private letter rulings on 7 of our 9 synfuel plants and expect the remaining two in 2003 the generation of tax credits is subject to review by the internal revenue service if we failed to prevail through the administrative and legal process there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously taken section 29 tax credits which could impact our earnings and cash flows the value of future credits generated may be affected by new tax legislation the combination of overall industry audits of section 29 credits supply and demand for tax credits and new tax legislation could hinder our plan to sell interests in tax credit properties which could have an impact on our earnings and cash flows rate regulation — we operate in a regulated industry our rates are set by the mpsc and cannot be increased without their authorization we may be impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates impact our ability to recover costs through rate increases or may require us to incur additional expenses 21 competition — deregulation and restructuring in the electric and gas industry including customer choice programs could result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could affect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of our regulated businesses supply and price of raw materials — we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity price fluctuation and supply disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate electricity our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our regulated gas customers we have hedging policies in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices labor relations — unions represent a majority of our employees a union choosing to strike as a negotiating tactic could have an impact on our business unplanned outages — unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations this occurrence could result in spot market purchases of electricity in excess of our costs of generation access to capital markets and interest rates — our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses heightened concerns about the energy industry the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs upstream cash flows from subsidiaries — cash flows from subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy our ability to pay dividends and interest would be restricted property tax reform — we are one of the largest payers of property taxes in the state of michigan should the legislature change how schools are financed we could face increased property taxes on our michigan facilities credit ratings — increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating a change in our rating could restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs property insurance — while we seek to adequately insure our property catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god terrorism war or a combination of significant unforeseen items occurring at one time could impact our operations and economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance terrorism — damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets by terrorist groups would impact our operations at fermi 2 we have already increased security as a result of an nrc order and further security increases are expected additionally we may assist other energy companies if terrorists were to strike their energy facilities energy trading markets — recent events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole a decline in the confidence in the energy trading market along with stricter credit requirements has led to a decrease in the number of trading entities resulting in decreased liquidity in the energy trading

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations diluted earnings per share increased — our earnings in 2002 were 632 million or 383 per diluted share compared to earnings of 332 million or 216 per diluted share in 2001 the comparability of earnings was affected by merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization associated with the mcn energy merger that reduced 2001 aftertax earnings by 204 million or 132 per diluted share excluding merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization operating earnings increased 96 million or 35 per diluted share in 2002 compared to 2001 the increase was due to improved margins in our regulated energy resources business a full year of contributions from our energy gas business that was acquired in may 2001 in conjunction with the mcn energy acquisition and increased contribution from our nonregulated businesses primarily synfuels partially offsetting these improvements were higher operation and maintenance expenses and interest expense the issuance of 29 million shares of dte energy common stock in conjunction with the may 2001 mcn energy acquisition net of 105 million shares repurchased in 2001 and the issuance of 6325 million shares in june 2002 also impacted the earnings per share comparison earnings in 2001 decreased 136 million or 111 per diluted share from 2000 as previously discussed the earnings decline was due to significant merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization recorded in 2001 additionally merger and restructuring charges were recorded in 2000 reducing income by 16 million or 12 per diluted share excluding merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization earnings increased 52 million or 09 per diluted share in 2001 compared to 2000 the improvement in earnings primarily reflects contributions from our energy gas business and from our nonregulated businesses partially offsetting these improvements were increased interest on longterm debt and lower margins from regulated electricity operations strategic direction — we are committed to increasing our annual earnings at a 6 average rate our growth strategy is to strengthen the core electric and gas utilities add to our portfolio of nonregulated businesses and leverage investments in energy technology nonregulated growth is expected to shift over the next few years from profits from tax advantaged coalbased fuels businesses that generate section 29 tax credits to growth from energy technologies onsite energy projects generation projects energy trading coal services waste coal recovery and coal bed methane we operate our businesses through three strategic business units energy resources energy distribution and energy gas each business unit has regulated and nonregulated operations the balance of our business consists of corporate  other based on this structure we set strategic goals allocate resources and evaluate performance 27   energy resources power generation the power generation plants of detroit edison comprise our regulated power generation business electricity is generated from detroit edison’s numerous fossil plants its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant and sold principally throughout michigan and the midwest to residential commercial industrial and wholesale customers factors impacting income power generation earnings increased 58 million in 2002 and decreased 69 million in 2001 compared to the prior year as subsequently discussed these results reflect changes in gross margins increased operation and maintenance expenses lower depreciation and amortization expenses and reduced property taxes 28   gross margins in 2002 improved 106 million due primarily to significantly lower purchased power costs partially offset by reduced operating revenues average purchased power cost per unit in 2002 declined 3908 per megawatthour mwh from 2001 levels the decline in revenues was due to a full year impact of a 5 legislatively mandated rate reduction for commercial and industrial customers that began in april 2001 revenues from wholesale customers were reduced reflecting lower power prices revenues from retail customers were affected by customers switching to alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program note 6 partially offsetting these revenue reductions was the impact of weather resulting in a 10 increase in cooling demand during 2002 gross margins in 2001 declined by 112 million reflecting lower operating revenues slightly offset by lower fuel and purchased power costs the reduced operating revenues were due to the impact of an economic recession the electric customer choice program and securitization sales rates for commercial and industrial customers were lowered by the 5 rate reduction in april 2001 commercial and industrial sales decreased due to increased participation of customers in the electric customer choice program industrial sales also reflect reduced auto and steel production and the end of a special energy sales agreement with a large steel manufacturer in march of 2001 partially offsetting these declines were increased revenues from residential and wholesale customers as well as higher revenues from providing other energy related services residential customer revenues reflect higher demand resulting from weather partially offset by the impact of a 5 rate reduction that began in june 2000 revenues from wholesale customers increased due to gains from settling forward sales contracts the sales contracts were entered into to effectively close forward purchase contracts that hedged power supply costs accordingly the gains from forward sales contracts were substantially offset by losses from forward purchase contracts which are recorded as part of fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs were also affected by lower system output resulting from reduced electric sales as well as the result of using a more favorable power supply mix the supply mix reflects an increased usage of lowercost power from our generating plants and reduced usage of highercost purchased power 29   operation and maintenance expense increased 55 million in 2002 and 79 million in 2001 expense in both periods reflect an increase in planned and unplanned maintenance and reliability work for our power generation facilities which reduces random outages at power plants and our reliance on purchased power additionally both periods include higher employee pension and health care benefit costs costs allocated from dte energy corporate for corporate support services as well as the cost of funding the low income and energy efficiency fund the funding of the low income and energy efficiency program was required under michigan legislation and is recovered in current sales rates depreciation and amortization expense decreased 54 million in 2002 and 83 million in 2001 the declines reflect the extension of the amortization period from seven years to 14 years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in 2001 see note 6 — regulatory matters taxes other than income increased 8 million in 2002 and decreased 28 million in 2001 the 2001 decrease was due to lower property taxes resulting from new valuation tables approved by the michigan state tax commission stc several local taxing jurisdictions have taken legal action against the state of michigan to prevent the stc from implementing the new valuation tables see note 16 — commitments and contingencies outlook — electric restructuring is expected to continue to result in increased customer choice in the retail electric generation business effective january 1 2002 the electric customer choice program in michigan was expanded to allow all electric customers to purchase their electricity from suppliers other than their local utility as a result of customers choosing to participate in the electric customer choice program detroit edison lost 6 of retail sales in 2002 and estimates losing 10 to 13 of such sales in 2003 if detroit edison is unable to recover its fixed costs from retail customers due to lost sales under electric customer choice stranded costs michigan law allows for the recovery of all such amounts from electric customer choice customers detroit edison recorded a 21 million regulatory asset in 2002 representing stranded costs and other recoverable costs under michigan legislation the regulatory asset was calculated based on a refinement to the methodology approved by the michigan public service commission mpsc the regulatory asset will be subject to review in future regulatory proceedings and we cannot predict the outcome of this matter see note 6 — regulatory matters operating results are expected to vary as a result of various external factors such as weather changes in economic conditions and the level of customer participation in the electric customer choice program 30 energy services energy services is comprised of coalbased fuels onsite energy projects and merchant generation coalbased fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants both processes generate tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code onsite energy projects include pulverized coal power generation steam production chilled water wastewater treatment and compressed air merchant generation owns and operates four gasfired peaking electric generating plants and develops and acquires gas and coalfired generation  factors impacting income earnings increased 67 million in 2002 and 15 million in 2001 both periods reflect an increase in synfuel production partially offset by a reduction in coke battery ownership four new synfuel production facilities became operational in 2002 compared to three new facilities in 2001 we sold a 95 interest in two of our synfuel projects during 2002 tax credits from coke battery production decreased in both years reflecting the sale of a 49 interest in two of our coke battery projects in 2001 in 2002 consistent with the original purchase and sale agreement our interest in the third coke battery was reduced from 95 to 5 operating revenues and expenses increased significantly in 2002 and 2001 reflecting higher synfuel production synfuel projects generate operating losses which are offset by the resulting tax credits   31 outlook — energy services strategy is to continue leveraging our extensive energyrelated operating experience and construction management capability to develop and grow the onsite energy and merchant generating businesses we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell interests in some or all of our synfuel plants sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable net income base coke battery tax credits expired at two of our three facilities in 2002 and the synfuel tax credits are scheduled to expire in 2007 energy marketing  trading energy marketing  trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading company and coenergy trading company which was acquired as part of the mcn energy acquisition in may 2001 energy marketing  trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy’s natural gas pipeline and storage assets  to this end energy marketing  trading enters into forwards futures swaps and option contracts as part of its trading strategy factors impacting income earnings decreased 19 million in 2002 and increased 34 million in 2001 due to varying marktomarket gains resulting from changes in gas and electric prices commodity price risk of the energy marketing  trading segment is managed by utilizing derivative financial contracts to offset the risk inherent in the segment’s portfolio of electric and gas supply and sales agreements the segment’s objective is to enter into new transactions that can be hedged and profitable from an economic standpoint energy marketing  trading accounts for this risk minimization strategy by marking to market its commodity forwards and financial derivatives so they substantially offset this fair value accounting better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is managed and its performance measured in 2001 energy marketing  trading experienced earnings volatility as a result of its productionrelated gas supply as well as from open positions related to its longterm gas transportation and storage assets the segment receives gas produced from dte energy’s exploration  production ep operations which is used to meet its commitments under long term contracts with cogeneration customers the ep gas does not qualify for marktomarket accounting energy marketing  trading recorded a gain in 2001 totaling approximately 50 million net of taxes primarily attributable to marking to market sales contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss from marking to market the productionrelated gas supply in december 2001 energy marketing  trading entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation customers  energy marketing  trading deploys a gas storage marketing and trading strategy primarily utilizing the facilities owned and operated by dte energy employing a combination of physical and financial contracts in conjunction with the injection and withdrawal capabilities of the storage fields the segment is able to capture seasonal price spreads as forward prices change the timing of the physical flow of gas is optimized to obtain the highest margin trades under this strategy are marked to market against the forward curve through december 2002 physical gas in storage was marked to the current spot price under fair value accounting rules this difference in accounting for forward trades and gas in storage resulted in earnings volatility in 2002 and 2001 when price changes in the spot month did not correspond with those in future delivery months gas in storage in december 2002 was priced at a spot market rate of 510 per thousand cubic feet mcf compared to 277 per mcf in december 2001 and a may 31 2001 acquisition date rate of 410 per mcf significantly smaller changes in forward prices occurred during these same periods as a result the marktomarket gains and losses on gas inventory were only partially offset by marktomarket losses and gains on the storagerelated derivatives outlook — energy marketing  trading will seek to gradually expand this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments gas storage and 32 transportation capacity enhances its ability to provide reliable and customtailored bundled services to largevolume end users and utilities this capacity coupled with the synergies from dte energy’s other businesses positions the segment to capitalize on opportunities for expansion of its market base energy marketing  trading manages commodity price risk by utilizing derivative financial contracts to more fully balance its portfolio of gas and electric supply and sales agreements energy marketing  trading attempts to maintain a balanced or flat book from an economic standpoint however energy marketing  trading will experience earnings volatility as a result of its gas inventories and associated hedges as discussed in note 2 effective january 1 2003 gas inventory does not qualify for marktomarket accounting as a result of the rescission of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9810 nonregulated — other our other nonregulated businesses are comprised of our coal services and biomass units coal services specializes in minimizing energy production costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energyintensive use customers biomass develops owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the us gas produced from these landfill sites qualifies for section 29 tax credits factors impacting income  earnings rose 1 million in 2002 and 13 million in 2001 reflecting higher revenues from an increase in the shipment of coal as well as an increase in revenues and tax credits resulting from an increase in gas produced outlook — we expect to continue to grow our coal services and biomass units biomass currently has 30 operating sites and other projects under development section 29 tax credits related to biomass operations expire in 2007 energy distribution power distribution  transmission power distribution  transmission operations include the electric distribution services and steam heating businesses of detroit edison and the electric transmission services of the international transmission company itc energy distribution distributes electricity generated by energy resources and alternative electric suppliers to detroit edison’s 21 million customers   factors impacting income earnings decreased 33 million in 2002 and increased 11 million in 2001 the 2002 decrease is due primarily to increased operating and maintenance expenses partially offset by higher operating revenue operation and maintenance expenses were affected by expenses associated with restoring power to customers who lost service during two catastrophic storms during 2002 as well as 33 heatrelated maintenance expenses due to prolonged periods of above normal summer temperatures and the related stress placed on the distribution system additionally operation and maintenance expenses reflect increased costs associated with customer service process improvements uncollectible accounts expense and employee benefit expenses operating revenues increased due primarily to higher residential sales attributable to greater cooling demand the 2001 earnings improvement is due primarily to higher residential sales resulting from weather partially offset by the impact of a 5 rate reduction that began in june 2000 below are volumes associated with the regulated power distribution and transmission business  outlook — regulated electric system deliveries are expected to continue to increase in 2003 due to continued territory and economic growth operating results are expected to vary as a result of various external factors such as weather changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms in january 2003 we sold our steam business and will record a net of tax loss in the 2003 first quarter of approximately 13 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 we entered into an agreement to sell itc for 610 million the sale closed on february 28 2003 and generated a net of tax gain of approximately 75 million several midwest utilities seek to recover lost transmission revenues associated with the creation of multiple regional transmission organizations in the midwest positions advocated by several parties in a federal energy regulatory commission ferc proceeding could require that detroit edison and its customers be responsible for increased transmission costs detroit edison continues to actively participate in this proceeding and depending upon the outcome would subsequently seek rate recovery of these costs nonregulated nonregulated energy distribution operations consist primarily of dte energy technologies that markets and distributes a broad portfolio of distributed generation products provides application engineering and monitors and manages system operations factors impacting income losses increased 6 million during 2002 due primarily to expenses associated with the establishment of new sales offices in the distributed generation business outlook — dte energy technologies expects to continue the expansion of its product portfolios and support capabilities in north america and the development of marketing relationships in other parts of the world we plan to develop and launch new products in 2003 that are critical to our plan to increase revenues and generate operating profits by 2004 34 energy gas gas distribution gas distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily provided by michcon our gas utility that purchases stores and distributes natural gas to 12 million residential commercial and industrial customers located throughout michigan   factors impacting income gas distribution had income of 66 million in 2002 compared to 15 million in 2001 the significant improvement in 2002 reflects a full year of operations from michcon which was acquired in conjunction with the mcn energy merger in may 2001 in contrast to 2001 the 2002 results include the january through april period when demand for natural gas is at its highest warmer than normal weather during 2002 and 2001 reduced gas distribution’s earnings by 11 million and 13 million respectively operations and maintenance expenses in 2002 were affected by higher uncollectible accounts expense employee benefit expenses and costs associated with customer service process improvements the proforma impact of the mcn energy acquisition on dte energy is discussed in note 4 — acquisitions and dispositions outlook — gas restructuring is expected to continue to result in increased customer choice in the gas sales business in december 2001 the mpsc issued an order that continues the gas customer choice program on a permanent and expanding basis beginning with the conclusion of the threeyear temporary program on march 31 2002 under the expanded program beginning april 1 2002 up to approximately 40 of customers could elect to purchase gas from suppliers other than michcon beginning in april 2003 up to approximately 60 of customers could participate and beginning april 2004 all 12 million of michcon’s gas customers could choose to participate since michcon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on michcon’s earnings as of december 2002 approximately 190000 customers were participating in the gas customer choice program 35 under the mpsc order michcon returned to a gas cost recovery gcr mechanism upon termination of its threeyear experimental gas sales program in december 2001 under the gcr mechanism the gas commodity component of michcon’s sales rates is designed to recover the actual costs of gas purchases in december 2001 the mpsc issued an order permitting michcon to implement gcr factors up to 362 per mcf for january 2002 billings and up to 438 per mcf for the remainder of 2002 the order also allowed michcon to recognize a regulatory asset of approximately 14 million representing the difference between the 438 factor and the 362 factor for volumes that were unbilled at december 31 2001 the regulatory asset will be subject to the 2002 gcr reconciliation process in july 2002 in response to a petition for rehearing filed by the michigan attorney general the mpsc directed the parties to address michcon’s implementation of the december 2001 order and the impact of that implementation on rates charged to michcon’s customers also in july 2002 an mpsc administrative law judge alj issued a proposal for decision on michcon’s 2002 gcr plan case in that decision the alj recommended adoption of the mpsc staff’s proposed 265 million reduction in gas cost due to michcon’s decision to utilize storage gas during 2001 that resulted in a gas inventory decrement for the 2001 calendar year on march 12 2003 the mpsc ordered michcon to reduce revenues by 265 million for purposes of calculating the 2002 gcr expense in the 2002 gcr reconciliation proceeding see note 6 — regulatory matters — gas industry restructuring and note 22 — subsequent event — regulatory matters — gas industry restructuring gas distribution’s future operating results will vary as a result of weather and changes in economic conditions nonregulated nonregulated operations include the gas and oil exploration  production business and the gas pipelines  processing business ep produces gas from proven reserves owned in northern michigan and sells the gas to the energy marketing  trading segment pipelines  processing has partnership interests in two interstate transmission pipelines seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field the assets of these businesses primarily support the energy marketing  trading segment factors impacting income earnings were 26 million in 2002 compared with 11 million in 2001 the results reflect a full year of operations of the ep and pipeline  processing businesses that were acquired in conjunction with the mcn energy acquisition in may 2001 outlook — we expect to further develop our gas production properties in northern michigan and our pipelines processing and storage assets to support other dte energy businesses additionally we expect to continue exploring opportunities in the coal bed methane gas production business to leverage our ep capabilities skills and experience corporate  other corporate  other had a loss of 52 million in 2002 compared with a loss of 14 million in 2001 the increased loss was due to higher interest expense resulting from increased debt and a full year impact of corporate debt assumed in the mcn energy acquisition additionally results reflect a reserve of 11 million pretax for the possible loss associated with direct loans to and the guarantee of debt of a technology investment 36 capital resources and liquidity   operating activities our consolidated net cash from operating activities increased 163 million in 2002 and decreased 204 million in 2001 we use cash derived from operating activities to maintain and expand our core electric and gas utility businesses and to grow our nonregulated businesses in addition we use cash from operations to retire longterm debt and pay dividends the increase in 2002 was attributable to higher net income after adjusting for noncash items depreciation amortization and deferred taxes partially offset by higher working capital requirements working capital requirements reflect an increase in accounts receivable and gas inventories accounts receivable collections were slowed in our utility business due to billing issues associated with our new combined billing system that have been resolved the decline in 2001 resulted primarily from lower earnings after adjusting for noncash items including merger and restructuring charges and higher working capital requirements working capital was affected by the seasonal requirements in the second half of 2001 of the gas business where cash is used to finance increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable outlook — we expect our cash flow from operations will increase in 2003 due to earnings growth and by better managing our working capital requirements including the continued focus of reducing past due accounts receivable these expected improvements will be partially offset by a 222 million contribution to our pension plan in january 2003 investing activities our net cash used for investing activities decreased 12 billion in 2002 and increased 16 billion in 2001 the cash consideration portion of the mcn energy acquisition totaled 12 billion and impacts the comparison of the periods in 2002 capital expenditures in regulated and nonregulated businesses were lower partially offset by reduced proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets in 2001 higher regulated capital expenditures at detroit edison were due to new air quality regulations that require reductions in nitrogen oxide levels as discussed in the following “environmental matters” section outlook — our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2003 totaling approximately 850 million of which approximately 700 million will be in regulated gas and electric operations and the remaining 150 million in nonregulated businesses 37 approximately 100 million of the regulated capital expenditures will be incurred by our power generation business to comply with new ozone and air quality regulations investments in new nonregulated growth businesses could push actual capital investments and expenditures over 1 billion the actual level of nonregulated investments and expenditures will depend on new market opportunities we also sold itc in 2003 for approximately 610 million the proposed level of investments and expenditures in future years is expected to be financed primarily with internally generated funds including proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets we will evaluate divesting of assets and investments that do not meet certain return criteria or are not consistent with our strategic direction to maximize shareholder value we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources both internal and external to meet anticipated capital requirements financing activities our consolidated net cash related to financing activities decreased 17 billion in 2002 and increased 2 billion in 2001 the 2001 issuance of 175 billion of securitization bonds and the 2001 issuance of 135 billion of longterm debt to finance the acquisition of mcn energy impacts the comparison of the periods in 2002 proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock were used for the redemption of higher cost debt and to reduce shortterm borrowings in 2001 proceeds from the issuance of securitization bonds and other detroit edison and michcon debt were used to repay debt and repurchase our common stock details of 2002 financing activities follows  in october 2002 dte energy detroit edison and michcon entered into separate revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 12 billion our revolving credit facilities contain customary covenants one important aspect of these agreements requires us to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than 65 to 1 and an “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1 see note 13 — shortterm credit arrangements and borrowings 38 dte energy detroit edison and michcon have effective shelf registrations with the sec that allow for the issuance of up to 19 billion of debt and equity securities in february 2003 michcon issued 200 million of 57 senior notes due in 2033 the proceeds were used for debt redemption outlook — our capitalization objective is to maintain our credit ratings through a strong balance sheet our capitalization objective is a 50 to 55 leverage target excluding certain debt principally securitization debt we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various nonregulated subsidiary transactions we do not anticipate any credit rating downgrades however in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately 200 million at december 31 2002 critical accounting estimates there are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment such estimates relate to regulation risk management and trading activities section 29 tax credits goodwill pension and post retirement costs and the allowance for doubtful accounts regulation a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation detroit edison michcon and itc currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 71 “ accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation ” application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and nonregulated businesses sfas no 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in nonregulated businesses future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 71 for some or all of our businesses if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no 71 on all our operations we estimate that the extraordinary noncash loss would be as follows   management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment risk management and trading activities all derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” through december 2002 trading activities were accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9810 “ accounting for energy trading and risk management activities ” effective january 2003 trading activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 see note 2 new accounting pronouncements 39 the offsetting entry to “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge accounting the fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each reporting period for changes using market sources such as  market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts effective in 2003 fair value measurements must be evidenced by similar transactions in the marketplace section 29 tax credits we have generated section 29 tax credits from our synfuel coke battery and biomass operations seven of our synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the internal revenue service irs with respect to their operations the remaining two rulings have been requested and are expected in 2003 these tax credits are subject to review by the irs and if we fail to prevail through the administrative and legal process there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section 29 tax credits our portion of tax credits generated was 250 million in 2002 up from 165 million in 2001 and 130 million in 2000 outside firms assist us in assuring we operate in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the law as well as calculating the value of tax credits goodwill certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations in accordance with sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired in order to perform these impairment tests we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation techniques which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit these cash flow estimates involve judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings as of december 31 2002 our goodwill totaled 21 billion and we determined that no impairment exists pension and postretirement costs our cost of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors including rates of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of increase in health care costs we had pension income for qualified pension plans of 9 million in 2002 and pension expense of 159 million in 2001 and 9 million in 2000 postretirement benefits expense for all plans was 70 million in 2002 104 million in 2001 and 44 million in 2000 pension and postretirement benefits expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 90 at december 31 2002 in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated input from our consultants including their review of asset class return expectations as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond markets our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 65 in equity markets 28 in fixed income markets and 7 invested in other assets because of market volatility we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate given market conditions we believe that 9 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on our plan assets despite the recent financial market downturn we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions including our expected rate of return at least annually 40 we base our determination of the expected return on plan assets for pension benefits on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a threeyear period because of this method the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded we have unrecognized net losses due to the recent unfavorable performance of the financial markets as of december 31 2002 we had cumulative losses of approximately 375 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets these unrecognized net losses may result in increases in our future pension expense the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 725 at december 31 2001 to 675 at december 31 2002 due to recent financial market performance lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates we estimate that our 2003 pension expense will approximate 70 million and our postretirement benefit expense will approximate 141 million we have also made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of the higher costs future actual pension and postretirement benefit expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design lowering the expected longterm rate of return on our pension plan assets by 05 would have increased our 2002 pension expense by approximately 12 million and our postretirement benefit expense by 3 million lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by 05 would have increased our pension expense for 2002 by approximately 3 million lowering the discount rate and the health care cost trend assumptions by 05 would have decreased our postretirement benefit expense for 2002 by approximately 4 million the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by sharp declines in the financial markets since 2000 the value of our plan assets has decreased from 28 billion at december 31 2001 to 24 billion at december 31 2002 the investment performance returns and declining discount rates have required us to recognize at december 31 2002 an additional minimum pension liability of 855 million an intangible asset of 57 million and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders’ equity of 518 million net of tax the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries would be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements will increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the financial markets we made a 35 million cash contribution to the pension plan in 2002 and a 222 million cash contribution in january 2003 we also contributed 33 million to the postretirement plans in 2002 and expect to contribute at 80 million by the end of 2003 41 allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers historical trends economic conditions age of receivables and other information with the implementation of a new integrated billing system in late 2001 we encountered billing issues that resulted in an mpsc inquiry we filed a plan with the mpsc in march 2002 addressing customer billing complaints while we have resolved the primary billing issues we may encounter difficulty in collecting past due receivables as a result our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2002 we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates however failure to collect our past due receivables could unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow environmental matters protecting the environment as well as correcting past environmental damage continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators legislation and or rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including detroit edison the environmental protection agency epa and the michigan department of environmental quality have aggressive programs to cleanup contaminated property the epa initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison the national energy policy development group is reviewing the epa’s interpretation and application of regulations for new source review requirements we expect this review to focus on the ability of fossilfueled plant owners to perform plant maintenance without additional significant environmentally related modifications while we anticipate continued ability to economically maintain our plants the outcome of this governmental review cannot be predicted epa ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will impact us detroit edison has spent approximately 460 million through december 2002 and estimates that it will incur approximately 300 million to 400 million of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to comply new
