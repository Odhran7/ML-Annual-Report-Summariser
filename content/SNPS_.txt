background 

in this era of smart everything we have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of smart devices numerous software applications have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices the increasing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is now common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors transistors are the basic building blocks for ics each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair 

these devices are manufactured using masks to direct beams of light onto a wafer of silicon at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet 3d transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production 

the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and lower power consumption our customers who design those products are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” than competitors the design of these chips and systems is extremely complex and necessitates stateoftheart solutions over the past several years market verticals including artificial intelligence ai 5g automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to the ongoing demand for our products and services 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software arena whether the software is embedded on a chip or used in other applications the pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly frequent release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix despite these challenges it is crucial to have highquality secure code to ensure consumers privacy and safety especially at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices 

our role—as the silicon to software partner 

synopsys silicon to software technologies and services are designed to help our customers — chip and system engineers and software developers — to speed up time to market achieve the highest quality of results mitigate risk and maximize profitability 

chip and system designers must determine how best to design locate and connect the building blocks of chips and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this is a complex multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming our wide range of products help at different steps in the overall design process from the design of individual ics to the design of larger systems our products increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are ready to use in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

software developers are responsible for writing code that not only accomplishes its goals as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of defects we offer products that can help developers write higher quality more secure code by analyzing code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner as developers make use of open source software in their code our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they are less costly to fix

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below some of these risks are highlighted in the following discussion and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations legal proceedings and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the occurrence of any of these risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider all relevant risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

industry risks 

uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

uncertainty caused by the recent challenging global economic conditions including due to the effects of the recent rise in inflation and interest rates and the continuing covid19 pandemic could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us such caution by customers could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts 

economic conditions could continue to deteriorate in the future and in particular the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow including as a result of the effects of among other things rising inflation and interest rates a sustained global semiconductor shortage supply chain disruptions the covid19 pandemic and any disruption of international trade relationships such as tariffs export licenses or other government trade restrictions furthermore china’s stated policy of becoming a global leader in the semiconductor industry may lead to increased competition and further disruption of international trade relationships including but not limited to additional government trade restrictions for more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the us government’s entity list and export regulations as defined below see “ industry risks – we are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services which could impair our ability to compete in international markets ” 

adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that our products help create such as the ics incorporated in personal computers smartphones automobiles and servers longerterm reduced demand for these or other products could result in reduced demand for design solutions and significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales over time future economic downturns could also adversely affect our business in addition if our customers or distributors build elevated inventory levels we could experience a decrease in shortterm andor longterm demand for our products if any of these events or disruptions were to occur the demand for our products and services could be adversely affected along with our business operating results and financial condition further the negative impact of these events or disruptions may be deferred due to our business model 

further economic instability could also adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations additionally the banking and financial services industries are subject to complex laws and are heavily regulated there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to the laws policies and regulations governing our industry the banking and financial services industry and the economy could affect our business including rising global interest rates a deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 

the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the eda industry as a whole our semiconductor  system design segment product sales and to some extent our software integrity segment product sales are dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers systems companies and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of socs ics electronic systems and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led to and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general for example in response 

to this increasing complexity some customers may choose to focus on one discrete phase of the design process or opt for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls including due to rising inflation and global interest rates a continued or worsening global supply chain disruption or the impact of the covid19 pandemic additionally as the eda industry has matured consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacturing of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products work effectively together as we may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our products may not be competitive or may become obsolete 

in our semiconductor  system design segment we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and siemens eda we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products in the area of ip products we compete against a growing number of ip providers as well as our customers’ internally developed ip 

in our software integrity segment we compete with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive with new competitors entering these markets both domestically and internationally for example china has implemented national policies and investment funds to try to build independent eda capabilities and compete internationally in the semiconductor industry the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements for example the adoption of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies can bring new demands and also challenges in terms of disruption to both business models and our existing technology offerings semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

• our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts innovate rapidly and efficiently improve our existing software and hardware products and successfully develop or acquire such new products 

• our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance 

• our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights price discounts and other differentiating rights such as multiple tool copies postcontract customer support “remix” rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products and the ability to purchase pools of technology 

• our ability to manage an efficient supply chain to ensure availability of hardware products 

• our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms and 

• our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products 

if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

we are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services which could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

we are subject to export controls laws and regulations that restrict selling shipping or transmitting certain of our products and services and transferring certain of our technology outside the united states these requirements also restrict domestic release of software and technology to certain foreign nationals in addition we are subject to customs and other import requirements that regulate imports that may be important for our business 

if we fail to comply with the us export administration regulations or other us or nonus export requirements collectively the export regulations we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and the possible loss of the ability to engage in exporting and other international transactions due to the nature of our business and technology the export regulations may also subject us to governmental inquiries regarding transactions between us and certain foreign entities for example we have received administrative subpoenas from the us bureau of industry and security the bis requesting production of information and documentation relating to transactions with certain chinese entities we believe that we are in full compliance with all applicable regulations and are working with the bis to respond to its subpoenas however we cannot predict the outcome of the inquiries or their potential effect on our operations or financial condition 

we believe that current export regulations do not materially impact our business at this time but we cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future the united states has published significant changes to export regulations with respect to russia and china and we anticipate additional changes to the export regulations in the future for example the united states government has implemented controls on advanced computing ics computer commodities that contain such ics and certain semiconductor manufacturing items as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing endusers the new controls expand the scope of foreignproduced items subject to license requirements for certain entities on the us governments entity list future changes in the export regulations including changes in the enforcement and scope of such regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products or services in international markets or could prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or services globally in some cases such changes could prevent the export or import of our products 

consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services further we depend on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenues consolidation among our customers could also reduce demand for our products and services if customers streamline research and development or operations or reduce or delay purchasing decisions 

reduced customer spending or the loss of customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors may acquire businesses and technologies to 

complement and expand our respective product offerings consolidated competitors could have considerable financial resources and channel influence as well as broad geographic reach which would enable them to be more competitive in product differentiation pricing marketing services support and more if our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies that we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio additional support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

business operations risks 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us we have also continually expanded our nonus operations this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

• ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights 

• uncertain economic legal and political conditions in china europe and other regions where we do business including for example changes in chinataiwan relations the military conflict between russia and ukraine and the related sanctions and other penalties imposed on russia by the united states the european union the united kingdom and other countries 

• economic recessions or uncertainty in financial markets including the impact of rising inflation and global interest rates 

• government trade restrictions including tariffs export controls or other trade barriers and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries such as china 

• difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anticorruption laws 

• financial risks such as longer payment cycles changes in currency exchange rates and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions 

• additional taxes interest and potential penalties and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries and 

• other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters terrorism civil unrest war and infectious diseases and pandemics including covid19 and its variants 

furthermore if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries such as china where we derive a growing percentage of our revenue and the united states that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes export restrictions and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption export restriction or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers increase the cost of our products and services have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending make our products less competitive or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses and our results of operations for example the ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty between the us and china the unknown impact of current and future us and chinese trade regulations as described above and other geopolitical risks with respect to china and taiwan may cause disruptions in the markets and industries we serve and our supply chain decrease demand from customers for products using our solutions or cause other disruptions which could directly or indirectly materially harm our 

business financial condition and results of operations for more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the us government’s entity list and export regulations see “ industry risks – we are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services which could impair our ability to compete in international markets ” 

in response to the us adopting tariffs and trade barriers or taking other actions other countries may also adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business in addition government or customer efforts attitudes laws or policies regarding technology independence may lead to nonus customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products which would also have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations such as those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly in addition there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statements of income likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies including the renminbi or yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors including interest rate changes and political and economic uncertainty therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused minor disruptions to our business operations to date but could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition in the future for example we have previously experienced limited hardware supply chain and logistical challenges as well as a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment in response to the covid19 pandemic governments and businesses imposed restrictions which significantly curtailed global regional and national economic activity and have caused substantial volatility and disruption in global financial markets we are continuing to transition employees back into offices worldwide while maintaining compliance with applicable local state and national requirements although we have been able to navigate workplace restrictions and limitations with minimal disruptions to our business operations to date we cannot be certain that these measures will continue to be successful and we may need to further modify our business practices and real estate needs in response to the risks and negative impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic its overall negative impact on the global economy and in some cases the regional and national economies of areas experiencing localized surges in covid19 cases continued responses by governments and businesses to covid19 and its variants acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines the ability of our business partners and thirdparty providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments the ability to secure adequate and timely supply of equipment and materials from suppliers for our hardware products and the ability to develop and deliver our products in addition continued and worsening weak economic conditions may result in impairment in value of our tangible and intangible assets the 

impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this risk factors section 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

• changes in demand for our products—especially products such as hardware generating upfront revenue—due to fluctuations in demand for our customers’ products and due to constraints in our customers’ budgets for research and development and eda products and services 

• changes in demand for our products due to customers reducing their expenditures whether as a costcutting measure or a result of their insolvency or bankruptcy and whether due to inflationary pressures rising global interest rates a sustained global semiconductor shortage the ongoing covid19 pandemic or other reasons 

• product competition in the eda industry which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation 

• our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire 

• failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services 

• our ability to implement effective cost control measures 

• our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenue 

• changes to the amount composition and valuation of and any impairments to or writeoffs of our inventory 

• changes in the mix of our products sold as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins such as our hardware products may reduce our overall margins 

• expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technologies 

• changes in tax rules as well as changes to our effective tax rate including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions and tax audit settlements 

• delays increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products which includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components 

• natural variability in the timing of ip drawdowns which can be difficult to predict 

• general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries such as disruptions to international trade relationships including tariffs export licenses or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers’ products as well as impacts due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and 

• changes in accounting standards which may impact the way we recognize our revenue and costs and impact our earnings 

the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include 

• cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and timebased products revenue 

• delay of one or more orders for a particular period particularly orders generating upfront products revenue such as hardware 

• delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

• delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development as to which customers have paid for early access 

• customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods and 

• the levels of our hardware and ip revenues which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements 

these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers on our networks or on the cloud these systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information many employees continue to work remotely based on a hybrid work model which magnifies the importance of maintaining the integrity of our remote access security measures 

for example we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet plus customer license and product delivery system in 2015 while we identified and remediated the incident it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and any such breach could adversely impact our business operations and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques react in a timely manner or implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that have access to our network and store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards however that is no guarantee that a breach will not still occur in addition if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage of information as part of their service or product offerings or if we are selected as a vendor for our cloudbased solutions our proprietary information could be misappropriated by third parties despite our attempts to validate the security of such services any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to sell our products and services 

our software products hosted solutions and software security and quality testing solutions may also be vulnerable to attacks including phishing exploits of our code or our system configurations malicious code such as viruses and worms distributed denialofservice attacks sophisticated attacks conducted or sponsored by nationstates advanced persistent threat intrusions ransomware and other malware furthermore the risk of statesupported and geopoliticalrelated cybersecurity incidents may increase due to geopolitical incidents such as the russiaukraine conflict an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information or cause other destructive outcomes 

we also offer software security and quality testing solutions if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services and could result in a loss of customers or sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our 

visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure if any of the foregoing were to occur we could experience negative publicity and our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and other thirdparties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue if their efforts are successful some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

from time to time we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

• assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property 

• defend our products from piracy 

• protect our trade secrets or knowhow or 

• determine the enforceability scope and validity of the propriety rights of others 

if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 

• potential negative impact on our earnings per share 

• failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales 

• problems in integrating the acquired products with our products 

• difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions 

• potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products 

• difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees 

• substantial reductions of our cash resources andor the incurrence of debt which may be at higher than anticipated interest rates 

• failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings 

• difficulties in integrating or expanding sales marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems including information technology and human resources systems 

• dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration 

• difficulties in negotiating governing and realizing value from strategic investments 

• assumption of unknown liabilities including tax litigation cybersecurity and commercialrelated risks and the related expenses and diversion of resources 

• incurrence of costs and use of additional resources to remedy issues identified prior to or after an acquisition 

• disruption of ongoing business operations including diversion of management’s attention and uncertainty for employees and customers particularly during the postacquisition integration process 

• potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers distributors and business partners 

• exposure to new operational risks regulations and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business 

• the need to implement controls processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have previously lacked such controls processes and policies in areas such as cybersecurity information technology privacy and more 

• negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition or investmentrelated costs and 

• requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business 

if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may pursue new product and technology initiatives and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives we could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we may invest in efforts to expand into adjacent markets including for example software security and quality testing solutions although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services and our efforts in this area may not be successful our success in these and other new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 

• our ability to attract a new customer base including in industries in which we have less experience 

• our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements 

• our ability to accurately predict prepare for and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields including in the case of our software quality testing and security tools and services identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages 

• our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries many of which may have more financial resources industry experience brand recognition relevant intellectual property rights or established customer relationships than we currently do and could include free and open source solutions that provide similar software quality testing and security tools without fees 

• our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services 

• our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields 

• our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins and 

• our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services 

difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets including as a result of delays or disruptions new export control restrictions or the ongoing covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their product offerings our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results new products may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace new software products may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities the occurrence of any defects or errors in our products could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products delays in payment by customers loss of customers or market share product returns damage to our reputation diversion of our resources increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions increased insurance costs and potential liability for damages finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors including those resulting from thirdparty suppliers could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

our hardware products which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems subject us to distinct risks 

the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks including 

• increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion 

• increasingly variable revenue and less predictable revenue forecasts due to fluctuations in hardware revenue which is recognized upfront upon shipment as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time 

• potential reductions in overall margins as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products 

• longer sales cycles which create risks of insufficient excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation which can adversely affect our operating results 

• decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of nextgeneration releases which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products 

• longer warranty periods than those of our software products which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty thus increasing our costs and 

• potential impacts on our supply chain including due to the effects of increasing inflationary pressures and rising global interest rates a sustained global semiconductor shortage and the covid19 pandemic 

if we fail to timely recruit andor retain senior management and key employees globally our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of our senior management team to drive our future success and certain team members depart our company from time to time if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team without adequate notice our business could be adversely affected 

to be successful we must also attract and retain key employees who join us organically and through acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified engineers competition for these individuals and other qualified employees is intense and has increased globally including in major markets such as asia our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers worldwide any failure to recruit and retain key employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition and our recruiting and retention efforts may be negatively impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products are alleged to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating res ults for example some customers have requested we defend and indemnify them against claims for patent infringement asserted in various district courts and at the us international trade commission by bell semiconductor llc bell semic a patent monetization entity based on bell semic’s allegation that the customers’ use of one or more features of certain of our products infringes one or more of six patents held by bell semic we have offered to defend some of our customers consistent with the terms of our end user license agreement 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to these thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our 

potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management’s attention from the operation of our business 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions valuation allowances on deferred tax assets allowances for credit losses and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2022 approximately 48 of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries we intend to meet our us cash spending needs primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

legal and regulatory risks 

our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations changes in our geographical earnings mix unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates future changes to our tax structure or by evolving enforcement practices 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or limitations on our ability to utilize tax credits could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows for example in response to the fiscal impact of the covid19 pandemic the state of california enacted legislation on june 29 2020 that suspends the use of certain corporate research and development tax credits for a threeyear period beginning in our fiscal 2021 which resulted in an impact to our tax expense on february 9 2022 california governor newsom signed into law 2022 ca sb 113 which shortened the previously enacted suspension on the use of research and development tax credits to a twoyear period covering our fiscal 2021 and 2022 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act tax act was enacted which significantly changed prior us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business the tax act includes certain provisions that began to affect our income in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 while other sections of the tax act and related regulations will begin to affect our business in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 there are various proposals in congress to amend certain provisions of the tax act the state of these proposals and other future legislation remains uncertain and if enacted may materially affect our financial position 

on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act of 2022 ir act was enacted in the united states the ir act includes a minimum tax rate of 15 as well as tax credit incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions the details of the computation of the tax and implementation of the incentives will be subject to regulations to be issued by the us department of the treasury on august 9 2022 the chips and science act of 2022 chips act was enacted in the united states to provide certain financial incentives to the semiconductor industry primarily for manufacturing activities within the united states we are continuing to monitor the ir act and chips act and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business and operating results 

on october 8 2021 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd announced the oecdg20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting framework which agreed to a twopillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy on december 20 2021 the oecd released pillar two model rules defining the global minimum tax rules which contemplate a minimum tax rate of 15 the oecd continues to release additional guidance on these rules and the framework calls for law enactment by oecd and g20 members to take effect in 2023 and 2024 these changes when enacted by various countries in which we do business may increase our taxes in these countries changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years 

our income and nonincome tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations if any under the tax act although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made for further discussion on our ongoing audit see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “nonus examinations” 

we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits how such credits are treated under current and potential future tax law changes to the tax act other regulatory changes and changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations including with respect to environmental social and governance matters that could expose us to numerous risks 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the financial accounting standards board fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance difficult and uncertain in addition increasingly regulators customers investors employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental social and governance esg matters and related disclosures these changing rules regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations for example developing and acting on esg initiatives and collecting measuring and reporting esg information and metrics can be costly difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards including the sec’s proposed climaterelated reporting requirements we may also communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental matters diversity responsible sourcing social investments and other esg matters in our sec filings or in other public disclosures these initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace and ensuring the accuracy adequacy or completeness of the disclosure of our esg initiatives can be costly difficult and timeconsuming further statements about our esg initiatives and goals and progress against those goals may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in addition we could face scrutiny from certain stakeholders for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals if our esgrelated data processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our esg goals on a timely basis or at all our business financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

changes in the us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the fasb the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics including for example revenue recognition and accounting for leases these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment customer supplier competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

general risks 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets 

from time to time our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk and may be negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions and rising global interest rates fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

catastrophic events and the effects of climate change may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events and the effects of climate change throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire extreme temperatures drought flood telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or pandemic including the ongoing covid19 pandemic or other catastrophic events or climate changerelated events could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders in particular our sales and infrastructure are vulnerable to regional or worldwide health conditions including the effects of the outbreak of contagious diseases such as the covid19 pandemic moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and 

certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults and sites of recent wildfires which may become more frequent along with other extreme weather events due to climate change a catastrophic event or other extreme weather event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase decrease or be eliminated 

hungarian tax matter 

in 2017 the hungarian tax authority the hta assessed withholding taxes of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million against our hungary subsidiary synopsys hungary synopsys hungary contested the assessment with the hungarian administrative court administrative court in 2019 as required under hungarian law synopsys hungary paid the assessment and recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of 174 million which is net of estimated us foreign tax credits the administrative court found against synopsys hungary and we appealed to the hungarian supreme court during 2021 the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal and remanded the case to the administrative court for further proceedings the administrative court once again ruled against synopsys hungary and we filed another appeal with the hungarian supreme court the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on january 27 2022 vacated the lower courts decision and remanded th e case back to the administrative court for further proceedings  hearings with the administrative court were held on june 30 2022 and september 22 2022 in response to a request by the administrative court we filed an additional brief on november 23 2022 we expect a hearing to be scheduled in early 2023

overview 

the following overview is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in item 8 of this form 10k please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys provides products and services used across the entire silicon to software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code we are a global leader in electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits ics also known as chips we also offer semiconductor intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves we provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them we also provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems these products and services are part of our semiconductor  system design segment 

we are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services automotive medicine energy and industrials these tools and services are part of our software integrity segment 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets and our customers spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 

our software integrity segment delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code  while it is being written  for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance our software integrity customers are software developers across many industries including but also well beyond the semiconductor and systems industries our software integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain 

we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005 despite periods of global economic uncertainty we achieved these results because of our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period which typically approximates three years see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on our revenue recognition policy  the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period as a result decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings driving growth in the software security and quality market and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time based and upfront products based on our leading technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully 

recent developments 

developments in export control regulations 

on october 7 2022 the bureau of industry and security bis of the us department of commerce published changes to us export control regulations us export regulations including new restrictions on chinese entities ability to obtain advanced computing chips develop and maintain supercomputers and manufacture advanced semiconductors further on october 14 2022 a new rule went into effect imposing us export controls on additional technologies including electronic computeraided design software specially designed for the development of ics with gateallaround fieldeffect transistor structures based on our current understanding we believe these regulations will not have a material impact on our business we anticipate additional changes to us export regulations in the future but we cannot forecast the scope or timing of such changes we will continue to monitor such developments including potential additional trade restrictions and other regulatory or policy changes by the us and foreign governments 

for more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the us government’s entity list and other us export regulations see part i item 1a risk factors “ industry risks – we are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services which could impair our ability to compete in international markets ” 

impact of the current macroeconomic environment and covid19 

uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment including due to the effects of the recent rise in global inflation and interest rates supply chain disruptions geopolitical pressures including the unknown impact of current and future us and chinese trade regulations changes in chinataiwan relations and the war in ukraine fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and associated global economic conditions have resulted in volatility in credit equity and foreign currency markets 

these uncertain macroeconomic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we experienced a minor impact from the current macroeconomic environment in our software integrity segment as customers applied elevated levels of scrutiny to purchasing decisions which has in some cases caused some customers to elect shorter term contracts due to their own budget uncertainty if these uncertain macroeconomic conditions persist they may continue to have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our business 

additionally the ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economic activity and financial markets and significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty despite this widespread volatility and uncertainty the covid19 pandemic has caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors including the duration of the pandemic and its overall negative impact on the global economy generally and the semiconductor and electronics industries specifically we have not identified trends that we expect will materially impact our future operating results at this time and continue to consider the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations 

while our timebased business model provides stability to our business operating results and overall financial position the broader implications of these macroeconomic events particularly in the long term remain uncertain further the negative impact of these events or disruptions may be deferred due to our business model 

see part i item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the impact of global economic uncertainty and ongoing covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial condition

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year when a 53week year occurs we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 were 52week years ending on october 29 2022 october 30 2021 and october 31 2020 respectively fiscal 2023 will be a 52week year 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to the closest calendar month end 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our significant accounting policies 

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

• revenue recognition and 

• business combinations 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer arrangements with customers can involve multiple products and various license rights customers can negotiate for a broad portfolio of solutions and favorable terms along with future purchase options to manage their overall costs analysis of the terms and conditions in these contracts and their effect on revenue recognition may require significant judgment 

we have concluded that our eda software licenses in technology subscription license tsl contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term because those promises represent inputs to a single combined performance obligation where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses updates and technical support because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same timebased pattern of transfer to the customer 

for our ip licensing arrangements we have concluded that the licenses and support services are distinct from each other and therefore treated as separate performance obligations revenues from ip licenses are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the ip license and support services are recognized over the support period as a stand ready obligation to the customer 

we are required to estimate total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers in some circumstances the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract generally we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities deferred revenue which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with our revenue recognition policy in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies as if we had originated the contracts the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimates for intangible assets although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

• future expected cash flows from software license sales subscriptions support agreements consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents 

• historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers 

• estimated obsolescence rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets 

• the expected use of the acquired assets and 

• discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value which are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks 

the fair value of the definitelived intangibles was determined using variations of the income approach 

for acquired existing technology the fair value was determined by applying the multiperiod excess earnings method under the income approach which involves isolating the net earnings attributable to the asset being measured based on present value of the incremental aftertax cash flows excess earnings attributable solely to the asset over its remaining useful life the economic useful life was determined based on historical technology obsolescence patterns and prospective technology developments for acquisitions completed in fiscal 2022 we assumed technological obsolescence ranging from 6 to 10 years the present value of operating cash flows from the existing technology was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 10 to 30 

customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships with the acquired company’s customers their fair value was determined using the distributor method of the income approach a variation of the multiperiod excess earnings method the distributor method relies upon marketbased distributor data to estimate the excess profits associated with the asset over its remaining useful life the economic useful life was determined based on historical customer turnover rates projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging from 925 to 975 the present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 10 to 15 

we believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets are reasonable but significant judgment is involved 

results of operations 

the discussion of our consolidated results of operations includes yearoveryear comparisons of fiscal 2022 changes compared to fiscal 2021 for a discussion of the fiscal 2021 changes compared to fiscal 2020 see the discussion in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 31 2021 filed on december 13 2021 

fiscal 2022 financial performance summary 

results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 reflected the following 

• revenues were 51 billion an increase of 8773 million or 21 due to higher revenue resulting from growth across all products and geographies 

• total cost of revenue and operating expenses were 39 billion an increase of 4501 million or 13 primarily due to increases of 3792 million in employeerelated costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions 

• operating income was 12 billion an increase of 4272 million or 58 as revenue growth exceeded the growth in costs and expenses 

revenue 

our revenues are generated from two business segments the semiconductor  system design segment and the software integrity segment see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions 

further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows 

semiconductor  system design segment 

this segment is comprised of the following 

• eda software includes digital custom and fpga ic design software verification products and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services eda products and services are typically sold through technology subscription license tsl arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement the duration of our tsl contracts is generally 3 years though it may vary for specific arrangements we have concluded that the software licenses in tsl contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term because the multiple software licenses and support represent inputs to a single combined offering and timely relevant software 

updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses we recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under tsl contracts ratably over the term of the license 

• ip  system integration includes our designware® ip portfolio and systemlevel products and services these arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed ip and providing related support which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time revenue allocated to the ip licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our ip payments for ip contracts are generally received upon delivery of the ip revenue related to the customization of certain ip is recognized as “professional services” 

• in the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products we generally have two performance obligations the first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software which includes rights to technical support hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same timebased pattern of transfer to the customer the portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time we have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware the portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term 

• revenue from professional service contracts is recognized over time generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress we have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 

software integrity segment 

• we sell software integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses maintenance updates and technical support over the term of these arrangements the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities the licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation we recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement 

our customer arrangements can involve multiple products and various license rights and our customers negotiate with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they generally request a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 



our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience fluctuations in our revenues due to factors such as the timing of ip product sales consulting projects flexible spending account fsa drawdowns royalties and hardware sales as 

revenues from ip products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront customer demand and timing requirements for such ip products and hardware could result in increased variability of our total revenues 

contracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations as of october 31 2022 were  71 billion the amount and composition of unsatisfied performance obligations will fluctuate period to period we do not believe the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations is indicative of future sales or revenue or that such obligations at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance of a particular geography or particular products and services f or more information regarding our revenue as of october 31 2022 including our contract balances as of such date see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 revenues increased due to the continued organic growth of our business in all product groups and geographies 

for a discussion of revenue by geographic areas see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

timebased products revenue 



the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue and higher renewals from arrangements booked in prior periods 

upfront products revenue 



changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of ip products and hardware products driven by higher demand from customers 

upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of ip products and hardware sales such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments or fsa drawdowns due to customer requirements 

maintenance and service revenue 



the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of hardware and ip arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of ip consulting projects  

cost of revenue 



we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of products revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets 

cost of products revenue cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed hardwarerelated costs allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized software development costs 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes costs to deliver our maintenance and consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets included in cost of revenue includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology and certain contract rights intangible assets 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to 1027 million in employeerelated costs as a result of headcount increases from organic growth and acquisitions 517 million in hardwarerelated costs 184 million in amortization of technologyrelated intangible assets 164 million in costs to fulfill ip consulting arrangements and 127 million in facility costs these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 115 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

operating expenses 

research and development 



the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to higher employeerelated costs of 1991 million as a result of headcount increases as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio increases of 192 million in facility costs and 155 million in consultant and contractor costs these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 865 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

sales and marketing 



the increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to increases of 641 million in employeerelated costs due to headcount increases and higher sales commissions 120 million in travel and marketing costs due to an increased number of inperson meetings and events and 30 million in facility costs these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 255 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets   

general and administrative 



the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to increases of 308 million in legal consulting and other professional fees 186 million in maintenance and depreciation expenses and 133 million in personnelrelated costs due to headcount increases from hiring these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 169 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and bad debt recoveries of 159 million 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no impact on our net income from the fair value changes in our deferred compensation plan obligation and related assets 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets included within operating expenses consists of the amortization of trademarks trade names and customer relationships related to acquisitions 



the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2022 partially offset by amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2022  

restructuring charges 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 our management approved committed and initiated a restructuring plan the 2021 plan as part of a business reorganization total charges under the 2021 plan consisting primarily of severance retirement benefits and lease abandonment costs were 455 million of which 334 million was incurred in fiscal 2021 and 121 million was incurred in fiscal 2022  the 2021 plan was substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

the following is a summary of our restructuring liabilities 

see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information  

other income expense net 



the decrease in other income expense for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

segment operating results 

we do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments these unallocated expenses consist primarily of stockbased compensation expense amortization of intangible assets changes in the fair value of deferred compensation plan restructuring litigation and acquisitionrelated costs see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

semiconductor  system design segment 



the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

software integrity segment 



the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 is 123 which included a tax benefit of 615 million of us federal research tax credit a foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction of 389 million and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 888 million 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 61 which included a tax benefit of 455 million of us federal research tax credit a fdii deduction of 312 million and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 940 million 

the tax act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31 2017 that were not subject to the onetime transition tax we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

in 2017 the hungarian tax authority the hta assessed withholding taxes of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million against our hungary subsidiary synopsys hungary synopsys hungary contested the assessment with the hungarian administrative court administrative court in 2019 as required under hungarian law synopsys hungary paid the assessment and recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of 174 million which is net of estimated us foreign tax credits the administrative court found against synopsys hungary and we appealed to the hungarian supreme court during 2021 the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal and remanded the case to the administrative court for further proceedings the administrative court once again ruled against synopsys hungary and we filed another appeal with the hungarian supreme court the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on january 27 2022 vacated the lower courts decision and remanded th e case back to the administrative court for further proceedings  hearings with the administrative court were held on june 30 2022 and september 22 2022 in response to a request by the administrative court we filed an additional brief on november 23 2022 we expect a hearing to be scheduled in early 2023 

see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes the impacts related to the tax act and the hungarian audit  

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 

as of october 31 2022  we held 16 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments we also held 23 million in restricted cash primarily associated with deposits for office leases our cash equivalents consisted primarily of taxable money market mutual funds time deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less our shortterm investments include us government and municipal obligations investmentgrade availableforsale debt and asset backed securities we believe that the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa 

as of october 31 2022 approximately 7551 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over at least the next 12 months we are currently not aware of any trends or demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months our future cash requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts we also may invest in or acquire businesses applications or technologies or may further expand our boardauthorized stock repurchase program which may require the use of significant cash resources andor additional financing 

cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased products revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher net income and higher accounts receivable collection partially offset by timing of customer billings and higher disbursements for operations including vendor and tax payments 

cash used in investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions of 1264 million and higher purchases of property and equipment of 428 million partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 808 million and lower purchases of shortterm investments of 645 million 

cash used in financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher stock repurchases of 3119 million higher debt repayments of 488 million and higher taxes paid for net share settlements of 351 million partially offset by higher proceeds from issuance of common stock of 272 million 

credit and term loan facilities 

on january 22 2021 we entered into a fourth extension and amendment agreement the fourth amendment which amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated as of november 28 2016 as amended and restated the credit agreement our outstanding borrowings under the previous credit agreement which as of january 22 2021 consisted of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of 975 million  were carried over under the credit agreement and fully paid on november 26 2021 

the fourth amendment extended the termination date of the existing 6500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver from november 28 2021 to january 22 2024 which could be further extended at our option the credit agreement also provides an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to 1500 million in the aggregate principal amount the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as well as other nonfinancial covenants as of october 31 2022  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 

there was no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31 2022 and october 31 2021 we expect our borrowings if any under the revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 

borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement as of october 31 2022  the revolver bore interest at libor 1  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0125 and 0200 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

in july 2018 we entered into a 12year 2200 million renminbi approximately 330 million credit agreement with a lender in china to support our facilities expansion borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5year loan prime rate plus 074 as of october 31 2022 we had a 208 million outstanding balance under the agreement 

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors the board previously approved a stock repurchase program the program with authorization to purchase up to 10 billion of our common stock in december 2021 the board approved a replenishment of the program up to 15 billion in september 2022 

during the fiscal year 2022 we repurchased 36 million shares of common stock at an average price of 31451 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 11 billion as of october 31 2022 14 billion remained available for future stock repurchases the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for acquisitions our debt repayment obligations our stock price and economic and market conditions 

the ir act was enacted in the united states on august 16 2022 the ir act imposes a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after december 31 2022 the total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year we are assessing the potential impact of the stock repurchase excise tax based on our preliminary assessment we do not expect a material impact on our overall capital allocation strategy or our consolidated financial statements risks related to the ir act are described in part i item 1a risk factors  

contractual and other obligations 

our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

leases 

we have operating lease arrangements for office space data center equipment and other corporate assets as of october 31 2022  we had lease payment obligations net of immaterial sublease income of 5693 million with 545 million payable within 12 months 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october 31 2022  we had 6611 million of purchase obligations with 3674 million payable within 12 months although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 

term loan 

refer to credit and term loan facilities” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

long term accrued income taxes 

as of october 31 2022  we had 188 million of longterm accrued income taxes which represent uncertain tax benefits currently a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2022 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to financial market risks primarily due to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and nonmarketable equity security price none of market risk sensitive instruments are held for speculative trading purposes 

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and outstanding debt as of october 31 2022 all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable or fixed interest rates as of october 31 2022 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 1479 million these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of october 31 2022 were as follows 

foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statements of income likewise a strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies including the renminbi or yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation if the us dollar continues to strengthen this could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in addition increased international sales in the future may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales increasing our foreign currency risk our operating expenses incurred outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 27 months see note 2 and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts  

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors including interest rate changes and political and economic uncertainty therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2022 the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 195 million and we would be required to pay approximately 195 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in positive cash flow of approximately 195 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record gains or losses depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2022 was as follows 



equity price risk our nonmarketable equity securities investments totaled 319 million and 176 million as of october 31 2022 and 2021 respectively our strategic investments include privatelyheld companies that are considered to be in the startup or development stages and have a higher inherent risk specifically the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover the evaluation of these investments is based on information provided by these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data provided

background 

in this era of smart everything we have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of smart devices numerous software applications apps have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices the increasing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is now common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors transistors are the basic building blocks for ics each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair 

these devices are manufactured using masks to direct beams of light onto a wafer of silicon at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet or 3d transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production 

the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and lower power consumption our customers who design those products are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” than competitors the design of these chips and systems is extremely complex and necessitates stateoftheart solutions over the past several years market verticals including ai 5g automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to the ongoing demand for our products and services 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software arena whether the software is embedded on a chip or used in other applications the pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly frequent release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices it is crucial to have highquality secure code to ensure consumers’ privacy and safety 

our role—as the silicon to software partner 

synopsys silicon to software technologies and services are designed to help our customers — chip and system engineers and software developers — to speed time to market achieve the highest quality of results mitigate risk and maximize profitability 

chip and system designers must determine how best to design locate and connect the building blocks of chips and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this is a complex multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming our wide range of products help at different steps in the overall design process from the design of individual ics to the design of larger systems our products increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are ready to use in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

software developers are responsible for writing code that not only accomplishes its goals as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of defects we offer products that can help developers write higher quality more secure code by analyzing code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner as developers make use of open source software in their code our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they are less costly to fix

the covid19 pandemic has caused minor disruptions to our business operations to date and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition in the future for example we have experienced limited hardware supply chain and logistical challenges as well as a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment in response to the covid19 pandemic governments and businesses have taken unprecedented actions to contain the virus including requiring social distancing implementing travel restrictions instituting shelterinplace orders and various other restrictions on nonessential businesses these restrictions have significantly curtailed global economic activity and have caused substantial volatility and disruption in global financial markets we transitioned most of our employees in affected regions to work remotely in order to comply with applicable restrictions and government requirements  and implemented travel restrictions and other changes to our business operations we are continuing to transition employees back into offices in select jurisdictions in conformity with local guidelines and regulations each office must follow physical distancing guidelines and affirmative health measures in compliance with applicable local state and national requirements for instance on november 5 2021 the occupational safety and health administration issued an interim final rule that requires employers with 100 or more employees to develop to implement and to enforce a mandatory covid19 vaccination policy unless unvaccinated employees comply with masking and testing requirements such requirements are currently scheduled to be effective on january 4 2022 although we have been able to navigate workplace restrictions and limitations with minimal disruptions to our business operations to date we may further modify our business practices and real estate needs in response to the risks and negative impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic but we cannot be certain that these measures will continue to be successful 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic its overall negative impact on the global economy and in some cases the regional and national economies of areas experiencing a localized surge in covid19 cases continued responses by governments and businesses to covid19 and its variants the ability to secure timely payment from customers the ability to accurately estimate customer demand reduced willingness of current and potential customers to purchase our products and services due to their own business and market uncertainties the ability of our business partners and thirdparty providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments the ability to secure adequate and timely supply of equipment and materials from suppliers for our hardware products  and the ability to develop and deliver our products while our operations have experienced minor disruptions to date in connection with localized surges in cases a continued and sustained increase in the amount of covid19 cases or the emergence of additional variants in countries or regions where we have operations could have a material adverse effect on our or our customers businesses operations and financial conditions in addition continued weak economic conditions may result in impairment in value of our tangible and intangible assets the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this “risk factors” section 

industry risks 

uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

uncertainty caused by the recent challenging global economic conditions including due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us such caution by customers could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts outside of a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment we have not seen evidence of impacts on customer orders from the covid19 pandemic to date 

we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate economic conditions could deteriorate in the future and in particular the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow including as the result of the effects of among other things the covid19 pandemic a sustained global semiconductor shortage supply chain disruptions or delays and any disruption of international trade relationships such as tariffs export licenses or other government trade restrictions furthermore china’s stated policy of becoming a global leader in the semiconductor industry may lead to increased competition and further disruption of international trade relationships  including but not limited to additional government trade restrictions  for more on risks related to government trade restrictions such as the united states government’s “entity list” see “ business operations risks–the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business ” 

adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that our products help create such as the ics incorporated in personal computers smartphones and automobiles and servers longerterm reduced demand for these or other products could result in reduced demand for design solutions and significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales over time future downturns could also adversely affect our business in addition if our customers or distributors build elevated inventory levels we could experience a decrease in shortterm andor longterm demand for our products if any of these events or disruptions were to occur the bookings for our products and services could be adversely affected along with our business operating results and financial condition further the negative impact of these events or disruptions may be deferred due to our business model similarly in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 

further economic instability could also adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations additionally the banking and financial services industries are subject to complex laws and heavily regulated there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to the laws and regulations governing our industry the banking and financial services industry and the economy could affect our business a deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 

the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the eda industry as a whole our semiconductor  system design segment product sales and to some extent our software integrity segment product sales are dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers systems companies and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips ics electronic systems and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led to and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general for example in response to this increasing complexity some customers may choose to focus on one discrete phase of the design process or opt for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls including due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or a sustained global supply chain disruption additionally as the eda industry has matured consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products work effectively together as we may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry 

processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our products may not be competitive or may become obsolete and our business and financial condition may be harmed 

in our semiconductor  system design segment we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and siemens eda formerly mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products in the area of ip products we compete against a growing number of ip providers as well as our customers’ internally developed ip 

in our software integrity segment we compete with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive with new competitors entering these markets both domestically and internationally the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements for example the adoption of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies can bring new demands and also challenges in terms of disruption to both business models and our existing technology offerings semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

• our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts innovate rapidly and efficiently improve our existing software and hardware products and successfully develop or acquire such new products 

• our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance 

• our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights price discounts and other differentiating rights such as multiple tool copies postcontract customer support “remix” rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products and the ability to purchase pools of technology 

• our ability to manage an efficient supply chain to ensure availability of hardware products 

• our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms and 

• our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products 

if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services furthermore we depend on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenues consolidation among our customers could also reduce the demand for our products and services if customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions 

reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings consolidated competitors could have considerable financial resources channel influence and broad geographic reach thus they can engage in competition on the basis of product differentiation pricing marketing services support and more if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies that we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio additional support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

business operations risks 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us we have also continually expanded our nonus operations this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

• ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights 

• uncertain economic and political conditions in regions where we do business such as china or europe 

• government trade restrictions including tariffs export controls or other trade barriers and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries such as china 

• difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anticorruption laws 

• financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions 

• additional taxes interest and potential penalties and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries and 

• other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters terrorism civil unrest war and infectious diseases and pandemics including covid19 

furthermore if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries such as china where we derive a growing percentage of our revenue and the united states that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes export restrictions and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption export restriction or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where 

we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers increase the cost of our products and services have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending make our products less competitive or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses and our results of operations 

for example the united states government has placed certain entities on the entity list restricting the sale of us technologies to the named entities as a result of this government action unless and until the restriction is lifted we are not able to ship technologies subject to the us export administration regulations or provide support to these entities furthermore any company with knowledge that a customer will use certain us technologies to design or produce any item for a huaweiaffiliated company on the entity list must obtain a license prior to any export of such technologies the bureau of industry and security bis also added a military end user list where they identified more than one hundred chinese and russian companies that are considered to be military end users we believe that the restrictions imposed by the us government thus far will not materially impact our business at this time but cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future due to the nature of our business and technology governmental authorities may inquire into transactions between us and certain foreign entities for example we recently received an administrative subpoena from bis requesting production of information relating to transactions with certain chinese entities we believe we are in full compliance with all applicable regulations and are currently working with bis to respond to its subpoena however inquiries such as this one are subject to a number of uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry or its potential effect on our operations or financial condition 

in response to actions taken by the united states other countries may adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business in addition government or customer efforts attitudes laws or policies regarding technology independence may lead to nonus customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products which would also have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations such as those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly in addition there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statements of income likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies including the renminbi or yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

• changes in demand for our products—especially products such as hardware generating upfront revenue—due to fluctuations in demand for our customers’ products and due to constraints in our customers’ budgets for research and development and eda products and services 

• changes in demand for our products due to customers reducing their expenditures whether as a costcutting measure or a result of their insolvency or bankruptcy and whether due to the covid19 pandemic a sustained global semiconductor shortage or other reasons 

• product competition in the eda industry which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation 

• our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire 

• failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services 

• our ability to implement effective cost control measures 

• our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenue 

• changes to the amount composition and valuation of and any impairments to or writeoffs of our inventory 

• changes in the mix of our products sold as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins such as our hardware products may reduce our overall margins 

• expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technologies 

• changes in tax rules as well as changes to our effective tax rate including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions and tax audit settlements 

• delays increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products which includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components 

• natural variability in the timing of ip drawdowns which can be difficult to predict 

• general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries such as disruptions to international trade relationships including tariffs export licenses or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers’ products as well as impacts due to the covid19 pandemic and 

• changes in accounting standards which may impact the way we recognize our revenue and costs and impact our earnings 

the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include 

• cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and timebased products revenue 

• delay of one or more orders for a particular period particularly orders generating upfront products revenue such as hardware 

• delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

• delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development as to which customers have paid for early access 

• customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods and 

• the levels of our hardware and ip revenues which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements 

these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers on our networks or on the cloud despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information as a result of the covid19 pandemic and shelterinplace orders most of our employees in affected areas are working remotely which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures 

for example we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet plus customer license and product delivery system in 2015 while we identified and remediated the incident it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and any such breach could harm our business and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards a breach may still occur in addition if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage of information as part of their service or product offerings or if we are selected as a vendor for our cloudbased solutions our proprietary information could be misappropriated by third parties despite our attempts to validate the security of such services any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

our software products our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions may also be vulnerable to attacks including traditional computer hackers malicious code such as viruses and worms distributed denialofservice attacks sophisticated attacks conducted or sponsored by nationstates advanced persistent threat intrusions ransomware and other malware an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information or cause other destructive outcomes 

we also offer software security and quality testing solutions if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services and could result in a loss of customers or sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure as a result if any of the foregoing were to occur we could experience negative publicity and our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and other thirdparties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue if their efforts are successful some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

from time to time we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

• assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property 

• defend our products from piracy 

• protect our trade secrets or knowhow or 

• determine the enforceability scope and validity of the propriety rights of others 

if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 

• potential negative impact on our earnings per share 

• failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales 

• problems in integrating the acquired products with our products 

• difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions 

• potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products 

• difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees 

• substantial reductions of our cash resources andor the incurrence of debt 

• failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings 

• difficulties in integrating or expanding sales marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems including information technology and human resources systems 

• dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration 

• difficulties in negotiating governing and realizing value from strategic investments 

• assumption of unknown liabilities including tax litigation cybersecurity and commercialrelated risks and the related expenses and diversion of resources 

• incurrence of costs and use of additional resources to remedy issues identified prior to or after an acquisition 

• disruption of ongoing business operations including diversion of management’s attention and uncertainty for employees and customers particularly during the postacquisition integration process 

• potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers distributors and business partners 

• exposure to new operational risks regulations and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business 

• the need to implement controls processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have previously lacked such controls processes and policies in areas such as cybersecurity information technology privacy and more 

• negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition or investmentrelated costs and 

• requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business 

if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we may invest in efforts to expand into adjacent markets including for example software security and quality testing solutions although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services and our efforts in this area may not be successful our success in these and other new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 

• our ability to attract a new customer base including in industries in which we have less experience 

• our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements 

• our ability to accurately predict prepare for and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields including in the case of our software quality testing and security tools and services identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages 

• our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries many of which may have more financial resources industry experience brand recognition relevant intellectual property rights or established customer relationships than we currently do and could include free and open source solutions that provide similar software quality testing and security tools without fees 

• our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services 

• our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields 

• our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins and 

• our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services 

difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets including delays or disruptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their product offerings our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results new products may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace new software products may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities the occurrence of any defects or errors in our products could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products delays in payment by customers loss of customers or market share product returns damage to our reputation diversion of our resources increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions increased insurance costs and potential liability for damages finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors including those resulting from thirdparty suppliers could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

our hardware products which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems subject us to distinct risks 

the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks including 

• increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion 

• increasingly variable revenue and less predictable revenue forecasts due to fluctuations in hardware revenue which is recognized upfront upon shipment as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time 

• potential reductions in overall margins as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products 

• longer sales cycles which create risks of insufficient excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation which can adversely affect our operating results 

• decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of nextgeneration releases which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products 

• longer warranty periods than those of our software products which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty thus increasing our costs and 

• potential impacts on our supply chain including due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and a sustained global semiconductor shortage 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees globally our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected 

to be successful we must also attract and retain key employees who join us organically and through acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified engineers and competition for these individuals and other qualified employees is intense and has increased globally including in major markets such as asia our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers worldwide any failure to recruit and retain key employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition and our recruiting and retention efforts may be negatively impacted by restrictions on travel and business activity due to the covid19 pandemic additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to these thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management’s attention 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open 

source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions valuation allowances on deferred tax assets allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results in addition we cannot predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations the uncertainty affects management’s estimates and assumptions which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2021 approximately 51 of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries we intend to meet our us cash spending needs primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

legal and regulatory risks 

our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations changes in our geographical earnings mix unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates future changes to our tax structure or by evolving enforcement practices 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or limitations on our ability to utilize tax credits could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows for example in response to the fiscal impact of the covid19 pandemic the state of california enacted legislation on june 29 2020 that would suspend the use of certain corporate research and development tax credits for a threeyear period beginning in our fiscal 2021 which resulted in an impact in our tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which significantly changed prior us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business the tax act includes certain new provisions that began to affect our income from foreign operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 further president biden has proposed the american jobs act and various bills have been introduced by members of the house of representatives and the senate proposing changes to the corporate tax rate as well as other provisions on august 9 2021 the senate released the fiscal 2022 budget resolution with reconciliation instructions for a potential 35 trillion spending bill the house ways and means committee introduced a 35 trillion spending bill on september 12 2021 which proposes to raise the corporate rate to 265 and amend certain provisions of the tax act and on october 28 2021 the house rules committee introduced a revised bill which maintains the current corporate tax rate at 21 while introducing a new corporate minimum tax of 15 of adjusted financial statement income as well as other modifications to the tax act which if enacted may materially affect our financial position accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the programme of work to develop a concensus solution to the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy programme of work agreement by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd which represents a coalition of member countries including the united states the programme of work is evaluating potential changes to numerous longstanding tax principles on october 8 2021 the oecd announced the oecdg20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting framework which agreed to a twopillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy pillar one provides a framework for the reallocation of certain residual profits of multinational enterprises to market jurisdictions using a revenuebased allocation key to source to the end market jurisdictions where goods or services are used or consumed pillar two consists of two interrelated rules referred to as global antibase erosion rules which operate to impose a minimum tax rate of 15 calculated on a jurisdictional basis the framework calls for law enactment by oecd and g20 members in 2022 to take effect in 2023 and 2024 these changes when enacted by various countries in which we do business may increase our taxes in these countries changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years 

our income and nonincome tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations if any under the tax act although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million we paid the tax assessments penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet on april 30 2019 the hungarian administrative court the administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on november 12 2020 and remanded the case to the administrative court for further proceedings we received the hungarian supreme court’s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on april 27 2021 the administrative court reheard the case and again ruled against synopsys hungary we received the written opinion from the administrative court on may 19 2021 and filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 19 2021 the hearing for the appeal is scheduled for january 27 2022 for further discussion of the hungary audit see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading nonus examinations 

we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits how such credits are treated under current and potential future tax law changes to the tax act and changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 

the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics including for example revenue recognition and accounting for leases these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results for example the new revenue recognition standard became applicable to us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and there is an increased volatility in our total revenue with less predictability than under the prior accounting standard 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment customer supplier competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations including “conflict minerals” regulations affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets 

from time to time our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk and may be negatively impacted by the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

general risks 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire extreme temperatures drought flood telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or pandemic including the covid19 pandemic or other catastrophic event or climate changerelated risk could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders in particular our 

sales and infrastructure are vulnerable to regional or worldwide health conditions including the effects of the outbreak of contagious diseases such as the covid19 pandemic moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults and sites of recent historic wildfires a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase decrease or be eliminated 

in july 2017 the hta issued a final assessment against synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta disallowed synopsys hungarys tax positions taken during these years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 445 million and interest and penalties of 180 million on august 2 2017 synopsys hungary filed a claim contesting the final assessment with the administrative court on november 16 2017 synopsys hungary paid the assessment as required by law while continuing its challenge to the assessment in court hearings were held in february and july 2018 february 26 2019 and april 30 2019 on december 10 2018 synopsys withdrew its claim contesting the final assessment with regard to the timing of the deduction of research expenses resulting in a remaining disputed tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million on april 30 2019 the administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary the administrative courts opinion was received on may 16 2019 synopsys hungary filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the administrative courts decision we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of 174 million which is net of estimated us foreign tax credits for the tax assessments the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on november 12 2020 and remanded the case to the administrative court for further proceedings we received the hungarian supreme court’s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on april 27 2021 the administrative court reheard the case and again ruled against synopsys hungary we received the written opinion from the administrative court on may 19 2021 and filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 19 2021 the hearing for the appeal is scheduled for january 27 2022

the following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in item 8 of this form 10k please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys inc provides products and services used across the entire silicon to software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits ics also known as chips we also offer semiconductor intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves we provide 

software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them to complement these offerings we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems these products and services are part of our semiconductor  system design segment 

we are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services automotive medicine energy and industrials these tools and services are part of our software integrity segment 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets and our customers spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 

our software integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code  while it is being written  for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance our software integrity customers are software developers across many industries including but also well beyond the semiconductor and systems industries our software integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain 

we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005 despite periods of global economic uncertainty we achieved these results because of our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period which typically approximates three years see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion on our revenue recognition policy  the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period as a result decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings driving growth in the software security and quality market and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time based and upfront products based on our leading technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully 

covid19 pandemic 

while the covid19 pandemic has changed the physical working environment of the substantial majority of our workforce to working from home it has otherwise caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far given the unpredictable nature of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on the global economy our historical results may not be an indication of future performance 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic its overall negative impact on the global economy generally and the semiconductor and electronics industries specifically and continued responses by governments and businesses to covid19 we have not identified trends that we expect will materially impact our future operating results at this time as we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period any potential impact related to covid19 may be delayed we have not observed any changes in the design activity of customers but we experienced a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment we have not received any significant requests from our customers to either delay payments or modify arrangements due to covid19 however this situation could change in future periods and the extent that these requests may impact our business is uncertain we have also experienced minor disruptions in our hardware supply chain which we have been able to address with minimal impact to our business operations to date 

we will continue to consider the potential impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations although no material impairment or other effects have been identified to date related to the covid19 pandemic there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time that uncertainty affects 

management’s accounting estimates and assumptions which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions as additional events and information become known 

see part i item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial condition

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year when a 53week year occurs we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 were 52week years ending on october 30 2021 october 31 2020 and november 2 2019 respectively fiscal 2022 will be a 52week year 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to the closest calendar month end 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our significant accounting policies 

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

• revenue recognition 

• valuation of business combinations and 

• income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer arrangements with customers can involve multiple products and various license rights customers can negotiate for a broad portfolio of solutions and favorable terms along with future purchase options to manage their overall costs analysis of the terms and conditions in these contracts and their effect on revenue recognition may require significant judgment 

we have concluded that our eda software licenses in timebased subscription license tsl contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term because those promises represent inputs to a single combined performance obligation where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses updates and technical support because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same timebased pattern of transfer to the customer 

for our ip licensing arrangements we have concluded that the licenses and support services are distinct from each other and therefore treated as separate performance obligations revenues from ip licenses are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the ip license and support services are recognized over the support period as a stand ready obligation to the customer 

valuation of business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

• future expected cash flows from software license sales subscriptions support agreements consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents 

• historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers 

• estimated obsolescence rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets 

• the expected use of the acquired assets and 

• discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value which are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks 

unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities in addition we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations we believe such estimates to be reasonable however the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

changes from prior periodic reports 

in this annual report on form 10k we have revised our disclosures to comply with sec release no 3310825 “modernization of regulation sk items 101 103 and 105” in addition we have adopted the changes in the disclosure standards included in sec release no 3310890 “management’s discussion and analysis selected financial data supplementary financial information” 

modernization of regulation sk items 101 103 and 105 

the sec issued release no 3310825 “modernization of regulation sk items 101 103 and 105” effective for annual periods beginning subsequent to november 2020 this release was adopted to simplify the description of business legal proceedings and risk factor disclosures that registrants are required to make pursuant to regulation sk specifically this release requires registrants to provide disclosures relating to their human capital resources and to restructure their risk factor disclosures additionally the release increases the threshold for disclosure of environmental proceedings to which the government is a party 

management’s discussion and analysis selected financial data and supplementary financial information 

the sec issued release no 3310890 “management’s discussion and analysis selected financial data supplementary financial information” which became fully effective on august 9 2021 this release was adopted to simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in regulation sk specifically the sec eliminated the requirement for selected financial data only requiring quarterly disclosure when there are retrospective changes affecting comprehensive income and amending the matters required to be presented under management’s discussion and analysis mda to among other things eliminate the requirement to include the contractual obligations table 

with our adoption of this release we have eliminated from this document the items discussed above that are no longer required information on our contractual obligations is still disclosed in narrative form within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations 

the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include yearoveryear comparisons of fiscal 2021 changes compared to fiscal 2020 for a discussion of the fiscal 2020 changes compared to fiscal 2019 see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 31 2020 filed on december 15 2020 

fiscal 2021 financial performance summary 

results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 reflect the following 

• revenues were 42042 million an increase of 5189 million or 14 primarily due to higher revenue resulting from growth across all products and geographies 

• total cost of revenue and operating expenses were 34694 million an increase of 4043 million or 13 primarily due to increases of 3422 million in employeerelated costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions 

• operating income was 7348 million an increase of 1146 million or 18 as revenue growth exceeded the growth of costs and expenses 

revenue 

our revenues are generated from two business segments the semiconductor  system design segment and the software integrity segment see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions 

further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows 

semiconductor  system design segment 

this segment is comprised of the following 

• eda software includes digital custom and fpga ic design software verification products and 

obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services eda products and services are typically sold through tsl arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement and software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement the duration of our tsl contracts is generally 3 years though it may vary for specific arrangements we have concluded that the software licenses in tsl contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term because the multiple software licenses and support represent inputs to a single combined offering and timely relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses we recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under tsl contracts ratably over the term of the license 

• ip  system integration includes our designware® ip portfolio and systemlevel products and services these arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed ip and providing related support which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time revenue allocated to the ip licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our ip payments for ip contracts are generally received upon delivery of the ip revenue related to the customization of certain ip is recognized as “professional services” 

• in the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products we generally have two performance obligations the first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software which includes rights to technical support hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same timebased pattern of transfer to the customer the portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time we have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware the portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term 

• revenue from professional service contracts is recognized over time generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress we have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 

software integrity segment 

• we sell software integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses maintenance updates and technical support over the term of these arrangements the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities the licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation we recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement 

our customer arrangements can involve multiple products and various license rights and our customers negotiate with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they may request a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 



our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience fluctuations in our revenues due to factors such as the timing of ip product sales consulting projects flexible spending account fsa drawdowns royalties and hardware sales as revenues from ip products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront customer demand and timing requirements for such ip products and hardware could result in increased variability of our total revenues 

for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 revenues increased primarily due to the continued organic growth of our business in most product categories and regions as a result of increased investments by our customers in new complex designs for their hardware and software products across a wide range of industries 

for a discussion of revenue by geographic areas see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

timebased products revenue 



the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue and higher renewals from arrangements booked in prior periods 

upfront products revenue 



changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of ip products and hardware products driven by higher demands from customers 

upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of ip products and hardware sales such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments or fsa drawdowns due to customer requirements 

maintenance and service revenue 



the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of hardware and ip arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of ip consulting projects  

cost of revenue 



we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of products revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of products revenue cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed hardware related direct costs allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized software development costs 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes costs to deliver our maintenance and consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology and certain contract rights intangible 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increases of 548 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases from hiring and acquisitions 200 million in hardware related costs and higher deferred compensation expenses of 46 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 53 million in depreciation and maintenance expense a decrease of 40 million in servicing ip consulting arrangements expense and a reduction of 40 million in amortization of intangible assets as certain technologyrelated intangibles assets became fully amortized during 2021 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 



the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs of 1760 million from headcount increases from hiring and acquisitions as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio 97 million in consultant and contractor costs 74 million in facility expenses as well as higher deferred compensation expenses of 293 million 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 



the increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase of 718 million in personnelrelated costs due to headcount increases from hiring and higher sales commissions as well as higher deferred compensation expenses of 110 million partially offset by a decrease of 48 million in travel costs as a result of covid19 restrictions 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

general and administrative 



the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase of 396 million in personnelrelated expenses from headcount increases from hiring and higher deferred compensation expenses of 50 million 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no impact to our net income from the fair value changes in our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names and customer relationships related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of income as follows 



the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2021 partially offset by amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2021  

restructuring charges 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 our management approved committed and initiated a restructuring plan the 2021 plan as part of a business reorganization total charges under the 2021 plan are expected to be in the range of 42 million to 53 million and consist primarily of severance retirement benefits under the 2021 voluntary retirement program 2021 vrp and lease abandonment costs restructuring charges under the 2021 plan are anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

the following is a summary of our restructuring liabilities 

see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information  

interest and other income expense net 



the increase in other income expense for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increase in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

segment operating results 

we do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments these unallocated expenses consist primarily of stockbased compensation expense amortization of intangible assets restructuring litigation and acquisitionrelated costs see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

semiconductor  system design segment 



the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

software integrity segment 



the decrease in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses partially offset by an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 61 which included a tax benefit of 455 million of us federal research tax credit a foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction of 312 million and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 940 million 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 40 which included a tax benefit of 392 million of us federal research tax credit a fdii deduction of 243 million and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 723 million 

the tax act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31 2017 that were not subject to the onetime transition tax we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority the hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million we paid the tax assessments penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet on april 30 2019 the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the courts decision we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of 174 million which is net of estimated us foreign tax credits for the tax assessments the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on november 12 2020 and remanded the case to the hungarian administrative court for further proceedings we received the hungarian supreme courts written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on april 27 2021 the administrative court reheard the case and again ruled against synopsys hungary we received the written opinion from the administrative court on may 19 2021 we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 19 2021 the hearing for the appeal is scheduled for january 27 2022 

see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes the impacts related to the tax act and the hungarian audit  

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 

as of october 31 2021 we held 15808 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments our cash equivalents consisted primarily of taxable money market mutual funds time deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less our shortterm investments include us government and municipal obligations investmentgrade availableforsale debt and asset backed securities we believe that the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa 

as of october 31 2021 approximately 7991 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond our future cash requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts we also may invest in or acquire complementary businesses applications or technologies or may further expand our boardauthorized stock repurchase program which may require the use of significant cash resources andor additional financing 

cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased products revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher operating income and higher cash collections 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchase of shortterm investments of 1617 million and higher cash paid for acquisitions of 950 million partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment of 610 million 

cash used in financing activities 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher stock repurchases of 5460 million and higher income taxes paid for net share settlements of 567 million 

credit and term loan facilities 

on november 28 2016 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders  as amended and restated the credit agreement providing for i a 6500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan on january 22 2021 the credit agreement was amended credit agreement to extend the termination date of the existing 650 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility from november 28 2021 to january 22 2024 which may be further extended at our option further the credit agreement was also amended to provide an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to 1500 million in the aggregate principal amount 

our outstanding term loan borrowings under the previous credit agreement carried over under the credit agreement as of october 31 2021 we had 750 million in aggregate principal amount in outstanding balance under the term loan there was no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31 2021 

in july 2018 we entered into a 12year 2200 million rmb approximately 330 million credit agreement with a lender in china to support our facilities expansion borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5year loan prime rate plus 074 as of october 31 2021 we had 251 million outstanding under the agreement the remaining outstanding balance of 750 million was repaid in full on november 26 2021 

share repurchase program 

our board of directors previously approved a stock repurchase program up to 5000 million of our common stock and approved a replenishment of the stock repurchase program of up to 5000 million in june 2021 during the fiscal year 2021 we repurchased 28 million shares of common stock at an average price of 27084 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 7531 million as of october 31 2021 1100 million remained available for future share repurchases i n december 2021 our board approved a stock repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to 10 billion of our common stock the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for acquisitions our debt repayment obligations our stock price and economic and market conditions 

contractual and other obligations 

our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

leases 

we have operating lease arrangements for office space data center equipment and other corporate assets as of october 31 2021 we had lease payment obligations net of immaterial sublease income of 5883 million with 804 million payable within 12 months 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october 31 2021 we had 3017 million of purchase obligations with 1518 million payable within 12 months although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 

term loan 

refer to “other commitments – credit and term loan facilities” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

long term accrued income taxes 

as of october 31 2021 we had 279 million of longterm accrued income taxes which represent uncertain tax benefits currently a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2021 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and outstanding debt as of october 31 2021 all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable or fixed interest rates as of october 31 2021 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 1479 million these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in 

our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of october 31 2021 are as follows 

foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 23 months see note 2 and note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts  

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2021 the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 135 million and we would be required to pay approximately 135 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in positive cash flow of approximately 135 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized gain of approximately 13 million and net unrealized loss of 34 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2021 was as follows 



equity risk we had approximately 176 million and 132 million of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the investments that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over are accounted for using the measurement alternative when the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable securities accounted for as equity method investments are recorded at cost plus the proportional share of the issuers’ income or loss which is recorded in the other income expense net investments are written down to the fair value when an event or circumstance which impacts the fair value of these investments indicates that the investments are impaired and the fair value of the investments is less than the carrying value none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

in this era of smart everything we have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of smart devices numerous software applications apps have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices the increasing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is now common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors transistors are the basic building blocks for ics each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production 

the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and lower power consumption our customers who design those products are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” than competitors the designs of these chips and systems are extremely complex and necessitate stateoftheart design solutions over the past several years market verticals including ai 5g automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to ongoing demand for our products and services 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software arena whether embedded on a chip or as a standalone the pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly frequent release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices it is crucial to have highquality secure code to ensure consumers’ privacy and safety 

our role—as the silicon to software partner 

synopsys silicon to software technologies and services are designed to help our customers — chip and system engineers and software developers — to speed time to market achieve the highest quality of results mitigate risk and maximize profitability 

chip and system designers must determine how best to design locate and connect the building blocks of chips and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this is a complex multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming our wide range of products help designers at different steps in the overall design process from the design of individual ics to the design of larger systems our products increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are ready to use in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

software developers are responsible for writing code that not only accomplishes their goals as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of defects we offer products that can help developers write higher quality more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner to the extent that developers make use of open source software in their code our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they are less costly to fix

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

covid19 pandemic risks 

the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has caused minor disruptions to our business operations to date and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition in the future for example we experienced limited hardware supply chain and logistical challenges as well as a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment in response to the covid19 novel coronavirus pandemic governments and businesses have taken unprecedented actions to contain the virus including social distancing travel restrictions shelterinplace orders and restrictions on nonessential businesses these restrictions have significantly curtailed global economic activity and have caused substantial volatility and disruption in global financial markets we transitioned most of our employees in affected regions to work remotely in order to comply with applicable restrictions and government requirements  and implemented travel restrictions and other changes to our business operations we are transitioning employees back into offices in select jurisdictions in conformity with local guidelines and regulations each office must follow physical distancing guidelines and affirmative health measures in compliance with different local and national requirements although we have been able to navigate workplace restrictions and limitations with minimal disruptions to our business operations to date we may further modify our business practices and real estate needs in response to the risks and negative impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic its overall negative impact on the global economy continued responses by governments and businesses to covid19 the ability to secure timely payment from customers the ability to accurately estimate customer demand reduced willingness of current and potential customers to purchase our products and services due to their own business and market uncertainties the ability of our business partners and thirdparty providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments the ability to secure adequate and timely supply of equipment and materials from suppliers for our hardware products  and the ability to develop and deliver our products in addition continued weak economic conditions may result in impairment in value of our tangible and intangible assets the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this “risk factors” section 

industry risks 

the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the electronic design automation eda industry as a whole our semiconductor  system design segment product sales and to some extent our software integrity segment product sales are dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers systems companies and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips integrated circuits electronic systems and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls including due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic additionally as the eda industry has matured consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and 

manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services furthermore we depend on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenue reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio additional support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

uncertainty caused by the recent challenging global economic conditions including due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us such caution by customers could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts outside of a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment we have not seen evidence of impacts on customer orders from the covid19 pandemic to date 

we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry the banking and financial services industry and the economy could affect our business in addition economic conditions could deteriorate in the future and in particular the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow including as the result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic and any disruption of international trade relationships such as tariffs export licenses or other government trade restrictions 

in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete and our business and financial condition may be harmed 

in our semiconductor  system design segment we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation now part of siemens ag we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers’ internally developed ip 

in our software integrity segment we compete with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements for example the adoption of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies can bring new demands and also challenges in terms of disruption to both business models and our existing technology offerings semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

business operations risks 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us we have also continually expanded our nonus operations this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 



 furthermore if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries such as china and the united states that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes export restrictions and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption export restriction or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers increase the cost of our products and services have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending make our products less competitive or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses and our results of operations 

for example beginning in may 2019 the united states government placed certain entities on the “entity list” restricting the sale of us technologies to the named entities as a result of this government action unless and until the restriction is lifted we are not able to ship products or provide support to these entities in addition in may 2020 the united states government placed further restrictions on certain entities on the entity list to prevent them from sharing designs developed using us software or technology with other entities on the entity list and obtaining semiconductors manufactured with processes that use us software and technology in august 2020 the entity list rules were further revised such that any company with knowledge that a customer will use certain us technologies to design or produce any item for a huaweiaffiliated company on the entity list must obtain a license prior to any export of such technologies we believe that this latest restriction will not materially impact our business at this time but cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future in response to these actions or similar actions taken by the united states other countries may adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business in addition government or customer efforts attitudes laws or policies regarding technology independence may lead to nonus customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products which would also have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly in addition there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statements of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies including the renminbi or yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 



the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include 

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information as a result of the covid19 pandemic and shelterinplace orders most of our employees in affected areas are working remotely which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures 

for example we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system in 2015 while we identified and remediated the incident it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and any such breach could harm our business and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards a breach may still occur any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

our software products including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information or cause other destructive outcomes as a result our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we offer software security and quality testing solutions if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code 

an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services and could result in a loss of customers or sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure successful attacks could damage our reputation as a securityfocused company 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and other thirdparties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue if their efforts are successful some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

from time to time we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 



 if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including software security and quality testing solutions although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services and our efforts in this area may not be successful our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 



 difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets including delays or disruptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors including those resulting from thirdparty suppliers could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

our hardware products which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems subject us to distinct risks 

the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks including 



 liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2020  approximately 52 of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries we intend to meet our us cash spending needs primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to these thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management’s attention 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join us in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical 

sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition and our recruiting and retention efforts may be negatively impacted by restrictions on travel and business activity due to the covid19 pandemic additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions valuation allowances on deferred tax assets allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results in addition we cannot predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations the uncertainty affects management’s estimates and assumptions which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions 

legal and regulatory risks 

changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 

the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics including for example revenue recognition and accounting for leases these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results for example the new revenue recognition standard became applicable to us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and there is an increased volatility in our total revenue with less predictability than the prior accounting standard 

our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations changes in our geographical earnings mix unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates future changes to our tax structure or by evolving enforcement practices 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or limitations on our ability to utilize tax credits could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows for example in response to the fiscal impact of the covid19 pandemic the state of california enacted legislation on june 29 2020 that would suspend the use of certain corporate research and development tax credits for a threeyear period beginning in our fiscal 2021 which could result in an impact in our tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which significantly changed prior us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business the tax act includes certain new provisions that began to affect our income from foreign operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 since the beginning of fiscal 2019 the us treasury department has issued proposed regulations that 

could have a material impact on our ability to claim certain tax benefits related to the tax act while we continue to evaluate the potential impact on our estimated annual tax rate certain of these regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change as additional regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may materially differ from previous estimates and those differences may materially affect our financial position accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the programme of work to develop a concensus solution to the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy programme of work agreement by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd which represents a coalition of member countries including the united states the programme of work is evaluating potential changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes if enacted by various countries in which we do business may increase our taxes in these countries changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years 

our income and nonincome tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations if any under the tax act although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million we paid the tax assessments penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet on april 30 2019 the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on november 12 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the hungarian administrative court for further proceedings we expect to receive the hungarian supreme court’s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 for further discussion of the hungary audit see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits how such credits are treated under provisions of the tax act changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment customer supplier competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations including “conflict minerals” regulations 

affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets 

from time to time our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk and may be negatively impacted by the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

general risks 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or pandemic including the covid19 pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders in particular our sales and infrastructure are vulnerable to regional or worldwide health conditions including the effects of the outbreak of contagious diseases such as the covid19 pandemic moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase decrease or be eliminated 

in july 2017 the hta issued a final assessment against synopsys hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta disallowed synopsys hungarys tax positions taken during these years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 445 million and interest and penalties of 180 million on august 2 2017 synopsys hungary filed a claim contesting the final assessment with the hungarian administrative court the court on november 16 2017 synopsys hungary paid the assessment as required by law while continuing its challenge to the assessment in court hearings were held in february and july 2018 february 26 2019 and april 30 2019 on december 10 2018 synopsys withdrew its claim contesting the final assessment with regard to the timing of the deduction of research expenses resulting in a remaining disputed tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million on april 30 2019 the court ruled against synopsys hungary the courts opinion was received on may 16 2019 synopsys hungary filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the courts decision we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of 174 million which is net of estimated us foreign tax credits for the tax assessments the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on november 12 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the hungarian 

administrative court for further proceedings we expect to receive the hungarian supreme court’s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021

we are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services automotive medicine energy and industrials these tools and services are part of our software integrity segment 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets and our customers spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 

our software integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code  while it is being written  for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance our software integrity customers are software developers across many industries including but also well beyond the semiconductor and systems industries our software integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain 

we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005 despite periods of global economic uncertainty we achieved these results because of our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships and because we recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period which typically approximates three years see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion on our revenue recognition policy  the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period as a result decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings driving growth in the software security and quality market and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market in addition due to our adoption of accounting standard codification 606 asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers in the beginning of fiscal 2019 the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements has increased the variability in our total revenue from period to period nevertheless the accounting impact has not affected the cash generated from our business based on our leading technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully 

covid19 pandemic 

while the covid19 pandemic has changed the physical working environment of the substantial majority of our workforce to working from home it has otherwise caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far given the unpredictable nature of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on the global economy our historical results may not be an indication of future performance 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic its overall negative impact on the global economy generally and the semiconductor and electronics industries specifically and continued responses by governments and businesses to covid19 we have not identified trends that we expect will materially impact our future operating results at this time as we recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period any potential impact related to covid19 may be delayed we have not observed any changes in the design activity of customers but we experienced a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment we have not received any significant requests from our customers to either delay payments or modify arrangements due to covid19 however this situation could change in future periods and the extent that these requests may impact our business is uncertain we have also experienced minor disruptions in our hardware supply chain which we have been able to address with minimal impact to our business operations to date 

we will continue to consider the potential impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations although no material impairment or other effects have been identified to date related to the covid19 pandemic there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time that uncertainty affects 

management’s accounting estimates and assumptions which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions as additional events and information become known 

see part i item 1a risk factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial condition

fiscal 2020 financial performance summary 

in fiscal 2020  compared to fiscal 2019  our financial performance reflects the following 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our significant accounting policies 

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 



 revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment we have concluded that our eda software licenses in timebased subscription license tsl contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term because those promises represent inputs to a single combined performance obligation where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses updates and technical support because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same timebased pattern of transfer to the customer in reaching this conclusion we considered the nature of our obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software as eda customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to the customers’ ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities in addition we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations we believe such estimates to be reasonable however the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

effect of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

we adopted new revenue guidance asc 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense the comparative information for periods prior to fiscal 2019 has not been restated 

revenue 

our revenues are generated from two business segments the semiconductor  system design segment and the software integrity segment see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions 

further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows 

semiconductor  system design segment 

this segment is comprised of the following 



software integrity segment 

 most of our customer arrangements involve hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience fluctuations in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip product sales consulting projects flexible spending account fsa drawdowns royalties and hardware sales as revenue from ip products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront customer demand and timing requirements for such ip products and hardware have resulted in increased variability of our total revenue 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to the continued organic growth of the business in timebased and upfront ip license products and higher maintenance and service revenue 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the continued business growth in all product categories and higher revenue of 1025 million recognized under new revenue standard asc 606 compared with revenue recognized under old revenue standard asc 605 the increase was partially offset by approximately 460 million of additional revenue due to one extra week in fiscal 2018 

for a discussion of revenue by geographic areas see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

timebased products revenue 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

the decrease in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the impact of lower revenue recognized under asc 606 of 2069 million offset by an increase in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

upfront products revenue 

changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers and higher ip revenue recognized upfront under asc 606 of 2354 million  

upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of ip products and hardware sales such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer requirements 

maintenance and service revenue 

maintenance revenue for fiscal 2020 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the volume and type of arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue under asc 606 of 740 million and an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of ip consulting projects and the timing of ip consulting projects  

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the timing of ip consulting projects the increase was offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stockbased compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization changes in hardware related direct costs and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our overall growth and fixed charges including information technology it and facilities 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019  or fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018  see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of products revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of products revenue cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed hardware related direct costs allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates we expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increases of 256 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring and acquisitions 161 

million in consulting costs primarily related to servicing ip consulting arrangements 51 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses and 28 million in hardware related direct costs partially offset by a decrease of 71 million in amortization of intangible assets 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase of 215 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring 113 million in consulting costs primarily related to servicing ip consulting arrangements 101 million in it and facility expenses and 53 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses partially offset by a decrease of 244 million in amortization of intangible assets and one additional week of expenses of approximately 45 million in fiscal 2018 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 

the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increases of 1245 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions 148 million in facility expenses and 66 million in consultants and contractor costs partially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses of 45 million  

the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of 415 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including organic hiring and those from prior year acquisitions 228 million in it and facility expenses and 55 million in consultants and contractor costs partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 193 million in fiscal 2018 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease of 195 million that included reduced travel and marketing expenses as a result of covid19 restrictions partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs of 191 million 

the increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of 113 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases and 43 million in it and facility expenses partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 58 million in fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2019 commission expenses were 41 million lower compared to commission expenses for fiscal 2018 which was accounted for under asc 605 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase of 242 million in personnelrelated expenses a legal settlement of 183 million in our favor in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and an increase of 131 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses partially offset by a decrease of 16 million in professional service costs 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a 260 million litigation settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 a legal settlement of 183 million in our favor in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and an additional week of expenses of approximately 41 million in fiscal 2018 the decreases were partially offset by a 71 million increase in personnelrelated costs 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no impact to our net income from the fair value changes in our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2020  

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2019 

restructuring charges 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 our management approved committed and initiated a restructuring plan the plan as part of a business reorganization total charges under the plan consisted primarily of severance termination and retirement benefits under the 2019 voluntary retirement program vrp 

the following is a summary of our restructuring activities 

see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information  

other income expense net 

the net decrease in other income expense for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to changes in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets partially offset by lower interest expenses due to a lower debt balance 

the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was also primarily due to changes in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

segment operating results 

we do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments these unallocated expenses consist primarily of stockbased compensation expense amortization of intangible assets restructuring litigation and acquisitionrelated costs see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

semiconductor  system design segment 



the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue recognized under asc 606 of 975 million and an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods partially offset by approximately 120 million due to an additional week of operating income in fiscal 2018 

software integrity segment 

the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods and the impact of higher revenue recognized under asc 606 of 50 million 

income taxes 

the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective on january 1 2018 beginning in fiscal 2019 our annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 40 which included a tax benefit of 392 million of us federal research tax credit a foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction of 243 million and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 723 million 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 24 which included a tax benefit of 281 million related to the realizability of us foreign tax credits related to the transfer of intangibles associated with the tax restructuring in fiscal 2018 a us federal research tax credit of 345 million a fdii deduction of 266 million and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 405 million 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 190 which included a tax benefit of 1720 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights a us federal research tax credit of 351 million a tax benefit of 281 million arising from a settlement with the internal revenue service irs in fiscal 2017 and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 310 million these benefits were partially offset by tax expense of 631 million for a onetime transition tax on foreign earnings 511 million due to remeasurement of us deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of 279 million 

the integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among companycontrolled entities these intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a companycontrolled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition 

the tax act required us to pay a onetime transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining earnings in fiscal 2018 we recorded a tax expense of 631 million based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 including altera corp et al v commissioner and the hungarian administrative court ruling we recorded a tax benefit of 179 million related to the onetime transition tax see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the tax act includes certain new tax provisions listed below which apply to us beginning in fiscal 2019 



the tax act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31 2017 that were not subject to the onetime transition tax we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority the hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million we paid the tax assessments penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet on april 30 2019 the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the courts decision we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of 174 million which is net of estimated us foreign tax credits for the tax assessments the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on november 12 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the hungarian administrative court for further proceedings we expect to receive the hungarian supreme court’s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes the impacts related to the tax act and the hungarian audit  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 

we have considered the potential impact of the covid19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources although we have not observed any material effects on our liquidity collections from customers or other working capital requirements due to the covid19 pandemic to date there is substantial uncertainty that could result in greater variability as additional events and information become known we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital asset purchases share repurchases acquisitions debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations  we are continuously evaluating the covid19 pandemic’s effects and taking steps to mitigate known risks including potential constraints on our liquidity and capital resources as a result of customers’ reduced expenditures or disruptions to our supply chain in light of that ongoing assessment we may choose to temporarily defer certain expenditures due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

as of october 31 2020  we held an aggregate of 5900 million in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of 6457 million in our foreign subsidiaries the tax act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31 2017 that were not subject to the onetime transition tax we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

the following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2020  

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities the increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by stock repurchases repayment of debt cash used for acquisition and purchases of property and equipment 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased products revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income higher cash collections and lower disbursements in operations including timing of vendor payments and other employee related expenses 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and higher cash collections partially offset by higher disbursements for operations including vendor payments 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions of 1644 million 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2018 of 6160 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower debt repayments of 2352 million and higher proceeds of 836 million from credit facilities drawdowns 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 cash used in financing activities was higher primarily due to higher debt repayments of 2288 million and lower proceeds from credit facilities drawdowns of 4277 million 

accounts receivable net 

changes in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by the timing and volume of customer billing and collection activities 

working capital 

working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 



increases in our working capital were primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 5071 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 2268 million  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of 1758 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 1172 million  we did not see a significant impact on our working capital during this period from the covid19 pandemic 

other commitments — credit and term loan facilities 

as of october 31 2020  we had 1021 million outstanding balance net of debt issuance costs under the term loan of which 750 million was classified as longterm liabilities outstanding principal payments under the term loan are due as follows 

as of october 31 2019  we had a 1198 million outstanding balance net of debt issuance costs under the term loan of which 1022 million was classified as longterm liabilities 

there was no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31 2020 and october 31 2019  we expect our borrowings under the revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 

our term loan and revolver borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement as of october 31 2020  borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor 1125 and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor 1000  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0125 and 0200 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

in july 2018 we entered into a 12year 2200 million rmb approximately 330 million credit agreement with a lender in china to support our facilities expansion borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5 year loan prime rate plus 074 as of october 31 2020  we had 258 million outstanding under the agreement 

see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other 

as of october 31 2020  our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 

we proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see notes 6 and 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and available credit under our revolver will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations as of october 31 2020 are as follows 

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2020  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents and outstanding debt as of october 31 2020  all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable or fixed interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of october 31 2020 are as follows 

foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months  see note 2 and note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts  

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2020  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 76 million and we would be required to pay approximately 76 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in positive cash flow of approximately 76 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized gain of approximately 34 million and net unrealized loss of 45 million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2020 and 2019  respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2020 was as follows 



equity risk we had approximately 132 million and 110 million of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2020 and 2019  respectively the investments that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted using the measurement alternative when the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable securities accounted for as equity method investments are recorded at cost plus the proportional share of the issuers’ income or loss which is recorded in the other income expense net investments are written down to the fair value when an event or circumstance which impacts the fair value of these investments indicates that the investments are impaired and the fair value of the investments is less than the carrying value none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of “smart” devices numerous software applications apps have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices the increasing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors transistors are the basic building blocks for ics each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production 

the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and lower power consumption our customers are the designers of those products and are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products in shorter timeframes and at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products 

“better” “sooner” and “cheaper” than competitors the designs of these chips and systems are extremely complex and necessitate stateoftheart design solutions 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software arena whether embedded on a chip or as a standalone the pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly frequent release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices it is crucial to have highquality secure code to ensure consumers’ privacy and safety 

our role—the silicon to software ™ partner 

synopsys products and services enable innovators across a variety of markets—from mobile electronics and finance to media medical energy industrial and automotive—to develop smart and secure products and applications across all industries our customers face tremendous pressure to build differentiated chips and develop robust code more quickly and costeffectively than ever before with the increasing amount of embedded software in today’s devices security and quality are top concerns synopsys technologies and services are designed to help our customers — both hardware designers and software developers — to speed time to market achieve the highest quality of results mitigate risk and maximize profitability our offerings span from silicon to software  

the task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to design locate and connect the building blocks of chips and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this task is a complex multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual ics and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are readytouse in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

the task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developers goal as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of defects we offer products that can help developers write higher quality more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner to the extent that developers make use of open source software in their code our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they are less costly to fix

information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  risks related to our foreign operations are described in part i item 1a risk factors  

performance obligations and backlog 

we adopted the accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 this revenue standard requires disclosure of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations contracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately 44 billion as of october 31 2019 of which 4943 million were in noncancellable commitments from customers who will determine specific products or services selections at a later date the remaining performance obligations excluding the noncancellable commitments were 39 billion of which 56 are expected to be fulfilled and recognized over the next 12 months 

our historical backlog was 40 billion as of october 31 2018 primarily representing three years of committed orders which included noncancellable commitments with future deliverables 

revenue attributable to product categories and segments 

beginning in fiscal 2019 we report under two segments semiconductor  system design segment and software integrity segment revenue attributable to each of our four product categories with eda ip  systems integration and other comprising our semiconductor  system design segment is shown below as a percentage of our total revenue for those fiscal years 

aggregate revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries through multiple agreements accounted for 128  154 and 179 of our total revenue in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively in each such year the revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries was primarily attributable to our semiconductor  system design segment no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during such periods 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of licenses to our eda products are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks the majority of licenses to our software integrity products are capacity or user licenses that allow a number of users to access the software based on a specified number of team members or specified codebases in a defined territory license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in a number of cases regarding our eda products we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend placeandroute software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps ensure our eda customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design their product offering remix rights to eda customers gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of eda products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time—because in such cases the customer does not need to obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional eda products—the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

for a full discussion of our software product offerings see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we typically license our designware ip products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties royalty arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

our hardware products which principally consist of our prototyping and emulation systems are either sold or leased to our customers our professional services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms price and payment terms postcontract customer support flexibility of tool use and interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products we also deliver a significant amount of engineering and design consulting for our products no single factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation now part of siemens ag we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities 

our semiconductor  system design segment competes against numerous other ip providers including cadence design systems inc and our customers internally developed ip we generally compete on the basis of product quality reliability and features ease of integration with customer designs compatibility with design tools license terms price and payment terms and customer support 

our software integrity segment competes with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies for example competitors named in the gartner magic quadrant for application security testing include checkmarx ltd veracode now part of thoma bravo llc and micro focus international plc 

proprietary rights 

we primarily rely upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 3200 united states and foreign patents issued and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future our issued patents have expiration dates through 2039  our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may independently develop similar technology in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries while protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these thirdparty rights we license software and other intellectual property from third parties including in several instances for inclusion in our products risks related to our use of thirdparty technology are described in part i item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the electronic design automation eda industry as a whole our semiconductor  system design segment product sales and to some extent our software integrity segment product sales is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers systems companies and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips integrated circuits electronic systems and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls additionally as the eda industry has matured consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services furthermore we depend on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenue reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio additional support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us we have also continually expanded our nonus operations this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 

furthermore if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

as our business volume increases in the asia pacific region there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries and the united states that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes export restrictions and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption export restriction or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers increase the cost of our products and services have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending make our products less competitive or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits our customers and suppliers’ businesses and our results of operations 

for example beginning in may 2019 the united states government placed certain entities on the “entity list” restricting the sale of us technologies to the named entities as a result of this government action we are not able to book new business with these entities and revenue associated with these entities is put “on hold” until either the contract expires or the restriction is lifted in response to that action or similar actions taken by the united states other countries may adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business in addition government or customer efforts attitudes laws or policies regarding technology independence may lead to nonus customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products which would also have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly in addition there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statements of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies including the renminbi or yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the global economy has been relatively strong in recent years there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of economic recovery in many regions uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us such caution by customers could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts 

we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry the banking and financial services industry and the economy could affect our business in addition economic conditions could deteriorate in the future and in particular the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow including as the result of any disruption of international trade relationships in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 



the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include 

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete and our business and financial condition may be harmed 

in our semiconductor  system design segment we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation now part of siemens ag we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers internally developed ip 

in our software integrity segment we compete with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 



multiple tool copies postcontract customer support “remix” rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products and the ability to purchase pools of technology 

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information 

for example we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system in 2015 we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system while we identified and closed the method used to gain access it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and such a breach could harm our business and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards a breach may still occur any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

our software products including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information and other destructive outcomes as a result our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we offer software security and quality testing solutions if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services and could result in a loss of customers or sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure successful attacks could damage our reputation as a securityfocused company 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and other thirdparties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 



 if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including software security and quality testing solutions although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services and our efforts in this area may not be successful our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 

 

difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors including those resulting from thirdparty suppliers could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

our hardware products which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems subject us to distinct risks 

the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks including 

 changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 

the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics including for example revenue recognition and accounting for leases for information regarding new accounting standards please refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading effect of new accounting pronouncements these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results for example the new revenue recognition standard became applicable to us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and there is an increased volatility in our total revenue with less predictability than the prior accounting standard 

our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations changes in our geographical earnings mix unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates future changes to our tax structure or by evolving enforcement practices 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which significantly changed prior us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business the tax act includes certain new provisions that began to affect our income from foreign operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the applicability and impact of these new tax provisions is dependent in part on changes to our tax structure that were implemented in response to the tax act at the end of fiscal 2018 the net impact of such changes is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years since the beginning of fiscal 2019 the us treasury department has issued proposed regulations that if finalized as written would have a material impact on our ability to claim certain tax benefits related to the tax act while the company continues to evaluate the potential impact on its estimated annual tax rate certain of these regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change as additional regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may materially differ from previous estimates and those differences may materially affect our financial position accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may materially differ from previous estimates and those differences may materially affect our financial position 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd which represents a coalition of member countries on october 5 2015 the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years 

our income and nonincome tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations if any under the tax act although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million we paid the tax assessments penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet on april 30 2019 the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 for further discussion of the hungary audit see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading nonus examinations 

we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits how such credits are treated under provisions of the tax act changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2019  approximately 74 of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries we intend to meet our us cash spending needs including the tax act provisional transition tax primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

for example we were engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums in june 2018 we settled all outstanding patent litigation with mentor for a 650 million payment made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to siemens which acquired mentor in march 2017 further information regarding the lawsuits and settlement are contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “legal proceedings” in conjunction with the settlement we also amended an existing interoperability agreement with mentor to collaborate on a wide range of eda products the amendment includes a onetime termination charge between 00 and 250 million payable to mentor under certain conditions in the event such conditions are met the termination charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment customer supplier competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to these thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert managements attention 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join us in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations including conflict minerals regulations affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets 

from time to time our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions valuation allowances on deferred tax assets allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

our principal offices are located in two adjacent buildings in mountain view california which together provide approximately 341000 square feet of available space this space is leased through august 2030 and we have two options to extend the lease term the first to extend the term by ten years followed by a second option to extend by approximately nine additional years we also lease approximately 238000 square feet of space in three separate buildings in sunnyvale california with lease expirations ranging from december 2019 through june 2020 

additionally we own one building in sunnyvale california with approximately 120000 square feet of space that will be vacated and leased to a third party in 2020 under a lease agreement that runs through february 2031 we will vacate these four sunnyvale buildings between november 2019 and february 2020 and move into three separate buildings comprising approximately 350000 square feet of space in sunnyvale california which we have leased through october 2031 these buildings in mountain view and sunnyvale are used for research and development sales and support marketing and administrative activities for both of our business segments  

we currently lease 31 other offices throughout the united states and own two office buildings in oregon one of which is leased to a tenant these offices are used primarily for sales and support activities as well as research and development for both of our business segments 

international facilities 

we lease additional space for sales service and research and development activities for both of our business segments in approximately 29 countries throughout the world including 25000 square feet in dublin ireland for our international headquarters as well as significant sites in yerevan armenia bangalore india shanghai and wuhan in addition we own two buildings in hsinchu with approximately 212000 square feet of combined space 

we believe that our existing facilities including both owned and leased properties are in good condition and suitable for the current conduct of our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase decrease or be eliminated 

mentor patent litigation 

prior to the legal settlement as further described below we were engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums we succeeded to the litigation when we acquired emulation  verification engineering sa on october 4 2012 

legal settlement 

in march 2017 siemens plm software siemens acquired mentor on june 29 2018 synopsys siemens and mentor settled all outstanding patent litigation between synopsys and mentor for a 650 million payment made in the third quarter from synopsys to mentor synopsys had previously accrued 390 million and recorded the remaining 260 million as an expense in the quarter ended july 31 2018 as a result of the settlement the litigation with mentor was dismissed and the injunction entered in connection with that litigation was vacated 

the settlement included mutual sevenyear patent crosslicenses between synopsys and siemens and between synopsys and mentor synopsys and mentor also amended an existing interoperability agreement to collaborate on a wide range of eda products for the benefit of their mutual customers the amendment includes a onetime termination charge between 00 and 250 million payable to mentor under certain conditions 

other proceedings 

in july 2017 the hta issued a final assessment against synopsys hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has disallowed synopsys hungarys tax positions taken during these years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 445 million and interest and penalties of 180 million on august 2 2017 synopsys hungary filed a claim contesting the final assessment with the hungarian administrative court on november 16 2017 synopsys hungary paid the assessment as required by law while continuing its challenge to the assessment in court hearings were held in february and july 2018 february 26 2019 and april 30 2019 on december 10 2018 synopsys withdrew its claim contesting the final assessment with regard to the timing of the deduction of research expenses resulting in a remaining disputed tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million on april 30 2019 the hungarian administrative court court ruled against synopsys hungary the courts opinion was received on may 16 2019 synopsys hungary filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the courts decision the company recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of 174 million which is net of estimated us foreign tax credits for the tax assessments

tableend

overview 

the following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in item 8 of this form 10k please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys inc provides products and services used across the entire silicon to software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits ics also known as chips we also offer semiconductor intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves we provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them to complement these offerings we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems these products and services are part of our semiconductor  system design segment 

we are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services media automotive medicine energy and industrials these tools and services are part of our software integrity segment 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets and our customers spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 

our software integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code  while it is being written  for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance our software integrity customers are software developers across many industries including but also well beyond the semiconductor and systems industries our software integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain 

despite global economic uncertainty we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005 we achieved these results because of our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships we recognize our revenue for the software licenses over the arrangement period which typically approximates three years for discussion on our revenue recognition policy please see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements timebased revenue consists of timebased products maintenance and service revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period as a result decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings and driving growth in the software security and quality market as we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market for instance in the software security and quality space and as hardware product sales grow we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue in addition due to our adoption of accounting standard codification 606 asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers in the beginning of fiscal 2019 as further described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements has increased the variability in our total revenue from period to period nevertheless the accounting impact has not affected our cash generated from our business based on our leading technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully 

business segments 

effective in fiscal 2019 we realigned our business to evaluate the results of our software integrity business separately from our traditional eda and semiconductor ip business the chief operating decision makers codms now regularly review disaggregated information for the following two reportable segments 1 semiconductor  system design which includes eda tools ip products system integration solutions and other revenue categories and 2 software integrity which includes a comprehensive solution for building integrity—security quality and compliance testing—into our customers’ software development lifecycle and supply chain our historical results have been recast to retrospectively reflect the change from one to two reportable segments 

as a result of the change in reporting structure financial information provided to and used by the codms to assist in making operational decisions allocating resources and assessing performance reflects consolidated financial information as well as revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin for the semiconductor  system design and software integrity segments accompanied by disaggregated information relating to revenues by geographic region 

semiconductor  system design this segment includes our advanced silicon design verification products and services and semiconductor ip portfolio which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries eda includes digital custom ic design and field programmable gate array fpga design software verification products and manufacturing software products designers use these products to automate the ic design process and to reduce errors for ip we are a leading provider of highquality siliconproven ip solutions for systemonchips socs this includes ip that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile automotive digital home internet of things and cloud computing markets enabling designers to quickly develop socs in these areas

fiscal 2019 financial performance summary 

we adopted new revenue guidance asc 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense the comparative information for periods prior to fiscal 2019 has not been restated additional comparative information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the adoption of asc 606 and our proforma financial results under accounting standards codification 605 asc 605 revenue recognition for fiscal 2019 

in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  our financial performance reflects the following 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our significant accounting policies 

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment we have concluded that our eda software licenses in tsl contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term because those promises represent inputs to a single combined performance obligation where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses updates and technical support because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same timebased pattern of transfer to the customer in reaching this conclusion we considered the nature of our obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software as eda customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to the customers’ ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities in addition we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations we believe such estimates to be reasonable however the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

effect of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

we adopted new revenue guidance asc 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense the comparative information for periods prior to the fiscal 2019 has not been restated additional comparative information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the adoption of asc 606 and our proforma financial results under asc 605 for fiscal 2019 

revenue 

our revenues are generated from two business segments the semiconductor  system design segment and the software integrity segment see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions 

further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows 

semiconductor  system design segment 

this segment is comprised of the following 



includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software which includes rights to technical support hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same timebased pattern of transfer to the customer the portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of delivery because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time we have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has title to the hardware physical possession and a present obligation to pay for the hardware the portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term the adoption of asc 606 did not change the timing of revenue recognition for hardware products 

 software integrity segment 

 most of our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals as well as payment terms for revenue recognized under asc 605 for example we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip consulting projects royalties variability in ip products sales and hardware sales as revenue from ip products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront customer demand and timing requirements for such ip products and hardware have resulted in increased variability of our total revenue 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the continued business growth in all product categories and higher revenue of 1025 million recognized under new revenue standard asc 606 compared with revenue recognized under old revenue standard asc 605 the increase was partially offset by approximately 460 million of additional revenue due to one extra week in fiscal 2018 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the continued overall growth of our business mainly due to higher tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods an increase in professional services additional revenue of approximately 460 million due to an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and contributions from acquired companies 

for a discussion of revenue by geographic areas see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

timebased products revenue 

the decrease in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the impact of lower revenue recognized under asc 606 of 2069 million offset by an increase in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods including contributions from acquired companies and additional revenue due to an extra week in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

upfront products revenue 

changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers and higher ip revenue recognized upfront under asc 606 of 2354 million  

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers 

upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of ip products and hardware sales such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer requirements 

maintenance and service revenue 

the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue under asc 606 of 740 million and an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the timing of ip consulting projects the increase was offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in consulting projects including contributions from acquisitions and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stockbased compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our overall growth and fixed charges including information technology it and facilities 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018  or fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017  see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of products revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of products revenue cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates we expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase of 215 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring 113 million in consulting costs primarily related to servicing ip consulting arrangements 101 million in it and facility expenses and 53 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses partially offset by a decrease of 244 million in amortization of intangible assets and one additional week of expenses of approximately 45 million in fiscal 2018 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of 477 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions an increase of 113 million in costs related to servicing ip consulting arrangements and an increase of 79 million in amortization of intangible assets as well as one additional week of expenses of approximately 45 million in fiscal 2018 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 

the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of 415 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including organic hiring and those from prior year acquisitions 228 million in it and facility expenses and 55 million in consultants and contractor costs partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 193 million in fiscal 2018 

the increase in research and development expense for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of 1144 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions and one additional week of expenses of approximately 193 million in fiscal 2018 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 

the increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of 113 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases and 43 million in it and facility expenses partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 58 million in fiscal 2018 

for fiscal 2019 commission expenses were 41 million lower compared to commission expenses under asc 605 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase of 510 million in personnel costs as a result of headcount increases an increase of 75 million due to timing of marketing events and one additional week of expenses of approximately 58 million in fiscal 2018 

general and administrative 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a 260 million litigation settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 a legal settlement of 183 million in our favor in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and an additional week of expenses of approximately 41 million in fiscal 2018 the decreases were partially offset by a 71 million increase in personnelrelated costs 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of 215 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases an increase of 221 million in professional service costs primarily due to additional legal accounting and tax services related to various projects an increase of 182 million in net litigation settlement costs primarily due to a 260 million litigation settlement recorded in fiscal 2018 compared with 76 million net litigation charges recorded in fiscal 2017 an increase of 110 million in facilities expenses and one additional week of expenses of approximately 41 million in fiscal 2018 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2019 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the additions of acquired intangible assets partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized 

restructuring charges 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 our management approved committed and initiated a restructuring plan the plan as part of a business reorganization total charges under the plan are expected to be 56 million to 65 million and consist primarily of severance termination and retirement benefits under the 2019 voluntary retirement program vrp restructuring charges under the plan are anticipated to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2020 

the following is a summary of our restructuring activities 

see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information  

other income expense net 

the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and higher interest expense due to a higher debt balance 

segment operating results 

we do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments these unallocated expenses consist primarily of stockbased compensation expense amortization of intangible assets restructuring litigation and acquisitionrelated costs see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

semiconductor  system design segment 



the increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue recognized under asc 606 of 975 million and an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods partially offset by approximately 120 million due to an additional week of operating income in fiscal 2018

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 190 which included a tax benefit of 1720 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights a us federal research tax credit of 351 million a settlement with the internal revenue service irs of 218 million tax benefit for fiscal 2017 and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 310 million these benefits were partially offset by tax expense of 631 million for a onetime transition tax on foreign earnings 511 million due to remeasurement of us deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of 279 million 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 644 which included income tax expense of 1662 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of 825 million 305 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets a settlement with the korean national tax service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of 79 million and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of 364 million these expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 381 million a us federal research tax credit of 255 million and a settlement with the taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of 109 million 

the integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among companycontrolled entities these intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a companycontrolled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition 

the tax act required us to pay a onetime transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining earnings in fiscal 2018 we recorded a tax expense of 631 million based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 including altera corp et al v commissioner and the hungarian administrative court ruling we recorded a tax benefit of 179 million related to the onetime transition tax see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements or further discussion 

we continue to obtain analyze and interpret additional guidance issued related to the tax act the applicability and impact of the following new tax provisions are dependent in part on forthcoming irs guidance 

 the tax act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31 2017 that were not subject to the onetime transition tax we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority the hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 250 million and interest and penalties of 110 million we paid the tax assessments penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet on april 30 2019 the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5 2019 

see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes the impacts related to the tax act and the hungarian audit  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 

as of october 31 2019  we held an aggregate of 1916 million in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of 5370 million in our foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act if we decide to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the us in the future the earnings made after december 31 2017 would not be subject to further us tax in addition we have provided foreign deferred taxes on our undistributed earnings of 63 million in fiscal 2019 which is sufficient to address the incremental tax that would be due on future foreign earnings 

the following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2019  

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities the increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by repayment of debt stock repurchases annual variable compensation payouts and purchases of property and equipment 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased products revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and higher cash collections partially offset by higher disbursements for operations including vendors 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher vendor disbursements higher income taxes payment higher accounts receivable due to timing of customer billings and higher inventory disbursements in fiscal 2018 included certain onetime payments of 1633 million for income taxes and 650 million for a litigation settlement 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2018 of 6160 million  

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions of 3934 million and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases of 1281 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 cash used in financing activities was higher primarily due to higher debt repayments of 2288 million and lower proceeds from credit facilities drawdowns of 4277 million  

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 cash provided by financing activities was higher primarily due to higher proceeds of 3006 million from drawdowns of our credit facilities and lower debt repayment of 853 million 

accounts receivable net 

changes in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by the timing of customer billing and collection activities 

working capital 

working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 



increases in our working capital were primarily due to a decrease in shortterm debt of 3262 million  an increase in prepaid and other current assets of 2225 million  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 719 million  partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 55 million  

other commitments — credit and term loan facilities 

in july 2018 we entered into a 2200 million rmb approximately 330 million credit agreement with a lender in china to support our facilities expansion borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the chinese central bank rate plus 10 of such rate as of october 31 2019  we had 179 million outstanding under the agreement 

on november 28 2016 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders the credit agreement providing for i a 6500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan the credit agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated may 19 2015 in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from 5000 million to 6500 million  provide a new 1500 million senior unsecured term loan facility and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from may 19 2020 to november 28 2021 subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million  the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio as well as other nonfinancial covenants as of october 31 2019  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 

as of october 31 2019  we had 1198 million outstanding balance net of debt issuance costs under the term loan of which 1022 million was classified as longterm liabilities outstanding principal payments under the term loan are due as follows 

as of october 31 2018  we had 1338 million outstanding balance net of debt issuance costs under the term loan of which 1200 million was classified as longterm liabilities the total outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31 2018 was 3300 million  which was included in shortterm liabilities 

there was no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31 2019  we expect our borrowings under the revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement as of october 31 2019  borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor 1125 and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor 1000  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0125 and 0200 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

subsequent to fiscal year 2019 we drew down 1600 million under the revolver the total outstanding balance of the revolver as of december 20 2019 is 1600 million  net of repayments 

other 

as of october 31 2019  our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 

we proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage 

credit rating exceeding aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see notes 5 and 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and available credit under our revolver will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations as of october 31 2019 are as follows 

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2019  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents and outstanding debt as of october 31 2019  all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable and fixed interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of october 31 2019 are as follows 

foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months  see note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts  

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2019  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 104 million  and we would be required to pay approximately 104 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 104 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized loss of approximately 45 million and 239 million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2019 was as follows 



equity risk we have approximately 110 million and 109 million of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2019 and 2018  respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value we did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2019 and 2018 none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of “smart” devices numerous software applications apps have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices the increasing viability of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip design companies around the world 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors transistors are the basic building blocks for ics each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production 

the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and lower power consumption our customers are the designers of those products and are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products in shorter timeframes and at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” than competitors the designs of these chips and systems are extremely complex and necessitate stateoftheart design solutions 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software arena where the pace of innovation often requires developers—also our customers—to deliver more secure highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly frequent release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is prevalent in many industries across a growing array of smart devices it is crucial to have highquality secure code to ensure consumers’ privacy and safety 

our role—the silicon to software ™  partner 

synopsys products and services enable innovators across a variety of markets—from mobile electronics and finance to media medical energy industrial and automotive—to develop smart and secure products and applications across all industries our customers face tremendous pressure to build differentiated chips and develop robust code more quickly and costeffectively than ever before with the increasing amount of embedded software in today’s devices security and quality are top concerns synopsys technologies and services are designed to help our customers — both hardware designers and software developers — to speed time to market achieve the highest quality of results mitigate risk and maximize profitability our offerings span from silicon to software  

the task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to design locate and connect the building blocks of chips and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this task is a complex multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual ics and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are readytouse in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

the task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developers goal as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of defects we offer products that can help developers write higher quality more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner to the extent that developers make use of open source software in their code our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they are less costly to fix

our backlog was approximately 40 billion  on october 31 2018  an increase from backlog of 37 billion  on october 31 2017  resulting primarily from the timing of large multiyear contract renewals backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years we currently expect that 17 billion  of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2019  backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

revenue attributable to each of our four product categories is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

aggregate revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries through multiple agreements accounted for 154  179  and 159  of our total revenue in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during such periods 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in a number of cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend placeandroute software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps ensure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design their product offering remix rights to customers gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time—because in such cases the customer does not need to obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products—the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under primarily two license types tsls and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these types of licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates  and results of operations—revenue background  

we typically license our designware ip products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties royalty arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

our hardware products which principally consist of our prototyping and emulation systems are either sold or leased to our customers our professional services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms price and payment terms postcontract customer support flexibility of tool use and interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products we also deliver a significant amount of engineering and design consulting for our products no single factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation now part of siemens ag we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities 

in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers including cadence design systems inc and our customers internally developed ip we generally compete on the basis of product quality reliability and features ease of integration with customer designs compatibility with design tools license terms price and payment terms and customer support 

in the area of software integrity solutions we compete with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies for example competitors named in the gartner magic quadrant for application security testing include checkmarx ltd international business machines corporation micro focus international plc and veracode acquired by thoma bravo llc 

proprietary rights 

we primarily rely upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 3100  united states and foreign patents issued and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future our issued patents have expiration dates through 2037  our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may independently develop similar technology in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries while protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these thirdparty rights we license software and other intellectual property from third parties including in several instances for inclusion in our products risks related to our use of thirdparty technology are described in part i item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the electronic design automation eda industry as a whole our eda and intellectual property ip product sales and to some extent our software integrity solutions sales is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips and integrated circuits and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls additionally as the eda industry matures consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services furthermore we depend on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenue reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio additional support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the global economy has shown improvement in recent years there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us such caution by customers could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts 

we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the 

banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry the banking and financial services industry and the economy could affect our business in addition economic conditions could deteriorate in the future and in particular the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow including as the result of any disruption of international trade relationships in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

 the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include 



 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete and our business and financial condition may be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation now part of siemens ag we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products 

in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers internally developed ip in the area of software integrity solutions we compete with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half  of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us in addition we have continually expanded our nonus operations in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 

as our business volume increases in the asia pacific region there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries and the united states that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales make our products more expensive for customers which could make our products less competitive and reduce consumer demand adversely restrict or delay our suppliers of hardware components and products which could adversely impact our future revenues and financial results or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits our and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses and our results of operations furthermore if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

in response to us tariffs other countries may adopt tariffs and other trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services additionally political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could have a negative impact on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely impact our business operations 

in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly in addition there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies especially the japanese yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation 

exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information 

for example in october 2015 we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access which had begun in july 2015 to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system while we identified and closed the method used to gain access it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and such a breach could harm our business and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards a breach may still occur any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

our software products including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions may also be vulnerable to cyber attack an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information and other destructive outcomes as a result our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we offer software security and quality testing solutions if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attack or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services and could result in a loss of customers or sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure successful attacks could damage our reputation as a securityfocused company 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and other thirdparties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 



 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 

 if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including software security and quality solutions although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services and our efforts in this area may not be successful our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 

 

difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

our hardware products which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems subject us to distinct risks 

the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks including 



changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 

the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics including for example revenue recognition and accounting for leases for information regarding new accounting standards please refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements  under the heading effect of new accounting pronouncements   these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results for example the recent new revenue recognition standard will be applicable to us beginning in fiscal 2019 and could lead to increased volatility in our total revenue as some of our revenue may be recognized in different periods and with less predictability than is the case under current accounting standards 

our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations changes in our geographical earnings mix unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates future changes to our tax structure or by evolving enforcement practices 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which significantly changed prior us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business in the current year and future years accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may materially differ from previous estimates and those differences may materially affect our financial position in addition the tax act includes certain new provisions that will affect our income from foreign operations beginning in fiscal 2019 as well as a lower corporate tax rate on income from domestic operations because guidance continues to evolve however the net impact of these changes is uncertain and while we believe such changes will have an overall favorable impact on our effective tax rate certain interpretations of the international provisions of the tax act could adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years 

in fiscal 2018 we incurred foreign taxes of 677 million as a result of reorganizing certain rights related to use of our intellectual property in our international business such tax was recorded as a prepaid tax on our balance sheet in accordance with current accounting rules the amount of tax is subject to audit by the hungarian tax authority hta and could increase along with the imposition of penalties and interest and could materially affect our financial results and cash flow 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd which represents a coalition of member countries on october 5 2015 the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years 

our income and nonincome tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we are currently under examination by the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is 

uncertain for example we may be liable for additional withholding tax on payments made to us by customers in certain jurisdictions and we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations if any under the tax act although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made 

in july 2017 the hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has disallowed synopsys hungarys tax positions taken during those years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 445 million and interest and penalties of 180 million we paid the tax assessments penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet we continue to appeal the assessment through the hungarian administrative court if the assessment is ultimately canceled the hungarian statutory accounting treatment could have an indirect adverse impact on certain tax benefits in the year of the cancellation for further discussion of the hungary audit see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements  under the heading nonus examinations 

we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits how such credits are treated under provisions of the tax act changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2018  approximately 75 of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries we intend to meet our us cash spending needs including the tax act provisional transition tax primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

for example we were engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums in june 2018 we settled all outstanding patent litigation with mentor for a 650 million payment made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to siemens which previously acquired mentor in march 2017 further information regarding the lawsuits and settlement are contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  and note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements  under the heading “legal proceedings” in conjunction with the settlement we also amended an existing interoperability agreement with mentor to collaborate on a wide range of eda products the amendment includes a onetime termination charge between 00 and 250 million payable to mentor under certain conditions in the event such conditions are met the termination charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment customer supplier competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors including those resulting from thirdparty suppliers could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to these thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert managements attention 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join us in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations including conflict minerals regulations affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets 

from time to time our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions valuation allowances on deferred tax assets allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase decrease or be eliminated 

mentor patent litigation 

prior to the legal settlement as further described below we were engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums we succeeded to the litigation when we acquired emulation  verification engineering sa on october 4 2012 

legal settlement 

in march 2017 siemens plm software siemens acquired mentor on june 29 2018 synopsys siemens and mentor settled all outstanding patent litigation between synopsys and mentor for a 650 million payment made in the third quarter from synopsys to mentor synopsys had previously accrued 390 million and recorded the remaining 260 million as an expense in the quarter ended july 31 2018 as a result of the settlement the litigation with mentor was dismissed and the injunction entered in connection with that litigation was vacated 

the settlement included mutual sevenyear patent crosslicenses between synopsys and siemens and between synopsys and mentor synopsys and mentor also amended an existing interoperability agreement to collaborate on a wide range of eda products for the benefit of their mutual customers the amendment includes a onetime termination charge between 00 and 250 million payable to mentor under certain conditions 

other proceedings 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority hta issued a final assessment against synopsys hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has disallowed synopsys hungarys tax positions taken during these years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 445 million and interest and penalties of 180 million on august 2 2017 synopsys hungary filed a claim contesting the final assessment with the hungarian administrative court on november 16 2017 synopsys hungary paid the assessment as required by law while continuing its challenge to the assessment in court hearings were held in february and july 2018 and synopsys expects further hearings to be scheduled after the court’s expert submits an opinion relevant to the withholding tax issue in january 2019 on december 10 2018 synopsys withdrew its claim contesting the final assessment with regard to the timing of the deduction of research expenses

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10k please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys inc provides products and services used by designers across the entire silicon to software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits ics also known as chips we also offer semiconductor intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves we provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them to complement these offerings we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems we 

are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services media automotive medicine energy and industrials 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process their research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs in addition a number of consolidations have taken place in the semiconductor industry over the past several years while we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results the future impact of ongoing consolidation is uncertain for a discussion of potential risks please see the risk factor titled “consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results” in part i item 1a risk factors  

despite global economic uncertainty we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005 we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships but also because of our timebased revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years timebased revenue consists of timebased products maintenance and service revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period due to our business model decreases or increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings and driving growth in the software security and quality market as we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market for instance in the software security and quality space and as hardware product sales grow we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue in addition due to our adoption of topic 606 in fiscal 2019 as further described in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements  the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements will increase the variability in our total revenue from period to period nevertheless this accounting impact will not affect our cash generation or change the way we operate our business based on our leading technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully 

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year fiscal 2018  was a 53week year and ended on november 3 2018  fiscal 2017  and 2016  were 52week years ending on october 28 2017  and october 29 2016  respectively fiscal 2019  will be a 52week year 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to the closest calendar month end 

fiscal 2018  financial performance summary 

in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  our financial performance reflects the following 



compared to the benefit recorded for restructuring of foreign ip rights and a decrease in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in fiscal 2018 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 revenue recognition 

we generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses and to a lesser extent hardware products maintenance and services timebased products revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products and professional services fees upfront products revenue includes hardware revenue consisting of sales of field programmable gate array fpgabased emulation and prototyping products and perpetual software licenses 

most of our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights bundled with postcontract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide a complete endtoend solution to the customer throughout the contract our customers are typically using a myriad of products to complete each phase of a chip design and are concurrently working on multiple chip designs or projects in different phases of the design during this time the customer looks to us to release stateoftheart technology as we keep up with the pace of change to address requested enhancements to our tools to meet customer specifications to provide support at each stage of the customer’s design including the final manufacturing of the chip the tapeout stage and other important services 

with respect to software licenses we primarily utilize two license types 

 for the two software license types we recognize revenue as follows 



the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations for perpetual licenses in which less than 75 of the license fee and 100 of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable such revenue is reported as “timebased products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products and professional services fees we recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customers as needed revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

hardware revenue consists of sales of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products we recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events such as royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs such revenue is reported as “timebased products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations these arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

we infrequently enter into multipleelement arrangements that contain both software and nonsoftware deliverables such as hardware we have determined that the software and nonsoftware deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting we recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type tsl or perpetual license such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and softwarerelated deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer with respect to tsl arrangements due to the complexity of the tools the complexity of the arrangement terms and intertwined services the license maintenance and other services are not separable and are considered as a combined unit additionally we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate the fee between these services therefore we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

revenue recognition involves certain judgments specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 



purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard enduser license arrangement or purchase agreement 

 valuation of business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets liabilities including contingencies assumed and intangible assets acquired in a business combination any excess fair value of purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make estimates and assumptions based in part on our judgments in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets our estimates and assumptions may include but are not limited to future cash flows of an acquired business other assumptions and the appropriate discount rate these estimates are inherently difficult subjective and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the fair value allocation to the acquired intangible assets could be different therefore our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets can have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets require assumptions judgments and estimates we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies in fiscal 2018 we also considered the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 3974 million which are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2018 based on current tax law will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset or a valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period that such determination is made 

uncertain tax positions are recorded by applying a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement an uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses maintenance and services and to a lesser extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times 



our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our timebased products upfront products and maintenance and services revenues for the period we derive timebased products revenue largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent from contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront products revenue directly from perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period we derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software and not when they are booked 

our revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters conversely a 120000 order for perpetual licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees and 100 of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

most of our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

the overall growth of our business including contributions from acquisitions has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip consulting projects royalties and variability in hardware sales and due to certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due as revenue from hardware sales is recognized upfront customer demand and timing requirements for such hardware may result in increased variability of our total revenue 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business mainly due to higher tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods an increase in professional services additional revenue of approximately 460 million due to an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and contributions from acquired companies 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business mainly due to higher tsl revenues hardware sales and ip consulting projects and to a lesser extent due to revenue from acquired companies 

for a discussion of revenue by geographic areas see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

timebased products revenue 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods including contributions from acquired companies and additional revenue due to an extra week in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods 

upfront products revenue 

changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products driven by timing of customer requirements 

upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate modestly based on the timing of ip products and hardware sales such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer requirements 

maintenance and service revenue 

the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to an increase in consulting projects including contributions from acquisitions and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to an increase in and the timing of ip consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method and contributions from acquisitions 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stockbased compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our overall growth including those from acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities as well as higher product costs due to increased hardware sales we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  or fiscal 2017   as compared to fiscal 2016  see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of products revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of products revenue  cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates we expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue 

amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to an increase of 477 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions an increase of 113 million in costs related to servicing ip consulting arrangements and an increase of 79 million in amortization of intangible assets as well as one additional week of expenses of approximately 45 million 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to an increase of 624 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions an increase of 375 million in hardware product costs due to increases in and timing of shipments an increase of 248 million in costs related to servicing ip consulting arrangements and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 86 million the increases were partially offset by decreases of 260 million in amortization of intangible assets 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of 1144 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions and one additional week of expenses of approximately 193 million 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase of 474 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase of 510 million in personnel costs as a result of headcount increases an increase of 75 million due to timing of marketing events and one additional week of expenses of approximately 58 million 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase of 408 million in personnel costs as a result of higher headcount and higher variable compensation primarily based on timing of shipments 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of 215 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases an increase of 221 million in professional service costs primarily due to additional legal accounting and tax services related to various projects an increase of 182 million in net litigation settlement costs primarily due to a 260 million litigation settlement recorded in fiscal 2018 compared with 76 million net litigation charges recorded in fiscal 2017 an increase of 110 million in facilities expenses and one additional week of expenses of approximately 41 million 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase of 380 million for accrued loss contingencies as a result of litigation an increase of 188 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases and an increase of 55 million in facilities expenses partially offset by a 304 million gain as a result of a legal settlement 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 



the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the additions of acquired intangible assets partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized 

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets 

restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2018 we recorded 129 million of restructuring charges as part of a business realignment the restructuring actions were undertaken to position us for future growth reallocate resources to priority areas and to a lesser extent eliminate operational redundancy these charges consisted primarily of severance and benefits the remaining balance of 81 million is expected to be paid in fiscal 2019 

during fiscal 2017 we recorded 366 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary and voluntary employee termination actions the restructuring actions were undertaken to position us for future growth reallocate resources to priority areas and to a lesser extent eliminate operational redundancy these charges consisted primarily of severance and retirement benefits as of the end of fiscal 2018 there were no unpaid balances remaining of the 2017 restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2016 we recorded 96 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary employee terminations which was fully paid in fiscal 2017 

the following is a summary of our restructuring activities 



see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

other income expense net 



the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and higher interest expense due to a higher debt balance 

the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

income taxes 

the tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted on december 22 2017 lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective on january 1 2018 because our fiscal 2018 commenced on november 1 2017 the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate applicable to fiscal 2018 is a blended rate of 234 beginning in fiscal 2019 our annual statutory federal corporate tax rate will be 21 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 190 which included a tax benefit of 1720 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights a us federal research tax credit of 351 million a settlement with the internal revenue service irs of 218 million tax benefit for fiscal 2017 and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 310 million these benefits were partially offset by tax expense of 631 million for a onetime transition tax on foreign earnings 511 million due to remeasurement of us deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of 279 million 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 644 which included income tax expense of 1662 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of 825 million 305 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state 

deferred tax assets a settlement with the korean national tax service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of 79 million and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of 364 million these expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 381 million a us federal research tax credit of 255 million and a settlement with the taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of 109 million 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 190 which included tax benefits from a settlement with the irs of 207 million for fiscal 2015 and the permanent reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 371 million partially offset by tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of 375 million the impact of undistributed foreign earnings of 96 million and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of 140 million as a result of changes in the expected utilization of state tax credits the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2015 and the full year of fiscal 2016 which was recorded in fiscal 2016 

the integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among companycontrolled entities the income tax effect is generally recognized over five years these intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a companycontrolled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition 

during the year we made provisional estimates of the accounting impacts of certain provisions of the tax act in the fourth quarter as a result of further analyzes of certain aspects of the tax act we have finalized the following provisional estimates 

as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate we remeasured our deferred taxes resulting in a firstquarter provisional tax expense of 456 million based on the tax rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods in the fourth quarter we finalized our calculations resulting in a tax expense for fiscal 2018 of 511 million 

as part of the adoption of a new territorial tax system the tax act required us to pay a onetime transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining earnings as of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we had recorded a provisional transition tax expense of 734 million as well as a provisional income tax payable of 179 million in the fourth quarter we finalized our calculations resulting in a tax expense of 631 million and income tax payable of 89 million we intend to elect to pay the transition tax over a period of eight years as permitted by the tax act 

we continue to obtain analyze and interpret additional guidance issued related to the tax act the applicability and impact of the following new tax provisions are dependent in part on forthcoming irs guidance 

 as part of the adoption of a territorial tax system the tax act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31 2017 that were not subject to the onetime transition tax we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we made significant changes to our international tax structure by transferring intangible assets between certain foreign subsidiaries and changing the tax status of these subsidiaries for us tax purposes as a result we recorded a deferred tax benefit of 1720 million for the future us tax deduction related 

to these intangible assets we paid foreign income tax of 677 million associated with the gain recognized on certain of these transactions the tax liabilities associated with these transfers are treated as prepaid taxes a portion of these foreign taxes may result in a us foreign tax credit but the amount expected to be realized cannot be determined at this time the tax liabilities and benefits are subject to examination by us and foreign tax authorities in future years 

in fiscal 2018 we reevaluated our strategy and subsequently withdrew our contest concerning the hungary tax litigation related to one issue in the audit of fiscal years 2011 through 2013 and recorded a tax expense of 57 million 

for further discussion of the provision for income taxes impacts related to the tax act the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights and the hungary audit see note 11 of notes to condensed consolidated financial statement 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 

as of october 31 2018  we held an aggregate of 1776 million  in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of 5455 million  in our foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act we have recorded a tax liability for the transition tax on foreign earnings payable over eight years of 07 million and 82 million reflected as a shortterm and longterm liability respectively if we decide to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the us in the future the earnings that were subject to the transition tax would not be subject to further us tax in addition we have provided foreign deferred taxes on our undistributed earnings sufficient to address the incremental tax that would be due on future foreign earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we completed a restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights resulting in a onetime tax payment of 677 million which is included in current prepaid taxes 

the following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2018  

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to cash used for business combinations and asset acquisitions and stock repurchases under our accelerated stock repurchase agreements partially offset by cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased products revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher vendor disbursements higher income taxes payment higher accounts receivable due to timing of customer billings and higher inventory disbursements in fiscal 2018 included certain onetime payments of 1633 million for income taxes and 650 million for a litigation settlement 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections partially offset by higher disbursements for operations including vendors 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions of 3934 million and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases of 1281 million 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of 1991 million partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 1393 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 cash provided by financing activity in fiscal 2018 was higher compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher proceeds of 3006 million from drawdowns of our credit facilities and lower debt repayment of 853 million 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt repayments of 1956 million partially offset by higher proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 1350 million 

accounts receivable net 

changes in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by timing of customer billing collection activities and to a lesser extent customer receivables acquired through our acquisitions 

working capital   

working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 



decreases in our working capital were primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 3253 million an increase in short term debt of 3338 million an increase in deferred revenue of 883 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 785 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 1031 million an increase in inventory of 605 million and an increase in income taxes receivable and prepaid taxes of 283 million 

other 

as of october 31 2018  our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 

we proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see notes 5 and 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and available credit under our revolver defined below will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

other commitments — credit and term loan facilities 

in july 2018 we entered into a 2200 million rmb approximately 330 million credit agreement with a lender in china to support our facilities expansion borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the chinese central bank rate plus 10 of such rate as of october 31 2018  we had 55 million  outstanding under the agreement 

on november 28 2016 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders the credit agreement providing for i a 6500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan the credit agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated may 19 2015 the 2015 agreement in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from 5000 million  to 6500 million  provide a new 1500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from may 19 2020 to november 28 2021 subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million  the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio as well as other nonfinancial covenants as of october 31 2018  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 

as of october 31 2018  we had 1338 million  outstanding balance net of debt issuance costs under the term loan of which 1200 million  was classified as longterm liabilities outstanding principal payments under the term loan are due as follows 



as of october 31 2017  we had 1440 million outstanding balance net of debt issuance costs under the term loan of which 1341 million was classified as longterm liabilities and no outstanding balance under the revolver 

the total outstanding balance of the revolver as of october 31 2018  was 3300 million  which was included in shortterm liabilities we expect the borrowings under the revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement as of october 31 2018  borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor 1125  and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor 1000  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0125  and 0200 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

subsequent to fiscal year 2018 we drew down 1500 million  under the revolver the total outstanding balance of the revolver as of december 14 2018 is 4300 million  net of repayments 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2018  

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2018  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents and outstanding debt as of october 31 2018  all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable and fixed interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

the following table presents our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

as of october 31 2018   

foreign currency risk  we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months  a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10  compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2018  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 124 million  and we would be required to pay approximately 124 million  to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 124 million  that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized loss of approximately 239 million  and gain of 44 million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2018  



equity risk  we have approximately 109 million  and 78 million  of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2018  and 2017  respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value we did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2018 and recorded 13 million  of otherthantemporary impairment during fiscal 2017 none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of “smart” devices numerous software applications apps have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors transistors are the basic building blocks for ics each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production 

the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and lower power consumption our customers are the designers of these products and are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products in shorter timeframes and at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” than competitors the designs of these chips and systems are extremely complex and necessitate stateoftheart design solutions 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software arena where the pace of innovation often requires developers—also our customers—to deliver more secure highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in 

increasingly frequent release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is prevalent in many industries across a growing array of smart devices it is crucial to have highquality secure code to ensure consumers’ privacy and safety 

our role—the silicon to software ™  partner 

synopsys products and services enable innovators across a variety of markets—from mobile electronics and finance to media medical energy industrial and automotive—to develop smart and secure products and applications across all industries our customers face tremendous pressure to build differentiated chips and develop robust code more quickly and costeffectively than ever before with the increasing amount of embedded software in today’s devices security and quality are top concerns synopsys technologies and services are designed to help our customers — both hardware designers and software developers — to speed time to market achieve the highest quality of results mitigate risk and maximize profitability our offerings span from silicon to software  

the task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to design locate and connect the building blocks of chips and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this task is a complex multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual ics and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are readytouse in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

the task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developers goal as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of defects we offer products that can help developers write higher quality more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner to the extent that developers make use of open source software in their code our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they are less costly to fix 

products and services 

revenue from our products and services is categorized into four groups 

 core eda

sales distribution and backlog 

our eda and ip customers are primarily semiconductor and electronics systems companies the customers for our software integrity solutions include many of these companies as well as companies from a wider array of industries including electronics financial services media automotive medicine energy and industrials we market our products and services principally through direct sales in the united states and our principal foreign markets we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media eg dvdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain sales and support centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain sales support or service offices in canada multiple countries in europe israel and multiple countries in asia including japan china korea and taiwan our international headquarters are located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties 

 

additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements  in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  risks related to our foreign operations are described in part i item 1a risk factors  

our backlog was approximately 37 billion  on october 31 2017  an increase from backlog of 35 billion  on october 31 2016  resulting primarily from the timing of large multiyear contract renewals backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years we currently expect that 15 billion  of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2018  backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

revenue attributable to each of our four product categories is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

aggregate revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries through multiple agreements accounted for 179  159  and 128  of our total revenue in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during such periods 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in a number of cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend placeandroute software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps ensure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design their product offering remix rights to customers gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time—because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products—the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under primarily two license types tsls and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these types of licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates  and results of operations—revenue background  

we typically license our designware ip products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties royalty arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

our hardware products which principally consist of our prototyping and emulation systems are either sold or leased to our customers our professional services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance extend and expand our product offerings research and development of existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses were 9088 million  8567 million  and 7762 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 32 million  41 million  and 37 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms price and payment terms postcontract customer support and interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products we also deliver a significant amount of engineering and design consulting for our products no single factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation which was recently acquired by siemens ag we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities 

in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers including cadence design systems inc and our customers internally developed ip we generally compete on the basis of product quality reliability and features ease of integration with customer designs compatibility with design tools license terms price and payment terms and customer support 

in the area of software integrity solutions the market is still developing we compete with other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis as well as with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

proprietary rights 

we primarily rely upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 2700 united states and foreign patents issued and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future our issued patents have expiration dates through 2037 our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may independently develop similar technology in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries while protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these thirdparty rights we license software and other intellectual property from third parties including in several instances for inclusion in our products risks related to our use of thirdparty technology are described in part i item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the electronic design automation eda industry as a whole and our eda and intellectual property ip product sales in particular is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips and integrated circuits and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls additionally as the eda industry matures consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services furthermore we depend on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenue reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio additional support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the global economy has shown improvement in recent years there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us such caution by semiconductor companies could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts 

we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to the complex law and regulations governing our industry the banking and financial services industry and the economy could affect our business in addition economic conditions could deteriorate in the future and in particular the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow in the event of future improvements in 

economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 

 if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 



 the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate due to factors that include 

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it harder for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation which was recently acquired by siemens ag we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products 

in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers internally developed ip in the area of software integrity solutions we compete with numerous other solution providers many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis we also compete with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and 

potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including software quality testing and security solutions although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services and our efforts in this area may not be successful our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 

 

difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information 

for example in october 2015 we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access which had begun in july 2015 to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system while we identified and closed the method used to gain access it is possible our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and such a breach could harm our business and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards a breach may still occur any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

our software products may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information and other destructive outcomes as a result our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we offer software security and quality testing solutions if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyberattack or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services and could result in a loss of customers sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure successful attacks could damage our reputation as a securityfocused company 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us in addition we have continually expanded our nonus operations in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 



 as our business volume increases in the asia pacific region there is inherent risk based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries and the united states that governmental influences could result in trade disruptions 

if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly in addition there is uncertainty regarding how proposed contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies especially the japanese yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and other thirdparties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

our hardware products which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems subject us to distinct risks 

the growth of our hardware products subject us to several increased risks including 

 changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 

the fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow us gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs in connection with this initiative the fasb issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases for information regarding new accounting standards please refer to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsovervieweffect of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted these and other such standards may result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results in addition we may need to significantly change our customer and vendor contracts accounting systems and processes the cost and effect of these changes may adversely impact our results of operations 

our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes changes in our geographical earnings mix unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates or by evolving enforcement practices 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows in addition us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings change then our income tax expense could increase in fiscal 2017 we repatriated 825 million of undistributed foreign earnings in anticipation of us corporate tax reform 

in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate or balance sheet at this time proposed changes in corporate tax rates the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in significant onetime charges in the period in which tax reform is enacted or could result in increases to our future us tax expense furthermore proposed changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings  

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd which represents a coalition of member countries on october 5 2015 the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries in addition the republic of ireland has changed its corporate residence rules and will require changes to our tax position by january 1 2021 on july 26 2016 hungary amended its ip regime to bring it in line with the oecd beps project and the changes were effective in fiscal 2017 changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

our income and nonincome tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made 

in july 2017 the hungarian tax authority hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary synopsys hungary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta has disallowed synopsys hungarys tax positions taken during these years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately 47 million and interest and penalties of over 18 million at current exchange rates in addition if the treatment of research expense were applied to fiscal years after 2014 synopsys hungary could lose approximately 18 million in tax benefit in tax periods subsequent to fiscal 2017 due to the enacted reduction of hungarys corporate income tax rate if the assessment is ultimately canceled the hungarian statutory accounting treatment could have an indirect adverse impact on certain tax benefits in the year of the cancellation 

we are also under examination by the tax authorities in certain other jurisdictions no material assessments have been proposed in these examinations 

we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction changes in our forecasts of 

future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results in addition a change in corporate tax rates could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2017 approximately 47 of our worldwide cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance is held by our international subsidiaries at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad and to the extent they derive from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations we intend to meet our us cash spending needs primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities as of october 31 2017 we had outstanding debt of 1440 million net of an immaterial amount of debt issuance costs under our 1500 million term loan facility and no outstanding debt under our 6500 million revolving credit facility should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights for example we and emulation  verification engineering sa eve a company we acquired in october 2012 are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately 36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement and the court in the lawsuit has entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe we have appealed from the injunction and the final judgment in the case further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  and note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the heading “legal proceedings” in addition under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment customer supplier competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to these thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert managements attention 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join us in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations including conflict minerals regulations affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues 

and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets 

from time to time our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions valuation allowances on deferred tax assets allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

mentor patent litigation 

we are engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums we succeeded to the litigation when we acquired emulation  verification engineering sa eve on october 4 2012 at the time of the acquisition eve and eveusa inc collectively the eve parties had been defendants in three patent infringement lawsuits filed by mentor each lawsuit as well as subsequent lawsuits are further described below 

background 

as mentioned above at the time of the acquisition the eve parties had been defendants in three patent infringement lawsuits filed by mentor mentor filed suit against the eve parties in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 16 2010 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6876962 mentor filed an additional suit in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 17 2012 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6947882 both cases sought damages and a permanent injunction mentor also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against nihon eve kk in tokyo district court in 2010 alleging that certain zebu products infringe mentor’s japanese patent no p3588324 the litigation matter in japan no longer exists as the japan ip high court affirmed the tokyo district court ruling that such products did not infringe mentors patent 

on september 27 2012 synopsys and the eve parties filed an action for declaratory relief against mentor in federal district court in the northern district of california seeking a determination that mentor’s united states patents nos 6009531 5649176 and 6240376 which were the subject of a patent infringement lawsuit filed by mentor against eve in 2006 and settled in the same year are invalid and not infringed by eve’s products mentor asserted patent infringement counterclaims in this action based on the same three patents and sought damages and a permanent injunction in april 2013 this action was transferred to the federal district court in oregon and consolidated with the two mentor lawsuits in that district the oregon action as further described below 

the oregon action 

after transfer of synopsys declaratory relief action to oregon and consolidation of that action with mentor’s 2010 and 2012 lawsuits synopsys asserted patent infringement counterclaims against mentor based on synopsys united states patents nos 6132109 and 7069526 seeking damages and a permanent injunction after pretrial summary judgment rulings in favor of both sides the only patent remaining at issue in the oregon action was mentors ‘376 patent 

the oregon action went to trial on the remaining mentor patent and a jury reached a verdict on october 10 2014 finding that certain features of the zebu products infringed the ‘376 patent and assessing damages of approximately 36 million on march 12 2015 the court entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe synopsys released a new version of zebu software that does not include such features synopsys accrued an immaterial amount as a loss contingency in the year ended october 31 2015 both parties appealed from the court’s judgment following the jury verdict 

the federal circuit heard the parties’ respective appeals and issued a decision on march 16 2017 the panel affirmed the jury verdict and damages award on mentor’s ‘376 patent and reversed the district court’s dismissal of mentor’s ‘176 ‘531 and ‘882 patents and synopsys ‘109 patent due to the affirmation of the verdict by the federal circuit the company accrued an aggregate amount of 390 million as a loss contingency which is the amount estimated to be the probable loss the associated charge has been recorded in general and administrative expenses in the income statements for the year ended october 31 2017

tableend

overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys inc provides software intellectual property and services used by designers across the entire silicon to 

software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure 

the security and quality of their applications we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation 

eda software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits ics also known as chips we also offer intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than design those circuits themselves we provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them to complement these offerings we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems we are also a leading provider of software tools and services that are used to improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services media automotive medicine energy and industrials 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process their research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs in addition a number of consolidations have taken place in the semiconductor industry over the past several years while we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results the future impact of ongoing consolidation is uncertain for a discussion of potential risks please see the risk factor titled “consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results” in part i item 1a risk factors  

despite global economic uncertainty we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005 we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships but also because of our timebased revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years timebased revenue consists of timebased products maintenance and service revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period due to our business model decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings and driving growth in the software security and quality market as we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market for instance in the software security and quality space and as hardware product sales grow we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue though we expect timebased revenue to continue to represent at least 90 of all revenue other than hardware revenue overall our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that these factors will help us continue to execute our strategies successfully 

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were 52week years ending on october 28 2017 october 29 2016 and october 31 2015 respectively fiscal 2018 will be a 53week year 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to the closest calendar month end 

fiscal 2017  financial performance summary 

in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  our financial performance reflects the following 

 during fiscal 2017 88 of our revenue was timebased 

effect of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “revenue recognition topic 605” this asu requires an entity to recognize revenue when goods are transferred or services are provided to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers 

since the issuance of topic 606 the fasb has issued several amendments to the asu including deferral of the adoption date initially proposed clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations 

topic 606 will be effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019 including interim periods within that reporting period the asu permits two retrospective methods for adoption we will adopt topic 606 using the modified retrospective method under which the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance is recognized at the date of initial application 

under the modified retrospective transition method we will evaluate each contract that is effective on the adoption date as if that contract had been accounted for under topic 606 from contract inception some revenue that would have been recognized in future periods under topic 605 will be recast under topic 606 as if the revenue had been recognized in prior periods as this transition method requires that we do not adjust historical reported revenue amounts the revenue that would have been recognized under this method prior to the adoption date will be a cumulative catch up adjustment to retained earnings and will not be recognized as revenue in future periods as previously planned because we expect that a slightly lower percentage of our revenue will be recognized over time under topic 606 we expect to have a small percentage of our yearend backlog to be adjusted to retained earnings upon adoption 

we derive the majority of our total revenue from technology subscription license tsl contracts we believe that the promised licenses of software ie functional intellectual property and the promise to provide substantive timely and technologically relevant updates and services in our tsl contracts reflect inputs to a combined item that represents a single overall promise to provide customer access to a suite of eda software in an integrated solution that will evolve as our customers’ industries evolve through rapid technology changes accordingly we have concluded that this single overall promise will be recognized as revenue over the term of the contract period accordingly we expect that there will be not be a material change in the nature and timing of revenue recognition for our tsl contracts under topic 606 

the timing of revenue recognition for our upfront products maintenance and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged 

we continue to assess all potential impacts of topic 606 on other multiple element software arrangements that combine many softwarerelated deliverables as the requirement to have vsoe for undelivered elements is not necessary to separate revenue from delivered software licenses which is an essential criterion for separation under the current revenue standard revenue would no longer be recognized over the arrangement period for certain of our term licenses and ip licenses we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of these changes on the remainder of our arrangements 

topic 606 also requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer this will require us to capitalize incremental costs such as commissions and other costs directly related to obtaining customer contracts and amortize those costs over the period the assets are expected to contribute future cash flows as commissions paid for renewals are commensurate with the amounts paid for initial contracts the deferred incremental costs will be recognized over the contract term under the existing rules we expense commissions based on shipments 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 20162 leases topic 842 which supersedes the lease requirements in leases topic 840 this asu requires a lessee to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease payment liability for most leases in the consolidated statement of financial position this asu also makes some changes to lessor accounting and aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance this asu will be effective for fiscal 2020 including interim periods within that reporting period and earlier adoption is permitted we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory” this asu requires the immediate recognition of current and deferred income tax effects of intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory this asu will be effective for fiscal 2019 including interim periods within that reporting period and earlier adoption is permitted we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2017 the fasb issued asu 201712 derivatives and hedging topic 815 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities this asu requires expanded hedge accounting for risk components and refining the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entitys hedging strategies this asu also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how entities assess hedge effectiveness this asu will be 

effective for fiscal 2020 including interim periods within that reporting period and earlier adoption is permitted we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 revenue recognition 

we generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses maintenance and services and to a lesser extent hardware products software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products and professional services fees hardware revenue consists of sales of field programmable gate array fpgabased emulation and prototyping products 

most of our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights bundled with postcontract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide a complete endtoend solution to the customer throughout the contract our customers are typically using a myriad of products to complete each phase of a chip design and are concurrently working on multiple chip designs or projects in different phases of the design during this time the customer looks to us to release stateoftheart technology as we keep up with the pace of change to address requested enhancements to our tools to meet customer specifications to provide support at each stage of the customer’s design including the final manufacturing of the chip the tapeout stage and other important services 

with respect to software licenses we primarily utilize two license types 

 for the two software license types we recognize revenue as follows 



met revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations for perpetual licenses in which less than 75 of the license fee and 100 of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable such revenue is reported as “timebased products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products and professional services fees we recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customers as needed revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

hardware revenue consists of sales of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products we recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs such revenue is reported as “timebased products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations these arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

we infrequently enter into multipleelement arrangements that contain both software and nonsoftware deliverables such as hardware we have determined that the software and nonsoftware deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting we recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type tsl or perpetual license such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and softwarerelated deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer with respect to tsl arrangements due to the complexity of the tools the complexity of the arrangement terms and intertwined services the license maintenance and other services are not separable and are considered as a combined unit additionally we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate the fee between these services therefore we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

revenue recognition involves certain judgment specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 



purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard enduser license arrangement or purchase agreement 

 valuation of business combinations 

we are required to allocate the purchase price to tangible assets liabilities and contingencies assumed and intangible assets acquired in a business combination any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets which are amortized over various estimated useful lives our estimates may include but are not limited to future cash flows of an acquired business the appropriate discounted rate and the cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition these estimates are inherently difficult subjective and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price allocation to the acquired assets and liabilities could be different in addition we make judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are also inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different therefore our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets and liabilities can have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

valuation of intangible assets 

we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customer relationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete capitalized software development and inprocess research and development factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material 

adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

income taxes 

our estimates and assumptions made in our tax provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 2363 million which are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2017  based on current tax law will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset or a valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

we apply a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement an uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws significant assumptions judgments and estimates including forwardlooking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses maintenance and services and to a lesser extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times 



software for unspecified future technology we recognize revenue from these term licenses in full upon shipment of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our timebased products upfront products and maintenance and services revenues for the period we derive timebased products revenue largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent from contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront products revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period we derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software and not when they are booked 

our revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters conversely a 120000 order for perpetual licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees and 100 of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

most of our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

the overall growth of our business including contributions from acquisitions has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip consulting projects royalties variability in hardware sales and due to certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due as revenue from hardware sales is recognized upfront customer demand and timing requirements for such hardware may result in increased variability of our total revenue 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher tsl revenues hardware sales ip consulting projects and to a lesser extent due to revenue from acquired companies 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business mainly due to higher tsl revenues and hardware sales 

timebased products revenue 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to the overall growth in our business including arrangements booked in prior periods and to a lesser extent contributions from acquisitions 

upfront products revenue 

changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products driven by timing of customer requirements 

as our sales of hardware products grow upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely 

fluctuate modestly such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer 

requirements 

maintenance and service revenue 

the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the increase in and timing of ip consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method and contributions from acquisitions 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of ip consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

we expect our professional services revenues to increase in future periods as a result of recent acquisitions but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total revenue 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stockbased compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our overall growth including those from acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities as well as higher product costs due to increased hardware sales we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of products revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of products revenue  cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates we expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue 

amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increases of 624 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions 375 million in hardware product costs due to increases in and timing of shipments 248 million in costs related to servicing ip consulting arrangements and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 86 million the increases were partially offset by decreases of 260 million in amortization of intangible assets 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increases of 242 million in product costs due to increased sales 197 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases which were partially offset by decreases of 134 million in costs related to our professional services revenue and 79 million in amortization of intangible assets 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increases of 474 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increases of 643 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions 57 million in consultant and contractor costs 51 million in research and development supplies and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 30 million 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were primarily attributable to increases of 408 million and 267 million respectively in personnel costs as a result of higher headcount and higher variable compensation primarily based on timing of shipments 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increases of 380 million for accrued loss contingencies as a result of litigation 188 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases and 55 million in facilities expenses partially offset by a 304 million gain as a result of a legal settlement 

general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 remained relatively flat as increases of 52 million in maintenance costs and 25 million in professional service costs were offset by 72 million of lower facilities expenses 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 



the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets 

restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2017 we recorded 366 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary and voluntary employee termination actions the restructuring actions were undertaken to position us for future growth reallocate resources to priority areas and to a lesser extent eliminate operational redundancy these charges consisted primarily of severance and retirement benefits payments under the 2017 restructuring plans are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 

during fiscal 2016 we recorded 96 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary employee terminations as of october 31 2016 there was a 57 million outstanding balance remaining in 

accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the remaining balance was paid in fiscal 2017 

during fiscal 2015 we recorded 151 million of restructuring charges pursuant to the fiscal 2015 restructuring program which included a voluntary retirement program vrp and a minimal headcount reduction program the fiscal 2015 restructuring program was completed as of october 31 2015 

the following is a summary of our restructuring activities 



see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

other income expense net 



the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets 

the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower gains in foreign currency exchange as a result of the weakened us dollar against the related foreign currencies partially offset by increased income on foreign exchange hedging contracts that was recorded in other net 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 644 which included income tax expense of 1662 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of 825 million in anticipation of potential us corporate tax reform 305 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets a settlement with the korean national tax service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of 79 million and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of 364 million these expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 381 million a us federal research tax credit of 255 million and a settlement with the taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of 109 million our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 190 which included tax benefits from a settlement with the internal revenue service irs of 207 million for fiscal 2015 and the permanent reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 371 million partially offset by tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of 375 million the impact of undistributed foreign earnings of 96 million and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of 140 million as a result of changes in the expected utilization of state tax credits the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2015 and the full year of fiscal 2016 which was recorded in fiscal 2016 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 198 which included tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of 330 million partially offset by tax benefits from the reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 124 million a settlement with the irs of 40 million for fiscal 2014 and a 

settlement with the taiwanese tax authorities of 23 million net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2012 and 2013 the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2014 as well as two months of fiscal 2015 which was recorded in fiscal 2015 

the integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among companycontrolled entities the income tax effect is generally recognized over five years these intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a companycontrolled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition 

the valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets increased in fiscal 2017 by 437 million primarily due to a change in the realizability of deferred tax assets related to the california research credit carryforwards most of the change relates to a significant increase in our share price in fiscal 2017 which resulted in a higher tax deduction that reduced the future california sourced taxable income and the amount of california research credits we expect to utilize the remainder of the increase relates to an agreement that we reached with the california tax authorities in fiscal 2017 which resulted primarily in the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance of 132 million for further discussion of the provision for income taxes repatriation and settlements see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 

as of october 31 2017  we held an aggregate of 5546 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and an aggregate of 4938 million  in our foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2017 we repatriated 825 million of undistributed foreign earnings in anticipation of us corporate tax reform additional amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions but under current us tax law would be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have provided for the us income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us however in the event additional funds from foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund cash needs in the us and if us taxes have not already been previously accrued we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

the following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2017  

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased primarily due to 1 stock repurchases under our accelerated stock repurchase agreements 2 cash used for acquisitions and intangible assets 3 purchases of property and equipment 4 repayment of debt net of proceeds and 5 payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards cash used was partially offset by cash generated from our operations and cash received from employee stock option exercises 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased products revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections partially offset by higher disbursements for operations including vendors 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of 1991 million partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 1393 million 

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of 2801 million lower purchases of shortterm investments of 702 million higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 472 million and lower purchases of property and equipment of 201 million 

cash used in financing activities 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt repayments of 1956 million partially offset by higher proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 1350 million 

fiscal 2016   compared to fiscal 2015  the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 2750 million and higher stock repurchase activities of 1200 million partially offset by lower debt repayments of 1454 million 

accounts receivable net 

our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 59 days at october 31 2017  and 63 days at october 31 2016  the decrease in dso is primarily due to the increase in revenue 

working capital   

working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 



working capital at the end of fiscal 2017 was higher than at the end of fiscal 2016 primarily due to 1 a decrease of 1951 million in shortterm debt 2 an increase of 302 million in prepaid and other current assets and 3 a decrease of 213 million in deferred revenue these changes in working capital were partially offset by an increase of 984 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease of 690 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as we sold our availableforsale investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017

other commitments — credit and term loan facilities 

on november 28 2016 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders the credit agreement providing for i a 6500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan the credit agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated may 19 2015 the 2015 agreement in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from 5000 million  to 6500 million  provide a new 1500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from may 19 2020 to november 28 2021 subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million  the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio as well as other nonfinancial covenants as of october 31 2017  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we received funding of 1500 million  under the term loan as of october 31 2017  we had a 1440 million  outstanding balance net of debt issuance costs under the term loan of which 1341 million  is classified as longterm liabilities and no  outstanding balance under the revolver outstanding principal payments under the term loan are due as follows 



as of october 31 2016  we had no  outstanding balance under the previous term loan from the 2015 agreement and a 2050 million  outstanding balance under the previous revolver from the 2015 agreement all of which are considered shortterm liabilities borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement as of october 31 2017  borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor 1125  and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor 1000  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0125  and 0200 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

subsequent to fiscal year 2017 we drew down 4500 million under the revolver and the total outstanding balance of the revolver as of december 13 2017 is 4500 million 

acquisition of black duck software  on november 2 2017 we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire privately held black duck software a leader in automated solutions for securing and managing open source software the acquisition was completed on december 11 2017 and under the terms of the definitive agreement we paid approximately 547 million net of cash acquired and assumed certain unvested equity of black duck employees the transaction was funded by us cash

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents and outstanding debt as of october 31 2017  all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable and fixed interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

the following table presents our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

as of october 31 2017   

actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations these investments are classified as availableforsale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss or oci the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income expense net realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities have not been material in any period presented 

foreign currency risk  we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months  a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10  compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2017  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 104 million  and we would be required to pay approximately 104 million  to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 104 million  that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized gain of approximately 44 million  and loss of 199 million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2017  



equity risk  we have approximately 78 million  and 98 million  of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2017  and 2016  respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value we recorded 13 million  of otherthantemporary impairment during fiscal 2017  and did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2016  none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of “smart” devices many thousands of software applications “apps” have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors transistors are the basic building blocks for ics each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production 

the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and lower power consumption our customers are the designers of these products and are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products in shorter timeframes and at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” than competitors the designs of these chips and systems are extremely complex and necessitate stateoftheart design solutions 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software industry where the pace of innovation often requires developersalso our customersto deliver highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly frequent 

release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is prevalent in many industries across a growing array of smart devices it is crucial to have highquality secure code to ensure consumers’ privacy and safety 

our rolethe silicon to software ™  partner 

synopsys products and services enable innovators across a variety of marketsfrom mobile electronics and finance to medical industrial and automotiveto develop smart and secure products and applications across all industries our customers face tremendous pressure to build differentiated chips and develop robust code more quickly and costeffectively than ever before with the increasing amount of embedded software in today’s devices quality and security are top concerns synopsys technologies and services are designed to help our customers  both hardware designers and software developers  speed time to market achieve the highest quality of results mitigate risk and maximize profitability our offerings span from silicon to software  

the task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to design locate and connect the building blocks of chips and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this task is a complex multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual ics or chips and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are readytouse in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

the task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developers goal as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and is free of errors we offer products that can help developers write higher quality more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate quality and security defects in a systematic manner to the extent that developers make use of thirdparty components in their code our products can help developers better manage its composition and security our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they are less costly to fix

product warranties 

we generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for our software products and for up to 6 months for our hardware products in many cases we also provide our customers with limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of our software products infringes on united states patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets we have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date 

support for industry standards 

we actively create and support standards that help our eda and ip customers increase productivity facilitate efficient design flows improve interoperability of tools from different vendors and ensure connectivity functionality and interoperability of ip building blocks standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations industry consortia company licensing made available to all de facto usage or through open source licensing 

synopsys’ eda products support more than 35 standards including the most commonly used hardware description languages systemverilog verilog vhdl and systemc ®  language our products utilize numerous industrystandard data formats application programming interfaces apis and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools other eda vendors’ products and applications that customers develop internally we also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our ip product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity 

our software integrity products support several existing and emerging industry standards for software coding and security such as the motor industry software reliability association misra coding standards for the automotive industry in addition our products support multiple major programming languagesincluding objective c javascript and security vulnerability coverage for cand are compatible with numerous common industry language compilers development environments and data and file formats 

sales distribution and backlog 

our eda and ip customers are primarily semiconductor and electronics systems companies the customers for our software integrity products include many of these companies as well as companies from a wider array of industries including electronics financial services energy industrials and automotive we market our products and services principally through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media eg dvdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain sales and support centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain sales support or service offices in canada multiple countries in europe israel and multiple countries in asia including japan china korea and taiwan our international headquarters are located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties  

in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  an aggregate of 50  49  and 50  respectively of synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states geographic revenue which is based on where individual seats or licenses to our products are located is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements  in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  risks related to our foreign operations are described in part i item 1a risk factors  

our backlog was approximately 35 billion  on october 31 2016  a slight decrease from backlog of 36 billion  on october 31 2015  resulting primarily from the timing of large multiyear contract renewals backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years we currently expect that 16 billion  of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2017  backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

revenue attributable to each of our four product categories is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

our ip systems and software integrity category was referred to as ip and software solutions in fiscal 2014 

aggregate revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries through multiple agreements accounted for 159  128  and 105  of our total revenue in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during such periods 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

generally we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend placeandroute software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps ensure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design their product offering remix rights to customers gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same timebecause in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional productsthe use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates  and results of operations—revenue background  

we typically license our designware ip products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties royalty arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

our hardware products which principally consist of our prototyping and emulation systems are either sold or leased to our customers hardware revenue is not material to our total revenue 

finally our global technical services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and extend our design and verification platforms and to expand our ip systemlevel software integrity and manufacturing product offerings research and development of existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses were 8567 million  7762 million  and 7188 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 41 million  37 million  and 36 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms price and payment terms postcontract customer support and interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products we also deliver a significant amount of engineering and design consulting for our products no single factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities 

in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers including cadence design systems inc and our customers internally developed ip we generally compete on the basis of product quality and features ease of integration with customer designs compatibility with design tools license terms price and payment terms and customer support 

in the area of software integrity products the market is still developing we compete with numerous tool providers some of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis as well as with frequent new entrants which include startup companies and more established software companies 

proprietary rights 

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 2600 united states and foreign patents issued and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future our issued patents have expiration dates through 2035 our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries while protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these thirdparty rights 

we license software and other intellectual property from third parties including in several instances for inclusion in our products risks related to our use of thirdparty technology are described in part i item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the electronic design automation eda industry as a whole and our eda and intellectual property ip product sales in particular is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips and integrated circuits and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls additionally as the eda industry matures consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services furthermore we depend on a relatively small number of large customers and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us for a large portion of our revenue reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio additional support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

the continued uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the global economy has shown improvement there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs including their research and development budgets which capture spending on eda products and services further uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us continuing caution by semiconductor companies could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored in addition should further economic instability affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations it could adversely affect our financial results and our business accordingly our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty and our stock price is at risk of volatile change if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if the semiconductor industry does not grow our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected conversely in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 



 if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

 the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate due to factors that include 



 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it harder for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as vendors of ip products and systemlevel solutions moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position 

our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including software quality testing and security solutions although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services and our efforts in this area may not be successful our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 

 

difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and other thirdparties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 

the fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow us gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs in connection with this initiative the fasb issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases for information regarding new accounting standards please refer to note 14 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “effect of new accounting pronouncements” these and other such standards may result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results in addition we may need to significantly change our customer and vendor contracts accounting systems and processes the cost and effect of these changes may adversely impact our results of operations 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us in addition we have continually expanded our nonus operations in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

in addition our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy 

and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies especially the japanese yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information 

for example in october 2015 we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access which had begun in july 2015 to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system while we identified and closed the method used to gain access it is possible our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and such a breach could harm our business and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards a breach may still occur any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

our software products may also be vulnerable to cyberattacks an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information and other destructive outcomes as a result our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we are offering software quality and security testing solutions through our acquisition of companies such as coverity codenomicon cigital and codiscope if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyberattack or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services and could result in a loss of customers sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our acquisitions in the software quality and security testing space may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure successful attacks could damage our reputation as a securityfocused company 

our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes changes in our geographical earnings mix an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or by material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense in addition us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our expectations regarding reinvestment of such earnings change then our income tax expense could increase 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd which represents a coalition of member countries on october 5 2015 the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries in addition the republic of ireland has changed its corporate residence rules and will require changes to our tax position by january 1 2021 on july 26 2016 hungary amended its ip regime to bring it in line with the oecd beps project and will be effective in fiscal 2017 changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made in october 2016 the hungarian tax authority hta completed an audit of our hungary subsidiary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 the hta proposed an aggregate tax assessment of 47 million which we intend to contest 

we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and certain state tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results in addition a change in corporate tax rates could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2016  approximately 85 of our worldwide cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance is held by our international subsidiaries at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad and to the extent they derive from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations we intend to meet our us cash spending needs primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities as of october 31 2016  we had outstanding debt of 2050 million  under our 5000 million revolving credit facility should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights for example we and emulation  verification engineering sa eve a company we acquired in october 2012 are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately 36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement and the court in the lawsuit has entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe we have appealed from the injunction and the final judgment in the case further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “legal proceedings” in addition under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding material pending lawsuits other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

our hardware products which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems subject us to distinct risks   

while sales of our hardware products have historically been immaterial to our total revenue increased sales of our hardware products subject us to several increased risks including 



 we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to these thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert managements attention 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join us in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations including conflict minerals regulations affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets 

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio currently consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions valuation allowances on deferred tax assets allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

mentor patent litigation 

we are engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums we acquired emulation  verification engineering sa eve on october 4 2012 at the time of the acquisition eve and eveusa inc collectively the eve parties were defendants in three patent infringement lawsuits filed by mentor mentor filed suit against the eve parties in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 16 2010 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6876962 mentor filed an additional suit in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 17 2012 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6947882 both cases sought compensatory damages including lost profits and royalties and a permanent injunction mentor also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against nihon eve kk in tokyo district court in 2010 alleging that certain zebu products infringe mentor’s japanese patent no p3588324 this case seeks compensatory damages a permanent injunction and destruction of inventory on may 15 2015 the tokyo district court ruled that such products did not infringe mentors patent mentor appealed the decision on march 30 2016 the japan ip high court affirmed the district courts ruling in our favor 

on september 27 2012 synopsys and the eve parties filed an action for declaratory relief against mentor in federal district court in the northern district of california seeking a determination that mentor’s united states patents nos 6009531   5649176   and 6240376 which were the subject of a patent infringement lawsuit filed by mentor against eve in 2006 and settled in the same year are invalid and not infringed by eve’s products mentor asserted patent infringement counterclaims in this action based on the same three patents and sought compensatory damages including lost profits and royalties and a permanent injunction in april 2013 this action was transferred to the federal district court in oregon and consolidated with the two mentor lawsuits in that district the oregon action

in the oregon action synopsys and the eve parties further asserted patent infringement counterclaims against mentor based on synopsys’ united states patents nos 6132109 and 7069526 seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction after pretrial summary judgment rulings the only patent remaining at issue in the oregon action was mentor’s ‘376 patent 

the oregon action went to trial on the remaining mentor patent and a jury reached a verdict on october 10 2014 finding that certain features of the zebu products infringed the ‘376 patent and assessing damages of approximately 36 million on march 12 2015 the court entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe synopsys has released a new version of zebu software that does not include such features both parties have appealed the courts rulings the hearing on such appeal was held on june 9 2016 and the court has yet to issue a decision 

the california action 

on december 21 2012 synopsys filed an action for patent infringement against mentor in federal district court in the northern district of california alleging that mentor’s veloce products infringe synopsys’ united states patents nos 5748488 5530841 5680318 and 6836420 the california action this case seeks compensatory damages and a permanent injunction the court stayed the action as to the ‘420 patent pending the us patent and trademark offices inter partes  review of that patent and appeals from that proceeding on january 20 2015 the court granted mentors motion for summary judgment on the 488 841 and 318 patents finding that such patents were invalid synopsys has appealed the courts ruling the hearing on such appeal was held on june 9 2016 on october 17 2016 the federal circuit affirmed the court’s decision

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys inc provides software intellectual property and services used by designers across the entire silicon to software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the quality and security of their applications we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design and test ics also known as chips we also offer intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than design those circuits themselves we provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them to complement these offerings we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems we are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality and security of software code in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services energy industrials and automotive 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also 

helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process their research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs in addition several consolidations have taken place in the semiconductor industry recently while we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results the future impact is uncertain for a discussion of potential risks please see the risk factor titled “consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers may negatively impact our operating results” in part i item 1a risk factors  

despite global economic uncertainty we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships but also because of our timebased revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years timebased revenue which consists of timebased products maintenance and service revenue represents approximately 90 of our total revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period due to our business model decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings and driving growth in the software quality and security market as we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market for instance in the software quality and security space and hardware grows we may experience increased variability in our revenue though we generally expect timebased revenue to continue to represent approximately 90 of our total revenue overall our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that these factors will help us continue to execute our strategies successfully 

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were 52week years ending on october 29 2016 october 31 2015 and november 1 2014 respectively 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to the closest calendar month end 

fiscal 2016  financial performance summary 

in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  our financial performance reflects the following 

 we derived approximately 90 of our revenue from timebased revenue in fiscal 2016 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 11 billion as of october 31 2016 of which 15 was in the us 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 revenue recognition 

we generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a lesser extent hardware products software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and professional service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees hardware revenue consists of sales of field programmable gate array fpgabased emulation and prototyping products 

most of our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights bundled with postcontract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide a complete endtoend solution to the customer throughout the contract our customers are typically using a myriad of products to complete each phase of a chip design and are concurrently working on multiple chip designs or projects in different phases of the design during this time the customer looks to us to release stateoftheart technology as we keep up with the pace of change to address requested enhancements to our tools to meet customer specifications to provide support at each stage of the customer’s design including the final manufacturing of the chip the tapeout stage and other important services 

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

 for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 



 our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term software licenses and professional services fees we recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

hardware revenue consists of sales of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products we recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue 

we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs such revenue is reported as “timebased products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations these arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

we infrequently enter into multipleelement arrangements that contain both software and nonsoftware deliverables such as hardware we have determined that the software and nonsoftware deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting we recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type tsl term license or perpetual license such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and softwarerelated deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer with respect to tsl arrangements due to the complexity of the tools the complexity of the arrangement terms and intertwined services the license maintenance and other services are not separable and are considered as a combined unit additionally we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate the fee between these services therefore we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

we make judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the 

full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

 valuation of business combinations 

we are required to allocate the purchase price to tangible assets liabilities and contingencies assumed and intangible assets acquired in a business combination any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets which are amortized over various estimated useful lives our estimates may include but are not limited to future cash flows of an acquired business the appropriate discounted rate and the cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition these estimates are inherently difficult subjective and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price allocation to the acquired assets and liabilities could be different in addition we make judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are also inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different therefore our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets and liabilities can have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

valuation of intangible assets 

we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customer relationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete capitalized software development and inprocess research and development factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant 

negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

income taxes 

our estimates and assumptions made in our tax provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 2810 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2016  will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

we apply a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement an uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws significant assumptions judgments and estimates including forwardlooking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a lesser extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times 



 our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our timebased products upfront products and maintenance and services for the period we derive timebased products revenue largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent from contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront products revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period we derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software and not when they are booked 

our revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters conversely a 120000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees and 100 of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip consulting projects royalties variability in hardware sales and due to certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due 

the sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher tsl revenues and hardware sales 

timebased products revenue 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to the overall growth in our business including arrangements booked in prior periods and to a lesser extent contributions from acquisitions 

the increase in timebased products revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to our overall growth including contributions of revenue from acquired companies 

upfront products revenue 

changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products driven by timing of customer requirements 

as our sales of hardware products grow upfront products revenue may increase but we expect it to remain consistent with our business model in which approximately 90 of our total revenue is attributable to timebased products maintenance and professional services revenue on an annual basis 

maintenance and service revenue 

the increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance 

the decrease in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the timing of contract renewals and the type of contracts that bundle maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of ip consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the increase in and timing of ip consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stock compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our overall growth including those from acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities as well as higher product costs due to increased hardware sales we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of products revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of products revenue  cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increases of 242 million in product costs due to increased sales 197 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases which were partially offset by decreases of 134 million in costs related to our professional services revenue and 79 million in amortization of intangible assets 

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of 198 million in product costs due to increased sales 168 million in costs related to our professional services revenue 114 million in personnelrelated costs driven by higher headcount including those from acquisitions 87 million in amortization of intangible assets and higher functionally allocated expenses of 26 million 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increases of 643 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions 57 million in consultant and contractor costs 51 million in research and development supplies and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 30 million 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of 396 million in personnelrelated costs driven by headcount increases including those from acquisitions and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 120 million 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 

changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase of 267 million in personnel costs as a result of higher headcount and higher variable compensation primarily based on timing of shipments 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of 135 million in personnelrelated costs driven by headcount increases including those from acquisitions 24 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of 27 million 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 remained relatively flat as increases of 52 million in maintenance costs and 25 million in professional service costs were offset by 72 million of lower facilities expenses 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of 200 million in facilities and depreciation expenses including those from acquisitions 39 million in 

personnelrelated costs primarily due to higher headcount and 52 million in acquisitionrelated professional services costs the increases were partially offset by higher allocations of 205 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2014 due to increased spending in allocated costs resulting from increased headcount 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the abovementioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 



amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of products revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the additions of acquired intangible assets including from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions which were partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized 

restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2016 we recorded 96 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary employee terminations as of october 31 2016 there was a 57 million outstanding balance remaining in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the remaining balance will be paid in fiscal 2017 

during fiscal 2015 we recorded 151 million of restructuring charges pursuant to the fiscal 2015 restructuring program which included a voluntary retirement program vrp and a minimal headcount reduction program the fiscal 2015 restructuring program was completed as of october 31 2015 

the following is a summary of our restructuring activities 



see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

other income expense net 



the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to lower gains in foreign currency exchange as a result of the weakened us dollar against the related foreign currencies partially offset by increased income on foreign exchange hedging contracts that was recorded in other net 

the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a nonmarketable equity investment in fiscal 2014 and lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets which were partially offset by increased foreign currency exchange gains in the current year as a result of the strengthened us dollar against the related foreign currencies 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits from a settlement with the internal revenue service irs of 207 million for fiscal 2015 and the permanent reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 371 million partially offset by tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of 375 million the impact of undistributed foreign earnings of 96 million and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of 140 million as a result of changes in the expected utilization of state credits the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2015 as well as twelve months of fiscal 2016 which was recorded in fiscal 2016 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of 330 million partially offset by tax benefits from the reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 124 million a settlement with the irs of 40 million for fiscal 2014 and a settlement with the taiwan tax authorities of 23 million net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2012 and 2013 the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2014 as well as two months of fiscal 2015 which was recorded in fiscal 2015 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 included tax benefits from a settlement with the irs of 155 million for fiscal years 2012 through 2013 from federal statute of limitations lapses of 67 million and a settlement with the taiwan tax authorities of 39 million net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and application of settlements to other open fiscal years 

the integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among companycontrolled entities the income tax effect is generally recognized over five years these intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a companycontrolled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition for further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 

as of october 31 2016  we held an aggregate of 1658 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and an aggregate of 9515 million  in our foreign subsidiaries certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions but under current us tax law could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us however in the event funds from foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund cash needs in the us and if us taxes have not already been previously accrued we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

the following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2016  

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased primarily due to cash generated from our operations and cash received from employee stock option exercises cash generated was partially offset by cash used for purchases of treasury stock under our stock repurchase program purchases of property and equipment cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased products revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2016   compared to fiscal 2015   the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections partially offset by higher disbursements for operations including vendors 

fiscal 2015   compared to fiscal 2014   the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher disbursements for operations including vendors which were partially offset by higher cash collections 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2016   compared to fiscal 2015   the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of 2801 million lower purchases of shortterm investments of 702 million higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 472 million and lower purchases of property and equipment of 201 million 

fiscal 2015   compared to fiscal 2014   the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by purchases of shortterm investments net of proceeds from the sales of our shortterm investments of 1297 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets net of cash acquired of 545 million 

cash used in financing activities 

fiscal 2016   compared to fiscal 2015   the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 2750 million and higher stock repurchase activities of 1200 million partially offset by lower debt repayments of 1454 million 

fiscal 2015   compared to fiscal 2014   the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 2600 million which was partially offset by an increase of 1603 million for our stock repurchase activities and an increase of 995 million for repayment of debt 

accounts receivable net 

our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 63 days at october 31 2016  and 60 days at october 31 2015  the increase in dso is primarily due to the timing of billings and contract renewals 

working capital   

working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 



working capital at the end of fiscal 2016 was higher than at the end of fiscal 2015 primarily due to a 1524 million increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and a 532 million increase in accounts receivable these changes in working capital were partially offset primarily due to a 1176 million increase in deferred revenue 

other 

our availableforsale securities as of october 31 2016  consisted of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds and others we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as of october 31 2016  we had no direct holdings in structured investment vehicles subprime mortgagebacked securities or collateralized debt obligations and no exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds during fiscal 2016  we had no impairment charge associated with our availableforsale securities portfolio while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity we regularly review our investments and associated risk profiles which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio 

we proactively manage our cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see notes 5 and 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available credit under our revolver defined below will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

other commitments  credit and term loan facilities 

on february 17 2012 we entered into an agreement with several lenders the credit agreement providing for i a 3500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan principal payments on a portion of the term loan were due in equal quarterly installments of 75 million with the remaining balance paid in october 2016 on may 19 2015 the credit agreement was amended and restated in order to increase the size of the revolver from 3500 million  to 5000 million  and to extend the termination date of the revolver from october 14 2016 to may 19 2020 the amended and restated credit agreement also replaced a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum specified level of cash with a covenant requiring a minimum interest coverage ratio subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the amended and restated credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million  through may 2019 the amended and restated credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio as well as other nonfinancial covenants as of october 31 2016  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 

as of october 31 2016  we had no outstanding balance under the term loan and a 2050 million  outstanding balance under the revolver which are considered shortterm liabilities as of october 31 2015  we had a 450 million  outstanding balance under the term loan and a 1600 million  outstanding balance under the revolver all of which are considered shortterm liabilities borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement as of october 31 2016  the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor 1000  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0125  and 0200 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

the credit agreement was amended and restated on november 28 2016 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2016  



although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2016  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and outstanding debt as of october 31 2016  all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable and fixed interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

the following table presents our cash equivalents shortterm investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

as of october 31 2016   

as of october 31 2016  the stated maturities of our shortterm investments which are classified as available for sale securities are 



actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations these investments are classified as availableforsale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss or oci the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income expense net realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities have not been material in any period presented 

foreign currency risk  we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months  a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10  compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2016  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 98 million  and we would be required to pay approximately 98 million  to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased 

expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 98 million  that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized losses of approximately 199 million  and 148 million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2016  



equity risk  we have approximately 98 million  and 103 million  of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2016  and 2015  respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value during fiscal 2016  and 2015  we had no impairments to our investment portfolio none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background—from silicon to software 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings and appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of “smart” devices many thousands of software applications–“apps”–have been developed to expand the possibilities of these connected devices 

these developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput and embedded software into a single systemonchip soc necessitating highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors the basic building blocks for integrated circuits each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques such as multiplepatterning lithography and finfet transistors which in turn have introduced new challenges in design and production 

in addition to this increasing complexity due to the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products there is increasing demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and less power consumption the designers of these products–our customers–are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products at ever shorter timestomarket as well as at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software industry where the pace of innovation often requires developers–our customers–to deliver highquality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly frequent release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is prevalent in many industries and an increasing array of smart devices it can be crucial to do so 

our role 

synopsys’ products support innovators in these industries from silicon to software helping them to meet their design and timetomarket challenges we provide software tools ip hardware systems and other technologies that designers use to create chips and systems we also provide software tools that software developers use to detect critical flaws in their code 

the task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to locate and connect the building blocks of chips verifying that the resulting design behaves as intended and ensuring that the design can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this task is a complicated multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual integrated circuits and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are readytouse in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

the task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developers goal as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and free of errors we offer products that can help developers write better more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate quality and security defects in a systematic manner to the extent developers make use of thirdparty components in their code our products can help developers better manage its composition and security our products can enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they can be less costly to fix

our backlog was approximately 36 billion  on october 31 2015  an increase from backlog of 35 billion  on october 31 2014  which resulted primarily from business growth and to a lesser extent acquisitions backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years we currently expect that 17 billion  of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2016  backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may 

seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

revenue attributable to each of our four product categories is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

our ip systems and software integrity category was referred to as ip and software solutions in fiscal 2014 and ip and systemlevel solutions in fiscal 2013 

aggregate revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries through multiple agreements accounted for 128  105  and 113  of our total revenue in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during such periods 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

generally we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product the ability to offer this right to customers gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates  and results of operations—revenue background  

we typically license our designware core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties royalty arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

our hardware products which principally consist of our prototyping and emulation systems are either sold or leased to our customers hardware revenue is not material to our total revenue 

finally our global technical services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and extend our design and verification platforms and to expand our ip systemlevel software integrity and manufacturing product offerings research and development of existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses were 7762 million  7188 million  and 6692 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 37 million  36 million  and 36 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms price and payment terms postcontract customer support and interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products no one factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities 

in the area of ip products we compete against numerous other ip providers including cadence design systems inc and our customers internally developed ip and we generally compete on the basis of product quality and features ease of integration with customer designs compatibility with design tools license terms price and payment terms and customer support in the area of software integrity products the market is still developing and we compete with numerous tool providers some of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis as well as frequent new entrants which include startup companies as well as more established software companies 

proprietary rights 

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 2500 united states and foreign patents issued and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future our issued patents have expiration dates through 2034 our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries while protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these thirdparty rights 

we license software and other intellectual property from third parties including in several instances for inclusion in our products risks related to our use of thirdparty technology are described in part i item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the electronic design automation eda industry as a whole and our eda and intellectual property ip product sales in particular is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips and integrated circuits and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls additionally as the eda industry matures consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

consolidation among our customers as well as within the industries in which we operate may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio a larger support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

the continued uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the global economy has shown improvement there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs including their research and development budgets which capture spending on eda products and services further uncertainty caused by deteriorating global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us continuing caution by semiconductor companies could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored in addition should further economic instability affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations it could adversely affect our financial results and our business accordingly our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty and our stock price is at risk of volatile change if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if the semiconductor industry does not grow our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected conversely in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 

 if we do not manage the foregoing risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

for example we have recently acquired several providers of software quality and security testing tools including coverity inc and codenomicon oy this is a new though adjacent technology space for us the customers for 

these tools are diverse and include industries with which we do not have experience we may need to develop new sales and marketing strategies and meet new customer service requirements we will need to accurately predict prepare for and promptly respond to technological developments in the field such as identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages at the same time we will need to compete against new and unfamiliar competitors that may have more financial resources industry experience brand recognition or established customer relationships than we do to successfully develop our software quality and security offerings we will need to skillfully balance our investment in the space with investment in our existing products as well as attract and retain employees with expertise in these new fields if we fail to do so we may not realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions and it may have a negative effect on our earnings and financial condition 

changes in accounting principles or standards or in the way they are applied could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and could adversely affect our reported operating results 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance a change in existing principles standards or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results may retroactively affect previously reported results could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes 

for example the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow us gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs in connection with this initiative the fasb issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in may 2014  accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  that supersedes nearly all existing us gaap revenue recognition guidance and will be effective for fiscal 2019 although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption 

further efforts by the fasb and iasb to converge us gaap and ifrs accounting principles may have a material impact on the way we report financial results in areas including but not limited to lease accounting and financial statement presentation in addition the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for us companies changes in accounting principles from us gaap to ifrs or to converged accounting principles may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

 13 

 the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate due to factors that include 

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may make it harder for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the integrated circuit ic design process as well as vendors of ip products and systemlevel solutions moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products including internal designs that compete with our ip products 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes changes in our geographical earnings mix an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or by material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate for example a recent us tax court ruling may change the way stockbased compensation costs are treated in cost sharing arrangements with subsidiaries which if upheld could affect our effective tax rate and cash flow furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense in addition us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our expectations regarding reinvestment of such earnings changes then our income tax expense would increase 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd which represents a coalition of member countries on october 5 2015 the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles it is likely that some or all of these recommendations will be adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries in addition the republic of ireland has changed its corporate residence rules and will require changes to our tax position by january 1 2021 changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made 

forecasting our annual effective tax rate is highly complex as it depends on forwardlooking financial projections of our annual income and geographical mix of earnings our interpretations of the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions and the possible outcomes of tax audits among other estimates and assumptions some items cannot be forecasted or may be treated as discrete to the future periods when they occur if our estimates and assumptions prove incorrect then there may be a material difference between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates which could have a material impact on our results of operations in addition we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and certain state tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant or even any revenue 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 16 

 if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

in addition our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies especially the japanese yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information 

for example in october 2015 we discovered unauthorized thirdparty access which had begun in july 2015 to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system while we identified and closed the method used to gain access and do not expect the incident to impact our financial results it is possible our security measures may be circumvented again in the future and such a breach could harm our business and reputation the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data as well as other safeguards a breach may still occur any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

our software products may also be vulnerable to cyberattacks an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to our or our customers’ proprietary information and other destructive outcomes as a result our reputation could suffer customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we recently began offering software quality and security testing solutions as a result of our acquisitions of coverity and codenomicon if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyberattack or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our security testing products may 

fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and could result in a loss of customers sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our acquisitions of coverity and codenomicon may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure successful attacks could damage our reputation as a securityfocused company 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2015  approximately 839 of our worldwide cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance is held by our international subsidiaries at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad to the extent they derive from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations we intend to meet our us cash spending needs primarily through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities as of october 31 2015  we had outstanding debt of 450 million   under our 1500 million term loan facility and 1600 million of outstanding debt under our 5000 million revolving credit facility should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed these liquidity sources we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights for example we and emulation  verification engineering sa eve a company we acquired in october 2012 are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately 36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement and the court in the lawsuit has entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe we have appealed from the injunction and the final judgment in the case further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  in addition under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding material pending lawsuits other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to this thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development process and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers and our reputation 

the inclusion of thirdparty intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability regardless of outcome infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management attention 

some of our products and technology including those we acquire may include software licensed under open source licenses some open source licenses could require us under certain circumstances to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders if we are unable to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other new regulations including conflict minerals regulations affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues 

and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets 

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio currently consists of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds municipal securities and other securities and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

mentor patent litigation 

we are engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums we acquired emulation  verification engineering sa eve on october 4 2012 at the time of the acquisition eve and eveusa inc collectively the eve parties were defendants in three patent infringement lawsuits filed by mentor mentor filed suit against the eve parties in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 16 2010 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6876962 mentor filed an additional suit in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 17 2012 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6947882 both cases sought compensatory damages including lost profits and royalties and a permanent injunction mentor also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against nihon eve kk in tokyo district court in 2010 alleging that certain zebu products infringe mentor’s japanese patent no p3588324 this case seeks compensatory damages a permanent injunction and destruction of inventory on may 15 2015 the tokyo district court ruled that such products did not infringe mentors patent mentor has appealed the decision 

on september 27 2012 synopsys and the eve parties filed an action for declaratory relief against mentor in federal district court in the northern district of california seeking a determination that mentor’s united states patents nos 6009531 5649176 and 6240376 which were the subject of a patent infringement lawsuit filed by mentor against eve in 2006 and settled in the same year are invalid and not infringed by eve’s products and that mentor is without right or authority to threaten or maintain suit against the plaintiffs on such patents mentor asserted patent infringement counterclaims in this action based on the same three patents and sought compensatory damages including lost profits and royalties and a permanent injunction in april 2013 this action was transferred to the federal district court in oregon and consolidated with the two mentor lawsuits in that district the oregon action 

the oregon action 

in the oregon action synopsys and the eve parties further asserted patent infringement counterclaims against mentor based on synopsys’ united states patents nos 6132109 and 7069526 seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction after pretrial summary judgment rulings the only patent remaining at issue in the oregon action was mentor’s ‘376 patent 

the oregon action went to trial on the remaining mentor patent and a jury reached a verdict on october 10 2014 finding that certain features of the zebu products infringed the ‘376 patent and assessing damages of approximately 36 million on march 12 2015 the court entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities 

relating to the features found by the jury to infringe synopsys has released a new version of zebu software that does not include such features both parties have appealed from the final judgment 

the california action 

on december 21 2012 synopsys filed an action for patent infringement against mentor in federal district court in the northern district of california alleging that mentor’s veloce products infringe synopsys’ united states patents nos 5748488 5530841 5680318 and 6836420 the california action this case seeks compensatory damages and a permanent injunction the court stayed the action as to the ‘420 patent pending the us patent and trademark offices inter partes  review of that patent discussed below on january 20 2015 the court granted mentors motion for summary judgment on the 488 841 and 318 patents finding that such patents were invalid synopsys has appealed the courts ruling 

pto proceedings 

on september 26 2012 synopsys filed two inter partes review requests with the us patent and trademark office the pto challenging the validity of mentor’s ‘376 and ‘882 patents the pto granted review of the ‘376 patent and denied review of the ‘882 patent on february 19 2014 the pto issued its final decision in the review of the ‘376 patent finding some of the challenged claims invalid and some of the challenged claims valid on april 22 2014 synopsys appealed to the federal circuit from the pto’s decision mentor filed a crossappeal on may 2 2014

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys inc provides software intellectual property and services used by designers along the entire silicon to software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the quality and security of their applications we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits also known as chips we also offer intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves we provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them to complement these offerings which are sold primarily to semiconductor and electronics companies we provide technical services to support our solutions and help our customers develop chips and electronic systems we are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality and security of software code in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services energy and industrials 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs in addition a number of consolidations 

have taken place in the semiconductor industry recently while we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results the future impact is uncertain please see the risk factor titled “consolidation among our customers as well as within the industries in which we operate may negatively impact our operating results” in part i item 1a risk factors  for a discussion of potential risks 

despite global economic uncertainty we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technology and strong customer relationships but also because of our timebased revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years timebased revenue which consists of timebased license maintenance and service revenue generally represents approximately 90 of our total revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period due to our business model decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our eda products expanding and proliferating our ip offerings and driving growth in the software quality and security market which we entered with our acquisition of coverity inc we have continued to make investments in the software quality and security space with additional recent acquisitions which we believe have expanded our total addressable market as we continue to expand our product portfolio for instance in ip products and our total addressable market we may experience increased variability in our revenue though we generally expect timebased revenue to continue to represent approximately 90 of our total revenue overall our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technology customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that these factors will help us continue to successfully execute our strategies 

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013 were 52week years ending on october 31 2015 november 1 2014 and november 2 2013 respectively 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to the closest calendar month end 

fiscal 2015  financial performance summary 

in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  our financial performance reflects the following 

 we continued to derive more than 90 of our revenue from timebased revenue in fiscal 2015 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 revenue recognition 

we generate our revenue from the sale of our software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a small extent hardware products software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and professional service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees hardware revenue consists of sales of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products 

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

 for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

 our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term software licenses and professional services fees we recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer 

revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

hardware revenue consists of sales of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products we recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue 

we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs such revenue is reported as “timebased license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations these arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

we infrequently enter into multipleelement arrangements that contain both software and nonsoftware deliverables such as hardware we have determined that the software and nonsoftware deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting we recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type tsl term license or perpetual license such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and softwarerelated deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 

we make judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

 29 

 valuation of business combinations 

we are required to allocate the purchase price to tangible assets liabilities and contingencies assumed and intangible assets acquired in a business combination any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets which are amortized over various estimated useful lives our estimates may include but are not limited to future cash flows of an acquired business the appropriate discounted rate and the cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition these estimates are inherently difficult subjective and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price allocation to the acquired assets and liabilities could be different in addition we make judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are also inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different therefore our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets and liabilities can have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

valuation of intangible assets 

we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customer relationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete capitalized software development and inprocess research and development factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

income taxes 

our estimates and assumptions made in our tax provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount 

that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 2720 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2015  will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

we apply a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement an uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws significant assumptions judgments and estimates including forwardlooking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a small extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times 

 our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront license maintenance and professional services for the period we derive timebased license revenue largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period we derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software and not when they are booked 

our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters conversely a 120000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees and 100 of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip consulting projects and royalties and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due as well as volatility in hardware sales 

the sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2015 was due to our overall organic growth and revenues from acquired companies the increases were primarily in timebased license revenue and hardware sales 

timebased license revenue 

the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in tsl license revenue due to our overall growth including contributions of revenue from acquired companies 

upfront license revenue 

changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products 

upfront license revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was relatively flat with a slight increase in the sale of perpetual licenses to ip systems and software integrity products 

as our sales of hardware products grow upfront license revenue may increase as a percentage of total revenue but we expect it to remain consistent with our business model in which approximately 90 of our total revenue consists of timebased revenue 

maintenance and service revenue 

changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of contract renewals and the type of contracts that bundle maintenance 

the decrease in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the timing of contract renewals and the type of contracts that bundle maintenance 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the increase in and timing of ip customization projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

the decrease in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the timing of ip customization projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stock compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our organic growth and acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities amortization of intangible assets and depreciation we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of license revenue  cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions 

the increase of cost of revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of 198 million in product costs due to increased sales 168 million in costs related to our professional services revenue 114 million in personnelrelated costs driven by higher headcount including those from acquisitions 87 million in amortization of intangible assets and higher functionally allocated expenses of 26 million 

cost of revenue remained relatively flat in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 as increases in personnelrelated costs of 204 million driven by higher headcount and increases in consulting services were partially offset by lower product costs of 153 million primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments that were recorded in fiscal 2013 and a decrease of 30 million in amortization of intangible assets due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of 396 million in personnelrelated costs driven by headcount increases including those from acquisitions and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 120 million 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of 365 million in personnelrelated costs driven by headcount increases including those from acquisitions functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 122 million and a 32 million increase in consultant and contractor costs 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 

changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of 135 million in personnelrelated costs driven by headcount increases including those from acquisitions 24 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of 27 million 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of 212 million in personnelrelated costs driven by headcount increases including those from acquisitions an increase of 40 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of 20 million 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of 200 million in facilities and depreciation expenses including those from acquisitions 39 million in personnelrelated costs primarily due to higher headcount and 52 million in acquisitionrelated professional services costs the increases were partially offset by higher allocations of 205 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2014 due to increased spending in allocated costs resulting from increased headcount 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases of 104 million in facilities and depreciation expenses 98 million in professional service costs 24 million of acquisitionrelated costs and 12 million in personnelrelated costs the increases were partially offset by higher allocations of 153 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2013 due to increased spending in allocated costs resulting from increased headcount 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

acquired inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd costs relate to inprocess technologies acquired in acquisitions the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology the successful development of the iprd its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at the time of determination 

upon completion of development the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue iprd projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 



amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the additions of acquired intangible assets including from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions which were partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized 

amortization of intangible assets was relatively flat for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 as the full amortization of certain intangible assets was offset by additions of intangible assets in fiscal 2014 

restructuring charges 

in november 2014 we initiated a restructuring program that included a voluntary retirement program vrp and a minimal headcount reduction program the vrp was offered to certain eligible employees in the united states and enrollment for those employees was completed on november 21 2014 as of october 31 2015 the program has been completed and no further charges are anticipated 

the following is a summary of our restructuring activities 



see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

other income expense net 



the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a nonmarketable equity investment in fiscal 2014 and lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets which were partially offset by increased foreign currency exchange gains in the current year as a result of the strengthened us dollar against the related foreign currencies 

the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and decreased foreign currency exchange gains as a result of less movement in foreign currency exchange rates the decreases were partially offset by a gain from the sale of a nonmarketable equity investment in fiscal 2014 that was recorded in other net 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of 330 million partially offset by tax benefits from the reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 124 million a settlement with the internal revenue service irs of 40 million for fiscal 2014 and a settlement with the taiwan tax authorities of 23 million net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2012 and 2013 the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2014 as well as two months of fiscal 2015 which was recorded in fiscal 2015 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 included tax benefits from a settlement with the irs of 155 million for fiscal years 2012 through 2013 from federal statute of limitations lapses of 67 million and a settlement with the taiwan tax authorities of 39 million net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and application of settlements to other open fiscal years our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 included tax benefits from the reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 190 million reversal of deferred taxes resulting from the merger of a foreign affiliate of 68 million and settlement with the irs of certain issues related to fiscal 2012 of 11 million the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2012 as well as a full year credit for fiscal 2013 compared to only two months of credit in fiscal 2014 as a result of the expiration of the credit on december 31 2013 for further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities as of october 31 2015  we held an aggregate of 1555 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and an aggregate of 8094 million  in our foreign subsidiaries funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are mostly generated from revenue outside north america at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings however in the event funds from foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund cash needs in the us and if us taxes have not already been previously accrued we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet cash flows and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2015  

cash and cash equivalents 

our cash decreased primarily due to cash used for stock repurchases under our accelerated stock repurchase agreements entered into in december 2014 the december 2014 asr and august 2015 the august 2015 asr debt repayments and cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets the decrease was partially offset by funds generated from our operations and proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from timebased license revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2015   compared to fiscal 2014   the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher disbursements for operations including vendors which were partially offset by higher cash collections 

fiscal 2014   compared to fiscal 2013   the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections which were partially offset by higher disbursements for operations including vendors 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2015   compared to fiscal 2014   the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by purchases of shortterm investments net of proceeds from the sales of our shortterm investments of 1297 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets net of cash acquired of 545 million 

fiscal 2014   compared to fiscal 2013   the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets net of cash acquired of 3946 million 

cash used in financing activities 

fiscal 2015   compared to fiscal 2014   the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 2600 million which was partially offset by an increase of 1603 million for our stock repurchase activities and an increase of 995 million for repayment of debt 

fiscal 2014   compared to fiscal 2013   the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest in springsoft inc for 440 million in fiscal 2013 and a decrease of 253 million in purchases of treasury stock partially offset by a decrease of 498 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock we repaid our senior unsecured revolving credit facility balance of 2000 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 which had been drawn down during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 

accounts receivable net 

our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 60 days at october 31 2015  and 55 days at october 31 2014  the increase in dso is attributable to the growth in our business and timing of billings at the end of fiscal 2015 

working capital   

working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 



working capital at the end of fiscal 2015 was lower than at the end of fiscal 2014 primarily due to 1 a 1747 million increase in shortterm debt 2 a 1496 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and 3 a 400 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing these changes in working capital were partially offset by 1 a 1287 million increase in shortterm investments 2 a 590 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of our billings at the end of fiscal 2015 and 3 a 202 million increase in income taxes receivable and prepaid taxes 

other 

our availableforsale securities as of october 31 2015 consisted of investmentgrade us government agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit money market funds and others we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as of october 31 2015 we had no direct holdings in structured investment vehicles subprime mortgagebacked securities or collateralized debt obligations and no exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds during fiscal 2015 we had no impairment charge associated with our availableforsale securities portfolio while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity we regularly review our investments and associated risk profiles which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio 

we proactively manage our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase activities to ensure ample liquidity additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our investment portfolio is strong with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see notes 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available credit under our revolver defined below will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

other commitments 

on february 17 2012  we entered into an agreement with several lenders the credit agreement providing for i a 3500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan principal payments on a portion of the term loan are due in equal quarterly installments of 75 million with the remainder due in october 2016  we can elect to make prepayments on the term loan in whole or in part without premium or penalty on may 19 2015 the credit agreement was amended and restated in order to increase the size of the revolver from 3500 million  to 5000 million  and to extend the termination date of the revolver from october 14 2016 to may 19 2020 the amended and restated credit agreement also replaced a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum specified level of cash with a covenant requiring a minimum interest coverage ratio subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the amended and restated credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million  through may 2019 the amended and restated credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio as well as other nonfinancial covenants as of october 31 2015  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 

as of october 31 2015  we had a 450 million  outstanding balance under the term loan and a 1600 million  outstanding balance under the revolver all of which is considered short term as of october 31 2014  we had a 750 million  outstanding balance under the term loan of which 450 million   was classified as longterm and no outstanding balance under the revolver borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement as of october 31 2015  borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor 1125  and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor 1000  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0125  and 0200 per year based our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2015

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2015  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and outstanding debt as of october 31 2015  all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable and fixed interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

the following tables present our cash equivalents shortterm investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

as of october 31 2015   

as of october 31 2015  the stated maturities of our shortterm investments which are classified as available for sale securities are 



actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations these investments are classified as availableforsale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss or oci the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income expense net realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities have not been material in any period presented the following table presents the amounts of our shortterm investments that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of effective maturity and average book yield 

foreign currency risk  we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months  a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10  compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2015  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 98 million  and we would be required to pay approximately 98 million  to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 98 million  that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized losses of approximately 148 million  and 111 million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2015  



the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2014  



equity risk  we have approximately 103 million  and 109 million  of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2015  and 2014  respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value 

if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value during fiscal 2015  and 2014  we had no impairments to our investment portfolio none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings and appliances and other consumer products is expanding the landscape of “smart” devices 

these developments depend in large part on chips it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput into a single systemonchip soc resulting in highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors the basic building blocks for integrated circuits each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production becoming too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques such as double patterning lithography and finfet transistors which introduce their own challenges in design and production 

in addition due to the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products there is increasing demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and less power consumption the designers of these products—our customers—are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products at ever shorter timestomarket as well as at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design often hinges on “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” 

a similar dynamic is at work in the software industry where the pace of innovation requires developers to deliver high quality software which can include millions of lines of code in increasingly shrinking release cycles bugs defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix but at a time when software is prevalent in many industries and in an increasing array of smart devices it can be crucial to do so 

synopsys is at the heart of accelerating innovation in the electronics industry we provide the software tools ip hardware and other technologies that designers use to create chips and systems we also provide the software tools that software developers use to detect critical flaws in their code 

the task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to locate and connect the building blocks of chips verifying that the resulting design behaves as intended and ensuring that the design can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this task is a complicated multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual integrated circuits and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are readytouse in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them direct resources to features that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers 

the task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developers goal as efficiently as possible but that also runs securely and free of errors we offer products that can help developers write better more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and security vulnerabilities adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process and helping to eliminate quality and security defects in a systematic manner our products can enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle when they can be less costly to fix

support for industry standards 

we actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity facilitate efficient design flows improve interoperability of tools from different vendors and ensure connectivity functionality and interoperability of ip building blocks standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations industry consortia company licensing made available to all de facto usage or through open source licensing 

synopsys’ products support more than 35 standards including the most commonly used hardware description languages systemverilog verilog vhdl and systemc our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats application programming interfaces and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools other eda vendors’ products and applications that customers develop internally we also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our ip product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity 

sales distribution and backlog 

our eda and ip customers are primarily semiconductor and electronics systems companies the customers for our coverity software solutions products include many of these companies as well as companies in a wider array of industries including financial services energy and industrials we market our products and services principally through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media eg dvdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain salessupport centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain sales support or service offices in canada multiple countries in europe israel japan china korea taiwan and other countries in asia our foreign headquarters for financial and tax purposes are located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties  

in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  an aggregate of 50  52  and 52  respectively of synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states geographic revenue which is based on customer server site location is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements  in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  risks related to our foreign operations are described in part i item 1a risk factors  

our backlog was approximately 35 billion  on october 31 2014  representing a 13  increase from backlog of 31 billion  on october 31 2013  which resulted primarily from the renewal in fiscal 2014 of large multiyear contracts business growth and to a lesser extent acquisitions backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years we currently expect that 17 billion  of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2015  backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

revenue attributable to each of our four platforms established for management reporting purposes is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

our ip and software solutions platform was referred to as ip and systemlevel solutions in fiscal 2013 and 2012 

revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for 105  113  and 105  of our total revenue in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and extend our design and verification platforms and to expand our manufacturing ip systemlevel and software solutions product offerings research and development of existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses were 7188 million  6692 million  and 5816 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 36 million  36 million  and 33 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms price and payment terms postcontract customer support and interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products no one factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets 

our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities in the ip area we compete generally on product quality and features ease of integration with customer designs compatibility with design tools license terms price and payment terms and customer support in the software solutions area we compete with numerous tool providers some of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality 

analysis as well as frequent new entrants which include startup companies as well as more established software companies 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in many cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates  and results of operations — revenue background  

we typically license our designware core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties 

finally our global technical services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

proprietary rights 

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 2100 united states and foreign patents issued and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future our issued patents have expiration dates through 2033 our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries we are not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license with respect to our proprietary rights 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these thirdparty rights

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the continued uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the global economy has shown improvement there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs including their research and development budgets which capture spending on electronic design automation eda products and services further uncertainty caused by a global recession could lead some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us continuing caution by semiconductor companies could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored events such as the timing and execution of the tapering of asset purchases by the us federal reserve may continue to drive stock market and interest rate volatility consumer confidence and product demand in addition should further economic instability affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services or cause them to default on their obligations it could adversely affect our financial results and our business accordingly our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty and our stock price is at risk of volatile change if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if the semiconductor industry does not grow our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected conversely in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 

the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the eda industry as a whole and our business in particular is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of systemsonchips and integrated circuits and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls additionally as the eda industry matures consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty intellectual property ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for 

use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets commercially unacceptable terms or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 

 if we do not manage these risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

for example we recently completed our acquisition of coverity inc coverity a leading provider of software quality testing and security tools this is a new though adjacent technology space for us coveritys customer base is more diverse and includes industries with which we do not have experience we may need to develop new sales and marketing strategies and meet new customer service requirements at the same time coverity competes with different competitors from those for our existing products and these competitors may have more financial resources industry experience or established customer relationships than we do to successfully develop our coverity offerings we will need to skillfully balance our investment in the software quality testing and security tools space with investment in our existing products as well as attract and retain employees with expertise in these new fields if we fail to do so we may not realize the expected benefits of the coverity acquisition and it may have a negative effect on our earnings and financial condition 

consolidation among our customers as well as within the industries in which we operate may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio a larger support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

changes in accounting principles or standards or in the way they are applied could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and could adversely affect our reported operating results 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance a change in existing principles standards or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results may retroactively affect previously reported results could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes 

for example the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow us gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs in connection with this initiative the fasb issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in may 2014 – accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 – that supersedes nearly all existing us gaap revenue recognition guidance although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption 

further efforts by the fasb and iasb to converge us gaap and ifrs accounting principles may have a material impact on the way we report financial results in areas including but not limited to lease accounting and financial statement presentation in addition the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for us companies changes in accounting principles from us gaap to ifrs or to converged accounting principles may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 

many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

 13 

 the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate due to factors that include 

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline additionally our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock which could cause our stock price to decline 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the integrated circuit ic design process as well as vendors of ip products and systemlevel solutions moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 14 

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes changes in our geographical earnings mix an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or by material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical earnings mix including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense in addition us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project being undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these contemplated changes if finalized and adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because 

of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made 

forecasting our annual effective tax rate is highly complex as it depends on forwardlooking financial projections of our annual income and geographical mix of earnings our interpretations of the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions and the possible outcomes of tax audits among other estimates and assumptions some items cannot be forecasted or may be treated as discrete to the future periods when they occur if our estimates and assumptions prove incorrect then there may be a material difference between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates which could have a material impact on our results of operations in addition we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and certain state tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant or even any revenue 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

in addition our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations 

any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies especially the japanese yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of october 31 2014  approximately 836 of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries in their own accounts outside the united states at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad to the extent they are derived from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations we intend to meet our us cash spending needs through our existing us cash balances ongoing us cash flows and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities as of october 31 2014  we had outstanding debt of 750 million under our 150 million term loan facility and no outstanding debt under our 350 million revolving credit facility in december 2014 we drew down 2500 million under our revolving credit facility should our us cash spending needs rise and exceed these liquidity sources we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure or the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights for example we and emulation  verification engineering sa eve a company we acquired in october 2012 are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately 36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement which we plan to appeal further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  in addition under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation particularly that of our coverity security testing solutions 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

we recently began offering software quality and security testing solutions as a result of our acquisition of coverity cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated change frequently and often go undetected until after an attack has been launched if we fail to identify these new and complex methods of attack or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors our coverity security testing products may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers’ software code an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our coverity products and could result in a loss of customers sales or an increased cost to remedy a problem furthermore our acquisition of coverity may increase our visibility as a securityfocused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding material pending lawsuits other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders in addition we are required under us gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results of operations for employee sharebased equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which increases the pressure to limit equitybased compensation these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future which could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other new regulations including conflict minerals regulations affecting our hardware products have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets 

our cash equivalent portfolio currently consists of taxexempt money market mutual funds taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits in general our investment portfolio may carry both interest rate risk and credit risk we may hold fixed rate debt securities that can have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates or floating rate securities that may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack epidemic or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

we are subject to routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors 

mentor patent litigation 

we are engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation mentor involving several actions in different forums we acquired emulation  verification engineering sa eve on october 4 2012 at the time of the acquisition eve and eveusa inc collectively the eve parties were defendants in three patent infringement lawsuits filed by mentor mentor filed suit against the eve parties in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 16 2010 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6876962 mentor filed an additional suit in federal district court in the district of oregon on august 17 2012 alleging that eve’s zebu products infringed mentor’s united states patent no 6947882 both cases sought compensatory damages including lost profits and royalties and a permanent injunction mentor also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against nihon eve kk in tokyo district court in 2010 alleging that eve’s zebu series of products infringes mentor’s japanese patent no p3588324 this case seeks compensatory damages a permanent injunction and destruction of inventory 

on september 27 2012 synopsys and the eve parties filed an action for declaratory relief against mentor in federal district court in the northern district of california seeking a determination that mentor’s united states patents nos 6009531 5649176 and 6240376 which were the subject of a patent infringement lawsuit filed by mentor against eve in 2006 and settled in the same year are invalid and not infringed by eve’s products and that mentor is without right or authority to threaten or maintain suit against the plaintiffs on such patents mentor asserted patent infringement counterclaims in this action based on the same three patents and sought compensatory damages including lost profits and royalties and a permanent injunction in april 2013 this action was transferred to the federal district court in oregon and consolidated with the two mentor lawsuits in that district the oregon action 

the oregon action 

in the oregon action synopsys and the eve parties further asserted patent infringement counterclaims against mentor based on synopsys’ united states patents nos 6132109 and 7069526 seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction on february 21 2014 the court granted mentor’s motion for partial summary judgment based on assignor estoppel in which mentor argued synopsys was barred from challenging the validity of mentor’s ‘376 patent in july 2014 the court granted synopsys’ motion for partial summary judgment on the ‘531 and ‘176 patents finding that mentor was barred from asserting those patents under the doctrine of res judicata  the court also granted crossmotions for partial summary judgment brought by both parties finding that mentor’s ‘962 and ‘882 patents and synopsys’ ‘109 and ‘526 patents were noninfringed andor invalid as a result of these rulings the only patent remaining at issue in the oregon action is mentor’s ‘376 patent 

the oregon action went to trial on the remaining mentor patent and a jury reached a verdict on october 10 2014 finding that certain features of the zebu products infringed the ‘376 patent and assessing damages of approximately 36 million mentor has also filed a request for injunction based on the jury verdict synopsys is opposing mentor’s request for injunction and intends to appeal from the verdict 

the california action 

on december 21 2012 synopsys filed an action for patent infringement against mentor in federal district court in the northern district of california alleging that mentor’s veloce products infringe synopsys’ united states patents nos 5748488 5530841 5680318 and 6836420 the california action this case seeks compensatory damages and a permanent injunction the court stayed the action as to the ‘420 patent pending the us patent and trademark offices inter partes  review of that patent discussed below and it scheduled trial of synopsys’ remaining claims for march 2 2015 

pto proceedings 

on september 26 2012 synopsys filed two inter partes review requests with the us patent and trademark office the pto challenging the validity of mentor’s ‘376 and ‘882 patents the pto granted review of the ‘376 patent and denied review of the ‘882 patent on february 19 2014 the pto issued its final decision in the review of the ‘376 patent finding some of the challenged claims invalid and some of the challenged claims valid on april 22 2014 synopsys appealed to the federal circuit from the pto’s decision mentor filed a crossappeal on may 2 2014

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys is a global leader in providing software intellectual property and services used to design integrated circuits and electronic systems we supply the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design create prototypes for and test integrated circuits also known as chips we also offer intellectual property ip products which are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves we provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them to complement these product offerings we provide technical services to support our solutions and help our customers develop chips and electronic systems we are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality security and timetomarket of software code in a wide variety of industries including electronics financial services energy and industrials 

our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 

despite global economic uncertainty we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technology and strong customer relationships but also because of our timebased revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years timebased revenue which consists of timebased license maintenance and service revenue generally represents approximately 90 of our total revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period due to our business model decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

as we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market for instance in ip products we may experience increased variability in our revenue though we expect timebased revenue to continue to generally represent approximately 90 of our total revenue overall our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technology customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition strategy we believe that these factors will help us continue to successfully execute our strategies 

acquisition of coverity 

on march 24 2014 we acquired coverity inc coverity the leading provider of software quality testing and security tools we believe this acquisition has enabled us to enter into a new growing market dedicated to helping companies deliver better software faster by finding software code defects as the code is being developed rather than at the end of the process coverity’s customer base includes synopsys’ semiconductor and systems customers albeit different users and budgets and extends well beyond to software developers such as independent software vendors and companies engaged in ecommerce we believe the coverity acquisition has expanded our total addressable market however due to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue and amortization of intangible assets the acquisition had a negative effect on net income for fiscal 2014 and will continue to have a negative effect in the short term we report revenue from our coverity software quality testing and security tools in our ip and software solutions group 

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year generally ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year 

fiscal 2014  and 2013  were 52week years ending on november 1 2014 and november 2 2013 respectively fiscal 2012  was a 53week year ending on november 3 2012 the extra week in fiscal 2012 resulted in approximately 26 million of additional revenue related primarily to timebased licenses and approximately 16 million of additional expenses 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to october 31 as the end of our fiscal year 

fiscal 2014  financial performance summary 

in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 we delivered 

 in addition our current year results benefited from a lower provision for income taxes 

we continued to derive more than 90 of our revenue from timebased revenue in fiscal 2014 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the new guidance will be effective for fiscal 2018 including interim periods within that reporting period using one of two prescribed retrospective methods no early adoption is permitted we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “results of operations” below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 revenue recognition 

we derive revenue primarily from our software license arrangements software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees hardware revenue consists of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products 

  

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

 for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

 28 

and 100 of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable such revenue is reported as “timebased license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

 our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term software licenses and professional services fees we recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

hardware revenue consists of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products we recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue 

we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs such revenue is reported as “timebased license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations these arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

we infrequently enter into multipleelement arrangements that contain both software and nonsoftware deliverables such as hardware we have determined that the software and nonsoftware deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting we recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type tsl term license or perpetual license such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and softwarerelated deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 

we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us 

to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

 

valuation of stock compensation 

stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with asc 718 stock compensation  we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards the blackscholes optionpricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility expected term and riskfree interest rates we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards we determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience in addition judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends these input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors that become known over time we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 

valuation of intangible assets 

we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customer relationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete capitalized software development and inprocess research and development factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

income taxes 

our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 3162 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2014 will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

we apply a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement an uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws significant assumptions judgments and estimates including forwardlooking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a small extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times in most instances we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered the weighted average license term of the tsls and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  was 29  years 36  years and 27  years respectively revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs 

revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally one year 

revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront license maintenance and professional services for the period we derive timebased license revenue largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period we derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software and not when they are booked our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters conversely a 120000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees and 100 of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals for example we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of renewals of maintenance contracts timing of ip consulting projects and royalties and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due as well as volatility in hardware sales 

the sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2014 was due to our organic growth and revenues from acquired companies the increases were primarily in timebased license revenue fiscal 2012 had approximately 26 million of additional revenue due to the additional week in that fiscal year 

timebased license revenue 

the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to increases in tsl license revenue due to our overall growth including contributions of revenue from acquired companies 

the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to increases in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods including those from acquisitions in fiscal 2012 and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and to a lesser extent due to other timebased arrangements the increase was partially offset by the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2012 

upfront license revenue 

changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

upfront license revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was relatively flat with a slight increase in the sale of perpetual licenses to ip and software solutions products 

the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses to ip and software solutions products including those derived from our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

as our sales of hardware and perpetual licenses to ip and software solutions products grow we expect upfront license revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue but remain consistent with our business model in which approximately 90 of our total revenue consists of timebased revenue 

maintenance and service revenue 

changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing and type of contracts that bundle maintenance the fluctuations in maintenance revenue in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 were primarily due to timing 

the slight decrease in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the timing of ip customization projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 

the increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in ip consulting services 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stock compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities amortization of intangible assets and depreciation the increases in our expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 were partially offset by the extra week of expenses in fiscal 2012 of 16 million we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of license revenue  cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to thirdparty vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization and costs 

associated with the delivery of our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of certain contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships and covenants not to compete related to acquisitions 

cost of revenue remained relatively flat in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 as increases in personnelrelated costs of 204 million driven by higher headcount and increases in consulting services were partially offset by lower product costs of 153 million primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments that were recorded in fiscal 2013 and a decrease of 30 million in amortization of intangible assets due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized 

cost of revenue increased by 609 million or 16 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to increases of 230 million in amortization of intangible assets and 177 million in personnelrelated costs primarily as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2012 particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and 259 million in product costs primarily due to product sales the increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 22 million in fiscal 2012 and a 13 million reduction in acquisitionrelated costs compared to fiscal 2012 

changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

operating expenses 

research and development 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of 365 million in personnelrelated costs primarily as a result of headcount increases including those from acquisitions functionally allocated expenses that were higher by 122 million and a 32 million increase in consultant and contractor costs 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to increases of 761 million in personnelrelated costs and 110 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions in fiscal 2012 particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and 86 million in consulting costs the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 75 million in fiscal 2012 and a 63 million reduction in acquisitionrelated costs compared to fiscal 2012 

changes in other research and development expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

sales and marketing 

changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of 212 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases including those from 

acquisitions an increase of 40 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of 20 million 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was due to increases in personnelrelated costs of 159 million primarily driven by headcount increases 20 million in marketing activities and 14 million in maintenance the increase in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 49 million in fiscal 2012 and a 52 million reduction in acquisitionrelated costs compared to fiscal 2012 

changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

general and administrative 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases of 104 million in facilities and depreciation expenses 98 million in professional service costs 24 million of acquisitionrelated costs and 12 million in personnelrelated costs the increases were partially offset by higher allocations of 153 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2013 due to increased spending in allocated costs resulting from increased headcount 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was due to a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs of 254 million compared to fiscal 2012 and higher allocation of 77 million in expenses to other functions cost of revenue research and development and sales and marketing in fiscal 2013 as headcount growth in those functions primarily driven by acquisitions resulted in an increase in the pool of expenses to be allocated the decrease in general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases of 152 million in professional service costs 54 million in facilities and depreciation expenses primarily due to our acquisitions and 22 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions 

changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

acquired inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd costs relate to inprocess technologies acquired in acquisitions the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology the successful development of the iprd its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at the time of determination 

upon completion of development the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue iprd projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 



amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

amortization of intangible assets was relatively flat for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 as the full amortization of certain intangible assets was offset by additions of intangible assets in fiscal 2014 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements  for a schedule of future amortization amounts which is incorporated by reference here 

impairment of intangible assets  we did not record any impairment charges to our intangible assets during fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

other income expense net 



the net decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and decreased foreign currency exchange gains as a result of less movement in foreign currency exchange rates the decreases were partially offset by a gain from the sale of a nonmarketable equity investment in fiscal 2014 that was recorded in other net 

the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  was primarily due to an increase in market value of the assets related to our deferred compensation plan and an increase in gains in our foreign currency contracts partially offset by lower interest expense due to a decrease in principal payment on a term loan 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 included tax benefits from a settlement with the internal revenue service irs of 155 million for fiscal years 2012 through 2013 from federal statute of limitations lapses of 67 million and a settlement with the taiwan tax authorities of 39 million net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and application of settlements to other open fiscal years our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 included tax benefits from the reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 190 million reversal of deferred taxes resulting from the merger of a foreign affiliate of 68 million and settlement with the irs of certain issues related to fiscal 2012 of 11 million the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2012 as well as a full year credit for fiscal 2013 compared to only two months of credit in fiscal 2014 as a result of the expiration of the credit on december 31 2013 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 included tax benefits from settlements with the irs of 159 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2011 with taiwan tax authorities of 147 million net tax benefit resulting from fiscal 2008 settlement being applied to other open fiscal years and with hungarian tax authorities of 63 million for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 for further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility as of october 31 2014  we held an aggregate of 1620 million  in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of 8238 million  in our foreign subsidiaries funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are generated from revenue outside north america at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund cash needs in the united states and if us taxes have not already been previously accrued we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet cash flows and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2014  

cash and cash equivalents 

our cash decreased due to acquisitions stock repurchases and property and equipment spending during fiscal 2014 partially offset by the cash generated from our operations 

cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from timebased license revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2014   the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections which were partially offset by higher disbursements for operations including vendors 

fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2013   cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers and a decrease in tax payments offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors and higher personnelrelated costs due to increased headcount 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2014   the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets net of cash acquired of 3946 million 

fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2013   the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition activities in fiscal 2013 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2014   the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest in springsoft inc for 440 million in fiscal 2013 and a decrease of 253 million in purchases of treasury stock partially offset by a decrease of 498 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock we repaid our senior unsecured revolving credit facility balance of 2000 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 which had been drawn down during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 

fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2013   the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program proceeds from credit facilities in fiscal 2012 that did not recur in the current period and less proceeds from issuances of common stock 

accounts receivable net 

our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 55 days at october 31 2014  and 46 days at october 31 2013  the increase in dso is attributable to the timing of billings at the end of fiscal 2014 

working capital  working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 



working capital at the end of fiscal 2014 was lower than at the end of fiscal 2013 primarily due to 1 a 1007 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of billings 2 a 367 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents 3 a 389 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to timing of purchases and 4 a 242 million increase in accrued income taxes these changes in working capital were partially offset by a 707 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of our billings at the end of fiscal 2014 a 194 million increase in deferred taxes and an 82 million increase in income taxes receivable and prepaid taxes 

other 

as of october 31 2014  our cash equivalents consisted of cash deposits taxexempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 

we proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity our cash equivalents are classified within level 1 under fair value guidance see notes 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and available credit under our revolver defined below will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 

other commitments 

on february 17 2012  we entered into an agreement with several lenders the credit agreement providing for i a 3500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan principal payments on a portion of the term loan are due in equal quarterly installments of 75 million with the remainder due when the credit agreement expires in october 2016  we can elect to make prepayments on the term loan in whole or in part without premium or penalty subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million  through october 13 2015 the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2014  we drew down 2000 million  under the revolver to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of coverity on march 24 2014 and during the third quarter of fiscal 2014  we repaid the 2000 million  balance under the revolver as of october 31 2014  we had a 750 million  outstanding balance under the term loan of which 450 million  is classified as longterm and no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31 2013  we had a 1050 million  outstanding balance under the term loan of which 750 million  is classified as longterm and no outstanding balance under the revolver borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement at october 31 2014  borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor 1125  and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor 0975  in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0150  and 0300 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

as a result of the coverity acquisition we assumed coverity’s credit facility with a us bank that had an original expiration date of december 31 2014  the facility provided a maximum borrowing limit of 70  million during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we chose to terminate the coverity credit facility prior to the original expiration date 

in december 2014 we drew down 2500 million under the revolver primarily to finance the 2015 asr see part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—stock repurchase program  for further detail on the 2015 asr 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2014  

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2014  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt as of october 31 2014  all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense 

the following tables present our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

as of october 31 2014   

as of october 31 2013   

foreign currency risk  we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 20 months a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2014  the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 118 million and we would be required to pay approximately 118 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 118 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized losses of approximately 111 million and 18 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2014  



the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2013  



equity risk  we have approximately 109 million  and 115 million  of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2014  and 2013  respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value during fiscal 2014  and 2013  we did not write down the value of our investment portfolio none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is expanding the landscape of “smart” devices 

these developments depend in large part on chips it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput into a single systemonchip soc resulting in highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors the basic building blocks for integrated circuits each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production becoming too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques such as double patterning lithography and 3d finfet transistors which introduce their own challenges in design and production 

in addition due to the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products there is increasing demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and less power consumption the designers of these products—our customers—are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products at ever shorter timestomarket as well as at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design today often hinges on “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” 

synopsys is at the heart of accelerating innovation in the dynamic electronics market we provide the software tools ip hardware and other technologies that designers use to create chips and 

  

systems the designer’s task is to determine how best to locate and connect the building blocks of chips verifying that the resulting design behaves as intended and ensuring that the design can be manufactured efficiently and costeffectively this task is a complicated multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming 

we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual integrated circuits and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our ip products offer proven highquality preconfigured circuits that are readytouse in a chip design saving customers time and enabling them direct resources to projects that differentiate their products our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers

sales distribution and backlog 

our customers are primarily semiconductor and electronics systems companies we market our products and services principally through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media ie dvdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain salessupport centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain sales support or service offices in canada multiple countries in europe israel japan china korea taiwan and other countries in asia our foreign headquarters for financial and tax purposes are located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties  

in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 an aggregate of 52 52 and 54 respectively of synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the us geographic revenue which is based on customer server site location is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

 

  

additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  risks related to our foreign operations are described in part i item 1a risk factors  

our backlog was approximately 31 billion on october 31 2013 representing a 15 increase from backlog of 27 billion on october 31 2012 which resulted primarily from the renewal of large multiyear contracts in fiscal 2013 backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years we currently expect that 15 billion of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2014 backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

revenue attributable to each of our four platforms established for management reporting purposes is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

revenue by platform 

 

revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for 113 105 and 106 of our total revenue in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and extend our design and verification platforms and to expand our manufacturing ip and systemlevel product offerings research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses were 6692 million 5816 million and 4919 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 36 million 33 million and 29 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on 

  

technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms postcontract customer support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms no one factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets 

our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities in the ip area we compete primarily with our customers’ internally developed ip 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in many cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations — revenue background  

we typically license our designware core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties 

finally our global technical services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

proprietary rights 

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 2000 united states and foreign patents issued and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future our issued patents have expiration dates through 2032 our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries we are not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license with respect to our proprietary rights 

  

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these thirdparty rights

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the continued uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the global economy is improving there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs including their research and development budgets which capture spending on eda products and services for example uncertainty caused by the global recession caused some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us continuing caution by semiconductor companies could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the global recession also impacted the banking and financial services industry resulting in the downgrade of the credit ratings of many banks including banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts credit and banking transactions and deposit services worldwide while recent legislation is designed to strengthen the banking industry should any of our banking partners default on their obligations it could adversely affect our financial results and our business 

we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored events such as the timing and execution of the tapering of asset purchases by the us federal reserve may continue to drive stock market and interest rate volatility consumer confidence and product demand accordingly our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty and our stock price is at risk of volatile change if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if the semiconductor industry does not grow our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected conversely in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 

the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the eda industry as a whole and our business in particular is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends 

  

upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls additionally as the eda industry matures consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions are difficult timeconsuming and pose a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 if we do not manage these risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition additionally if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

consolidation among our customers as well as within the industries in which we operate may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services moreover business combinations within the industries in which we compete may result in stronger competition from companies that are better able to compete as sole source vendors to customers the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire business and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio a larger support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

changes in accounting principles or standards or in the way they are applied could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and could adversely affect our reported operating results 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance a change in existing principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results accounting standard changes could have a significant impact on our revenues and expenses may require costly changes to our operational processes and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations 

for example the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs these efforts may result in different accounting principles under gaap which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results in areas including but not limited to revenue recognition lease accounting and financial statement presentation the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for us companies a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs or to converged accounting principles may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively adversely affect previously reported transactions 

  

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as vendors of ip products and systemlevel solutions moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products 

  

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 

  

  

  

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also be stolen otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

  

  

  

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions our business and 

  

operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

unfavorable tax law changes changes in our forecasted or actual geographical earnings mix or an unfavorable government review of our tax returns could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the us are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

we have operations in the us and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates therefore any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and foreign tax credits and certain state tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income including foreign source income in the us as well as sufficient taxable income in certain states changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results 

the computation of our annual effective tax rate is complex as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under us gaap income tax expense benefit for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our worldwide effective tax rate this forecast includes forward looking financial projections by jurisdiction as well as a number of other estimates and assumptions various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may be treated as discrete to the period in which they occur for these reasons our worldwide effective tax rate may be materially different than our forecast and fluctuate throughout the year 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a 

  

corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant or even any revenue 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business 

we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the us in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the us our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

in addition our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies especially the japanese yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation our revenue from japan has been affected by the devaluation of the yen in the past year and may continue to fluctuate should the yen experience significant further volatility exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

more than half of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries in their own accounts outside the united states—approximately 54 as of october 31 2013 at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad to the extent they derive from indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings we have a credit agreement with several lenders providing for a 150 million term loan facility and a 350 million revolving credit facility and as of october 31 2013 we had outstanding debt of 1050 million under our term loan facility and no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility should our cash spending needs in the us rise and exceed our existing us balances available credit under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and future us cash flows we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure and the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights including patent rights for example in december 2011 a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against us by dynetix design solutions inc which seeks among other things compensatory damages and a permanent injunction we may also acquire companies that are party to existing infringement claims for example eve a company we acquired in october 2012 is a party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation further information regarding the dynetix and eve lawsuits is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  in addition under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer employment competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding 

  

material pending lawsuits other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders in addition we are required under gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results of operations for employee sharebased equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit equitybased compensation these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example our efforts to comply with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected moreover although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees such measures may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets 

our cash equivalent portfolio currently consists of taxexempt money market mutual funds taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits in general our investment portfolio may carry both 

  

interest rate risk and credit risk we may hold fixed rate debt securities that can have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates or floating rate securities that may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of current adverse financial market conditions capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired further while the us government has raised the federal “debt ceiling” to allow it to borrow funds through february 7 2014 if the debt ceiling is not raised beyond that date the us government may default which could impact the liquidity of our investment funds 

our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be otherthantemporary 

security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and reputation 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employeerelated liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant 

  

portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys is a global leader in providing software intellectual property and services used to design integrated circuits and electronic systems we supply the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design create prototypes for and test integrated circuits also known as chips we also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits our intellectual property ip products are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves to complement these product offerings we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems 

our customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 

despite global economic uncertainty we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technology and strong customer relationships but also because of our timebased revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years timebased revenue which consists of timebased license maintenance and service revenue generally represents approximately 90 of our total revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period due to our business model decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

the global economy continues to exhibit some uncertainty with 2013 being characterized by gradual and uneven economic recovery nonetheless our business outlook remains strong based on continued demand for our products our business model strong financials diligent expense management and acquisition strategy in addition consumer demand for electronics has been solid particularly the demand for mobile devices through our recent acquisitions we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market especially in ip and systemlevel solutions which we believe will help drive revenue growth we believe that the 

  

combination of our solid financials leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us to continue to successfully execute our strategies 

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year generally ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year 

fiscal 2013 was a 52week year ending on november 2 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were 53week and 52week years respectively ending on november 3 2012 and october 29 2011 respectively the extra week in fiscal 2012 resulted in approximately 26 million of additional revenue related primarily to timebased licenses and approximately 16 million of additional expenses 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to october 31 as the end of our fiscal year 

fiscal 2013 financial performance summary 

in fiscal 2013 we experienced overall growth in our business including from our acquisitions which was reflected in a 36 increase in our net income compared to last year compared to fiscal 2012 

 

  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “results of operations” below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 

  

  

  

 revenue recognition 

software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees hardware revenue consists of fpgabased emulation and prototyping products 

  

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

 

  

  

 for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

 

  

  

 we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs such revenue is reported as “timebased license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations these arrangements are not material to our total revenue 

we recognize revenue from sales of hardware and perpetual licenses to ip and systemlevel products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue 

we infrequently enter into multipleelement arrangements that contain both software and nonsoftware deliverables such as hardware we have determined that the software and nonsoftware 

  

deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting we recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type tsl term license or perpetual license such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods 

we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software related deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 

we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

 

  

   

  

 valuation of stock compensation 

stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with asc 718 stock compensation  we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards the blackscholes optionpricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility expected term and riskfree interest rates we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards we determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience in addition judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends these input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 

valuation of intangible assets 

we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customerrelationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete capitalized software development and inprocess research and development factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life we reduce 

  

the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 

income taxes 

our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with asc 740 income taxes our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 3072 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2013 will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

we apply a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a small extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times in most instances we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered the average license term of the tsls and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 was 36 years 27 years and 28 years respectively revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs 

  

revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally one year revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer 

our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront license maintenance and professional services for the period we derive timebased license revenue largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period we derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software and not when they are booked our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters conversely a 120000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees and 100 of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

 

 the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals 

the sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2013 was due to our organic growth and revenues from acquired companies the increases were primarily in timebased license revenue fiscal 2012 had approximately 26 million of additional revenue due to the additional week in that fiscal year 

  

timebased license revenue 

 

 the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to increases in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods including those from acquisitions in fiscal 2012 and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and to a lesser extent due to other timebased arrangements the increase was partially offset by the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2012 

the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to increases in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods and from the contracts acquired through fiscal 2012 acquisitions and to a lesser extent due to higher contingent revenue product sales the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2012 and other timebased arrangements 

upfront license revenue 

 

 changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses to ip and systemlevel products including those derived from our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses to ip and systemlevel products 

as our sales of hardware and perpetual licenses to ip and systemlevel products continue to grow we expect upfront license revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue but remain consistent with our business model in which approximately 90 of our total revenue consists of timebased revenue 

maintenance and service revenue 

 

   

changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of renewals and the type of contracts renewed with the associated maintenance maintenance revenue was relatively flat during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 

the sequential increase in professional services and other revenue from fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in ip consulting services 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

 

 our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stock compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities amortization of intangible assets and depreciation the increases in our expenses were partially offset by the extra week of expenses in fiscal 2012 of 16 million we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool consequently fluctuations in these drivers impact the amounts allocated to each functional area 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

cost of revenue 

 

 we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group 

  

costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of license revenue cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to third party vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization and costs associated with the delivery of our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of certain contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships and covenants not to compete related to acquisitions 

cost of revenue increased by 609 million or 16 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to increases of 230 million in amortization of intangible assets and 177 million in personnelrelated costs primarily as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2012 particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and 259 million in product costs primarily due to product sales the increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 22 million in fiscal 2012 and a 13 million reduction in acquisitionrelated costs compared to fiscal 2012 

cost of revenue increased by 522 million or 15 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to increases of 265 million in amortization of intangible assets 190 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of fiscal 2012 acquisitions and the impact of one extra week of costs of approximately 22 million in fiscal 2012 

operating expenses 

research and development 

 

 the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to increases of 761 million in personnelrelated costs and 110 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions in fiscal 2012 particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and 86 million in consulting costs the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 75 million in fiscal 2012 and a 63 million reduction in acquisitionrelated costs compared to fiscal 2012 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases of 610 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions 111 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases from our current year acquisitions 79 million in costs related to acquisitions and one extra week of costs of approximately 75 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

  

sales and marketing 

 

 changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was due to increases in personnelrelated costs of 159 million primarily driven by headcount increases 20 million in marketing activities and 14 million in maintenance the increase in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately 49 million in fiscal 2012 and a 52 million reduction in acquisitionrelated costs compared to fiscal 2012 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was due to increases in personnelrelated costs of 256 million primarily driven by headcount increases from our acquisitions 112 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments 89 million in costs related to acquisitions and one extra week of costs of approximately 49 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011

 the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs of 254 million compared to fiscal 2012 and higher allocation of 77 million in expenses to other functions cost of revenue research and development and sales and marketing in fiscal 2013 as headcount growth in those functions primarily driven by acquisitions resulted in an increase in the pool of expenses to be allocated the decrease in general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases of 152 million in professional service costs 54 million in facilities and depreciation expenses primarily due to our acquisitions and 22 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions 

the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases of 159 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions 245 million in costs related to acquisitions 68 million in facility expenses 58 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses and one extra week of costs of approximately 16 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 the increases were partially offset by a higher allocation of 180 million in expenses to other functions in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of increased expenses in the allocation pool 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

  

  

acquired inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd costs relate to inprocess technologies acquired in acquisitions the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology the successful development of the iprd its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at the time of determination 

upon completion of development the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue iprd projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and inprocess research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 

 

 amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

the increases in amortization of intangible assets from fiscal 2011 through 2013 were primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts which is incorporated by reference here 

impairment of intangible assets we did not record any impairment charges to our intangible assets during fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 

other income expense net 

 

   

the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in market value of the assets related to our deferred compensation plan and an increase in gains in our foreign currency contracts partially offset by lower interest expense due to a decrease in principal payment on a term loan 

the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in gain on assets related to our deferred compensation plan and an increase in premiums on foreign currency contracts included in other income expense net partially offset by higher interest expense due to a term loan that we entered into in fiscal 2012 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 included tax benefits from the reinstatement of the us federal research tax credit of approximately 190 million reversal of deferred taxes resulting from the merger of a foreign affiliate of 68 million and settlement with the internal revenue service irs of certain issues related to fiscal 2012 of 11 million the reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2012 as well as a full year credit for fiscal 2013 compared to only two months of credit in fiscal 2012 as a result of the expiration of the credit on december 31 2011 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 included tax benefits from settlements with the irs of 159 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2011 with taiwan tax authorities of 147 million net tax benefit resulting from the 2008 settlement being applied to other open fiscal years and with hungarian tax authorities of 63 million for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 for further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 

as of october 31 2013 we held an aggregate of 4684 million in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of 5540 million in our foreign subsidiaries funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are generated from revenue outside north america at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund cash needs in the united states and if us taxes have not already been previously accrued we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2013 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

 our cash generated from operating activities was 4967 million in fiscal 2013 

other cash activities were 1 share repurchases of 1450 million offset by proceeds from employee stock plans of 1319 million 2 purchases of property and equipment of 655 million offset by proceeds from sale of property and equipment of 20 million 3 acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in springsoft inc for 440 million and 4 repayment of a term loan of 300 million 

  

cash flows 

 

 cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from timebased license revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers and a decrease in tax payments offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors and higher personnelrelated costs due to increased headcount 

fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition activities in fiscal 2013 

fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2012 partly offset by net proceeds from the purchase and sale of investments 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program proceeds from credit facilities in fiscal 2012 that did not recur in the current period and less proceeds from issuances of common stock 

fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 the increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to net proceeds from credit facilities obtained primarily to finance our acquisitions and less common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program 

accounts receivable net 

 

 our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 46 days at october 31 2013 and 59 days at october 31 2012 the decrease in dso is attributable to the increase in collections from customers 

  

  

working capital working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

 changes in our working capital were primarily due to 1 a 3221 million increase in cash and cash equivalents 2 a 249 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of disbursements 3 a 173 million increase in deferred income taxes and 4 a 73 million decrease in deferred revenue due to timing of our billings these changes in working capital were partially offset by a 366 million decrease in accounts receivable attributable to timing and a 25 million increase in accrued income taxes 

other 

as of october 31 2013 our cash equivalents consisted of cash deposits taxexempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 

we proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity our cash equivalents are classified within level 1 under fair value guidance see notes 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

on february 17 2012 we entered into an agreement with several lenders the credit agreement providing for i a 3500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver and ii a 1500 million senior unsecured term loan facility the term loan principal payments on a portion of the term loan are due in equal quarterly installments of 75 million with the remainder due when the credit agreement expires in october 2016 we can elect to make prepayments on the term loan in whole or in part without premium or penalty subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million through october 13 2015 the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants 

as of october 31 2013 we had a 1050 million outstanding balance under the term loan of which 750 million is classified as longterm and no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31 2012 we had a 1350 million outstanding balance under the term loan of which 1050 million is classified as longterm and no outstanding balance under the revolver borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of marketobservable base rates as defined in the credit agreement at october 31 2013 borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor  1125 and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor  0975 in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0150 and 0300 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2013 

 

  

     the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2013 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt as of october 31 2013 all of our cash cash equivalents and debt were at shortterm variable interest rates while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense 

  

the following tables present our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

as of october 31 2013 

 

 as of october 31 2012 

 

 foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2013 the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 

  

92 million and we would be required to pay approximately 92 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 92 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized losses of approximately 18 million and 13 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2013 

 

   

the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2012 

 

 equity risk we have approximately 115 million and 117 million of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value during fiscal 2013 we did not write down the value of our investment portfolio and during fiscal 2012 we wrote down our investment portfolio by 05 million none of our investments are held for speculation purposes

background 

recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products particularly mobile devices the growth of the internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create store and share information at the same time the increasing use of electronics in cars buildings appliances and other consumer products is creating a broad landscape of “smart” devices 

these developments depend in large part on chips it is common for a single chip to combine many components processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput into a single systemonchip soc resulting in highly complex chip designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors the basic building blocks for integrated circuits each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair at such small dimensions the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production becoming too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers 

in addition due to the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products there is increasing demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and less power consumption the designers of these products—our customers—are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products at ever shorter timestomarket as well as at lower prices in other words innovation in chip and system design today often hinges on “better” “sooner” and “cheaper” 

synopsys is at the heart of accelerating innovation in the vibrant electronics market we provide the software tools hardware and other technologies that designers use to create chips and systems the designer’s task is to determine how best to locate and connect ic building blocks verifying that the resulting design behaves as intended and ensuring that the design can be manufactured efficiently and 

  

costeffectively this task is a complicated multistep process that is both expensive and timeconsuming we offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual integrated circuits and for the design of larger systems our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers

product warranties 

we generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for our software products and for up to six months for our hardware products in certain cases we also provide our customers with limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of our software products infringe on united states patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets we have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date 

support for industry standards 

we actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity facilitate efficient design flows improve interoperability of tools from different vendors and ensure connectivity functionality and interoperability of ip building blocks standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations industry consortia company licensing made available to all de facto usage or through open source licensing 

  

synopsys’ products support more than 30 standards including the most commonly used hardware description languages systemverilog verilog vhdl and systemc our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats application programming interfaces and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools other eda vendors’ products and applications that customers develop internally we also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our ip product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity 

sales distribution and backlog 

we market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media ie cdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain salessupport centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain sales support or service offices in canada multiple countries in europe israel japan china korea taiwan and other countries in asia our foreign headquarters for financial and tax purposes is located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties  

in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 an aggregate of 52 54 and 52 respectively of synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states geographic revenue which is based on customer site location is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

 

additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  risks related to our foreign operations are described in part i item 1a risk factors  

our backlog was approximately 27 billion on october 31 2012 representing an 8 increase from backlog of 25 billion on october 31 2011 which resulted from acquisitions during fiscal 2012 backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years we currently expect that 117 billion of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2013 

  

backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

revenue attributable to each of our four platforms established for management reporting purposes is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

 

revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for 105 106 and 109 of our total revenue in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and extend our design and verification platforms and to expand our manufacturing ip and systemlevel product offerings research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses were 5816 million 4919 million and 4492 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 33 million 29 million and 29 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms postcontract customer support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms no one factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets 

our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities in the ip area we compete primarily with our customers’ internally developed ip 

  

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in many cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations — revenue background  

we typically license our designware core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties

   item 1a risk factors 

tableend a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

the continued uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

as a result of the recent global recession the global economy experienced significant uncertainty stock market volatility tightened credit markets concerns about both deflation and inflation reduced demand for products lower consumer confidence reduced capital spending liquidity concerns and business insolvencies further declines and uncertainty about future economic conditions could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business 

the recent global recession adversely affected the semiconductor industry semiconductor companies generally remain cautious and focused on their costs including their research and development budgets which capture spending on eda products and services these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

under our business model we generally expect more than 90 of our total revenue to be recurring revenue as a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a multiyear period however the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions caused some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments our operating results would be harmed furthermore future periods of decreased committed average annual revenue customer bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers could adversely affect our yearoveryear revenue growth 

the recent global recession also adversely affected the banking and financial industry if the global economy continues to experience uncertainty our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms could be jeopardized furthermore we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts provide credit and banking transactions and deposit services worldwide should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations it could adversely affect our financial results and our business 

we cannot predict if or when global economic confidence will be restored accordingly our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty and our stock price is at risk of volatile change if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if the semiconductor industry does not continue to grow our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected conversely in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 

  

the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the eda industry as a whole and our business in particular is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics and customers’ concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the semiconductor and electronics industries do not continue to grow or grow at a slower rate additionally as the eda industry matures consolidation has increased competition for a greater share of our customers’ eda spending this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries our customers also frequently incorporate thirdparty ip whether provided by us or other vendors into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda ip and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip particularly microprocessor ip to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip work effectively together if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries’ manufacturing processes or major ip providers’ products or if our access to such foundry processes or thirdparty ip products is hampered then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years including the recent acquisitions of magma design automation inc magma springsoft inc and emulation  verification engineering sa eve 

we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks which could harm our operating results acquisitions are difficult time consuming and pose a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 if we do not manage these risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition for instance if we are unable to successfully integrate magma products and technology we may not be able to achieve the anticipated revenue growth from our magma acquisition in addition expenses associated with supporting magma’s products could result in less expense synergies than anticipated the integration process may involve significant management time and create uncertainty for employees and customers and delays in the process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues expenses operating results and financial condition additionally if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

consolidation among our customers as well as within the industries in which we operate may negatively impact our operating results 

a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently and more could occur in the future consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services moreover business combinations within the industries in which we compete may result in stronger competition from companies that are better able to compete as sole source vendors to customers the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we and our competitors from time to time acquire business and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio a larger support and service capability or lower prices which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

changes in accounting principles or standards or in the way they are applied could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and could adversely affect our reported operating results 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance a change in existing principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results additionally proposed accounting standards could have a significant impact on our operational processes revenues and expenses and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations 

for example the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs these efforts 

  

may result in different accounting principles under gaap which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results in areas including but not limited to revenue recognition lease accounting and financial statement presentation the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for us companies a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs or to converged accounting principles may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively adversely affect previously reported transactions 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline 

we operate in highly competitive industries and if we do not continue to meet our customers’ demand for innovative technology at lower costs our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more 

  

discrete phases of the ic design process as well as vendors of ip products and systemlevel solutions moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 

  

  

  

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs or fail to address new competitive forces our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally despite our measures to prevent piracy other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products which could result in lost revenue some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

  

  

  

   

if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

unfavorable tax law changes an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense currently a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the us are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we have operations in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates therefore any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments could materially impact our effective tax rate furthermore we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and foreign tax credits and certain state tax credits our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income including foreign source income in the united states as well as sufficient taxable income in certain states changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results finally there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant or even any revenue 

  

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations which may adversely affect our business 

we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

in addition our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations likewise a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies especially the japanese yen reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets which could negatively affect our financial condition 

as of december 7 2012 we have outstanding debt of 1350 million under our term loan facility primarily as a result of funding our magma acquisition most of our worldwide cash cash equivalents and short term investments balance is held in subsidiary accounts outside the united states—approximately 72 as of october 31 2012 in addition typically about half of our operating cash flow is received by our overseas subsidiaries should our cash spending needs in the united states rise and exceed our existing us balances available credit under our revolving credit and term loan 

  

facilities and future us cash flows we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources which could negatively affect our results of operations capital structure andor the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 

we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third party intellectual property rights including patent rights for example in december 2011 a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against us by dynetix design solutions inc which seeks among other things compensatory damages and a permanent injunction we may also acquire companies that are party to existing infringement claims for example eve a company we acquired in october 2012 is a party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation further information regarding the dynetix and eve lawsuits is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  in addition under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights infringement claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed further information regarding material pending lawsuits other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings  

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial 

  

employees could harm our business results of operations and financial condition additionally efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure to limit the use of such equitybased compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders in addition we are required under gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee sharebased equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit equitybased compensation these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulated organizations including the sec the nasdaq stock market and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example congress recently passed the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act our efforts to comply with the doddfrank act and other new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our investment portfolio may be impaired by deterioration of the capital markets 

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio currently consists of taxexempt money market mutual funds taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs as a result of current adverse financial market conditions capital pressures on certain banks especially in europe and the continuing low interest rate environment some of our financial instruments may become impaired our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary in addition we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and reputation 

we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to 

  

attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information furthermore in the operation of our business we also use third party vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats any security breach of our own or a third party vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions and variable compensation and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions allowances for doubtful accounts and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

due to the global nature of our business our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cybersecurity attack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders moreover our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

   item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys is a global leader in providing software intellectual property and services used to accelerate innovation in integrated circuits and electronic systems we supply the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design create prototypes for and test integrated circuits also known as chips we also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits our intellectual property ip products are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves to complement these product offerings we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems 

our customers are generally large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be impacted by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 

despite global economic uncertainty we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technology and strong customer relationships but also because of our recurring revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this recurring revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years recurring revenue generally represents more than 90 of our total revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period we typically enter each quarter with greater than 90 of our revenue for that particular quarter already committed from our customers providing for stability and predictability of results due to our business model decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 

even with the continued instability of the global markets our business outlook remains strong based on our business model strong financials diligent expense management and acquisition strategy in addition consumer demand for electronics has been solid particularly the demand for mobile devices through our recent acquisitions we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market especially in ip and systemlevel solutions which we believe will help drive revenue growth we believe that the combination of our solid financials leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us to continue to successfully execute our strategies 

fiscal 2012 acquisitions 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we completed our acquisition of magma design automation inc magma and during the fourth quarter we completed our acquisition of emulation  

  

verification engineering sa eve and acquired a controlling interest in springsoft inc springsoft as further described below these acquisitions combined with other acquisitions in fiscal 2012 were the primary drivers for increases in revenues and expenses compared to fiscal 2011 

fiscal year end 

our fiscal year generally ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks with the exception that approximately every five years we have a 53week year when a 53week year occurs we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters fiscal 2012 was a 53week year and ended on november 3 2012 fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were 52week years ending on october 29 2011 and october 30 2010 respectively 

the extra week in fiscal 2012 resulted in approximately 26 million of additional revenue related primarily to timebased licenses and approximately 16 million of additional expenses 

for presentation purposes this form 10k refers to october 31 as the end of our fiscal year 

fiscal 2012 financial performance summary 

increases in our revenue and expenses were driven by the overall growth of our business including from our acquisitions in fiscal 2012 in addition the extra week in fiscal 2012 contributed to increases in our revenue and expenses 

 

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “results of operations” below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with gaap in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 

   

  

  

 revenue recognition 

software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees hardware revenue consists of field programmable gate array fpga boardbased products 

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

 

  

  

 for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

 

  

  

 we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent 

  

revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs such revenue is reported as “timebased revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations historically these arrangements have not been material to our total revenue 

we recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these hardware sales is reported as “upfront revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations hardware sales have not been material to our total revenue 

we infrequently enter into multipleelement arrangements that contain both software and nonsoftware deliverables such as hardware on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we applied accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to these contracts such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect on subsequent periods 

we have determined that the software and nonsoftware deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting accordingly we allocate the arrangement consideration to separate units of accounting based on estimated standalone selling prices esp because we do not have objective evidence of standalone selling prices we estimate the standalone selling prices of our separate units of accounting considering both market conditions and our own specific conditions for hardware deliverables we determine esp using gross margin because we have consistent pricing practices and gross margins for these products determining the esp for software deliverables requires significant judgment we determine esp for software deliverables after considering customer geographies market demand and competition at the time of contract negotiation gross margin objectives existing portfolio pricing practices contractually stated prices and prices for similar historical transactions 

we recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized according to the methods described above depending on the software license type tsl term license or perpetual license 

we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that contain only software and software related deliverables based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services as 

  

services are performed and accepted by the customer we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 

we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

 

  

  

  

 valuation of stock compensation 

stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with asc 718 stock compensation  we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards the blackscholes optionpricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility expected term and riskfree 

  

interest rates we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards we determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience in addition judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends these input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 

valuation of intangible assets 

we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customerrelationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete capitalized software development and other intangibles factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

income taxes 

our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 3110 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2012 will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

we apply a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

  

the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a small extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times in most instances we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered the average license term of the tsls and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 was 27 years 28 years and 29 years respectively revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development revenue on hardware product orders are generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs 

revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally one year revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer 

our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront maintenance and professional services and hardware revenue for the period we derive timebased license revenue in any quarter largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software and not when they are booked our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters conversely a 120000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees and 100 of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on 

  

all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

 

 our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals 

the sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012 was due to overall growth of our business including contributions of revenue from acquired companies the increases were primarily in the timebased license revenue fiscal 2012 had approximately 26 million of additional revenue due to the additional week in the fiscal year 

timebased license revenue 

 

 the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to increases in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods and from the contracts acquired through fiscal 2012 acquisitions and to a lesser extent due to higher contingent revenue product sales the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2012 and other timebased arrangements 

the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to increases in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods higher contingent revenue from royalties and product sales from prioryear acquisitions 

upfront revenue 

 

 changes in upfront revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the sequential increase in upfront revenue from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses 

  

maintenance and service revenue 

 

 changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of renewals and the type of contracts renewed on maintenance contracts maintenance revenue was relatively flat during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 

professional services and other revenue increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to a higher level of consulting services 

professional services and other revenue increased substantially in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to professional services contracts assumed from prior acquisitions 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

 

 our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnelrelated costs including salaries benefits stock compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities amortization of intangible assets and depreciation as well as due to an additional week during the fiscal year we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool consequently fluctuations in these drivers impact the amounts allocated to each functional area 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

  

cost of revenue 

 

 we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of license revenue cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to third party vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization and costs associated with the delivery of our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of certain contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions 

cost of revenue increased by 522 million or 15 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to increases of 265 million in amortization of intangible assets 190 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of fiscal 2012 acquisitions and the impact of one extra week of costs of approximately 22 million in fiscal 2012 

cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in professional service revenue the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in 169 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases from our prioryear acquisitions an increase of 189 million in costs to provide maintenance and professional services an increase of 23 million in hardware and license costs and an increase of 187 million for amortization of intangible assets due to our prioryear acquisitions 

  

operating expenses 

research and development 

 

 the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases of 610 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions 111 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases from our current year acquisitions 79 million in costs related to acquisitions and one extra week of costs of approximately 75 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase of 318 million in personnelrelated costs and an increase of 119 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases from our prioryear acquisitions 

sales and marketing 

 

 changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was due to increases in personnelrelated costs of 256 million primarily driven by headcount increases from our acquisitions 112 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments 89 million in costs related to acquisitions and one extra week of costs of approximately 49 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase of 106 million in commissions and other variable compensation an increase of 96 million in other personnelrelated costs due to an increase in headcount from prioryear acquisitions and an increase of 27 million in travelrelated costs 

general and administrative 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases of 159 million in personnelrelated costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions 245 million in costs related to acquisitions 68 million in facility expenses 58 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses and one extra week of costs of approximately 16 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 the increases were partially offset by a higher allocation of 180 million in expenses to other functions in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of increased expenses in the allocation pool 

  

the decrease in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease of 138 million resulting from higher allocation of expenses to other functional areas because of increased headcount this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 33 million in personnelrelated costs 61 million in facility expenses and 29 million in other general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of our prioryear acquisitions 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income expense net these assets are classified as trading securities there is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset 

acquired inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd costs relate to inprocess technologies acquired in acquisitions the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology the successful development of the iprd its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at the time of determination 

upon completion of development the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue iprd projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition iprd projects of 33 million were completed during fiscal 2012 see note 3 and note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in current and prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 

 

 amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

the increases in amortization of intangible assets from fiscal 2010 through 2012 was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts which is incorporated by reference here 

impairment of intangible assets we did not record any impairment charges to our intangible assets during fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

  

other income expense net 

 

 the net increase in other income expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in gain on assets related to our deferred compensation plan and an increase in premiums on hedge contracts included in other income expense net partially offset by higher interest expense due to a term loan that we entered into in 2012 

the net decrease in other income expense net in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in gain on assets related to our deferred compensation plan a decrease in gains on sale of investments included other income expense net and lower interest rates this decrease was partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations 

income taxes 

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2012 and 2011 include tax benefits of settlements with the irs of 159 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2011 with taiwan of 147m net tax benefit resulting from the 2008 settlement being applied to other open fiscal years with hungary of 63 million for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 in fiscal year 2012 and a settlement with the irs of 328 million for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 in fiscal 2011 without the impact of the settlements the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 and 2011 would have been 277 and 139 respectively for further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements see note 10 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 

as of october 31 2012 we held an aggregate of 1980 million in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of 5024 million in our foreign subsidiaries funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are generated from revenue outside north america at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings during the current year we primarily used our cash in foreign subsidiaries to fund our overseas acquisitions of springsoft and eve in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund cash needs in the united states and if us taxes have not already been previously accrued we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2012 

  

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

 our cash generated from operating activities was 4861 million in fiscal 2012 during fiscal 2012 we liquidated our shortterm investments primarily to fund our acquisitions 

other cash activities were 1 payments for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 9701 million 2 net proceeds from sales and purchases of shortterm investments of 1480 million 3 proceeds from a credit facility and term loan of 2500 million and subsequent repayment of 1150 million of those loans 4 share repurchases of 400 million offset by proceeds from employee stock plans of 1759 million and 5 purchases of property and equipment of 542 million 

cash flows 

 

 cash provided by operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront revenue much sooner than from timebased license revenue in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors 

fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities increased due to fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulting from increased accounts receivable collections due to timing of billings offset partly by higher payments due to disbursements to vendors higher variable compensation costs and higher personnelrelated costs due to increased headcount as well as increased tax payments  

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2012 partly offset by net proceeds from the purchase and sale of investments 

  

fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 the decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily relates to lower cash payments for acquisitions in 2011 offset by lower net proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments and higher property and equipment purchases see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 the increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to net proceeds from credit facilities obtained primarily to finance our acquisitions and less common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program 

fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 the increase in cash used relates to common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and accelerated stock repurchase asr program including cash paid for an equity forward contract as part of the asr program partially offset by higher proceeds from issuances of common stock 

accounts receivable net 

 

 our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 59 days at october 31 2012 and 47 days at october 31 2011 the increase in dso is attributable to the receivables acquired through our acquisitions and the timing of billings at the end of fiscal 2012 

working capital working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

 changes in our working capital were primarily due to 1 a 3037 million decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments used to fund our fiscal 2012 acquisitions 2 an 895 million increase in accounts receivable 3 a 1313 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of our billings 4 an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 809 million 5 an increase of 300 million in shortterm debt obligations from our new term loan and 6 a net 167 million increase due to movements in other current assets and taxrelated assets 

other 

as of october 31 2012 our cash equivalents consisted of cash deposits taxexempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 

we proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents and investments balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our global excess cash and our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio invested in banks and securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding 

  

aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see notes 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

other commitments 

on february 17 2012 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders the “credit agreement” providing for i a 3500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolver” and ii a 1500 million senior unsecured term loan facility the “term loan” the credit agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated october 14 2011 in order to add a new term loan facility primarily to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of magma on february 22 2012 subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional 1500 million through october 13 2015 the credit agreement terminates on october 14 2016 the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement at october 31 2012 borrowings under the revolver bore interest at libor  0975 and borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor  1125 in addition commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0150 and 0300 per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment during fiscal 2012 we borrowed 2500 million under the credit agreement as of october 31 2012 we had no outstanding balance under the revolver and a 1350 million outstanding balance under the term loan and are in compliance with all covenants 1050 million of the borrowings under the term loan are classified as long term principal payments on a portion of the term loan are due in equal quarterly installments of 75 million beginning in the third quarter of our fiscal 2012 with the remainder due in october 2016 we can elect to make prepayments on the term loan in whole or in part without premium or penalty during fiscal 2012 we made principal payments of 1000 million and 150 million under the revolver and term loan respectively we had no outstanding debt balances as of october 31 2011 we expect the borrowings under the revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 

contractual obligations

as of october 31 2011 

 

 foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2012 the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 93 million and we would be required to pay approximately 93 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 93 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized loss of approximately 13 million and loss of approximately 128 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2012 and october 31 2011 respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

  

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2012 

 

 the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2011 

 

   

equity risk our strategic investment portfolio consists of approximately 117 million and 40 million of nonmarketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31 2012 and october 31 2011 respectively these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value during fiscal 2012 and 2011 we wrote down the value of our strategic investment portfolio by 05 million and 10 million respectively none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes

background 

the proliferation of consumer and wireless products the growth of the internet and the development of higher speed computers and more robust visual communication systems as well as the increasing electronics content in automotive defense and other applications has created demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance reduced size and less power consumption at lower prices these demands as well as evershortening timetomarket requirements introduce challenges for all participants in the production of these products from designers and manufacturers of chips and electronic systems to equipment manufacturers 

it is not uncommon for a single chip to contain many discrete sections processor communications memory custom logic inputoutput that may have been implemented on separate chips in previous generations this combination of many chips into a single systemonchip soc results in highly complex designs the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors the basic building blocks for integrated circuits each of which may have features that are less than 11000th the diameter of a human hair 

the designer’s task is to determine where each of those billion transistors should be located and how they should be connected to each other verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and ensure that the design can be manufactured costeffectively this task is a complicated multistep process which is both expensive and timeconsuming errors can be especially costly 

synopsys provides the software tools hardware and other technologies to help designers of complex integrated circuits and systems we offer a wide range of products that address the different 

  

steps in the overall design process both for the design of individual integrated circuits and for the design of larger systems synopsys products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks keeping track of large amounts of design data adding intelligence to the design process facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers

product warranties 

we generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for our software products and for up to six months for our hardware products in certain cases we also provide our customers with limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of our software products infringe on united states patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets we have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date although we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 

support for industry standards 

we actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity facilitate efficient design flows improve interoperability of tools from different vendors and ensure connectivity 

  

functionality and interoperability of ip building blocks standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations from industry consortia by company licensing made available to all from de facto usage or through open source licensing 

synopsys’ products support more than 60 standards including the most commonly used hardware description languages systemverilog verilog vhdl and systemc our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats application programming interfaces and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools other eda vendors’ products and applications that customers develop internally we also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our ip product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity 

sales distribution and backlog 

we market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media ie cdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain salessupport centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain sales support or service offices in canada multiple countries in europe israel japan and other countries in asia our foreign headquarters is located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties  

in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 an aggregate of 52 51 and 50 respectively of synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is included herein 

synopsys’ backlog was approximately 24 billion on october 31 2010 representing a 9 increase from backlog of 22 billion on october 31 2009 this increase resulted primarily from the timing of large contract renewals and backlog acquired from the various acquisitions which occurred in fiscal 2010 and to a lesser extent by the strength of the japanese yen in fiscal 2010 backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or default on their payment obligations for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our four common groupings or platforms established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years 

 

 revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for 109 108 and 108 of our total revenue in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and integrate our design and verification platforms and to expand our manufacturing ip and systemlevel product offerings research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses were 4492 million 4199 million and 3947 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 29 million 30 million and 30 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms postcontract customer support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms 

our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services primarily cadence design systems inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities in the ip area we compete primarily with our customers’ internally developed ip no one factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in many cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations — revenue background  

  

we typically license our designware core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties 

finally our global technical services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 

proprietary rights 

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 1200 patents issued our issued patents have expiration dates through 2030 our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future we are not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license with respect to our proprietary rights 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights for example we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it

 item 1a risk factors tableend we describe our risk factors below 

our operating results may fluctuate in the future which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our stock price our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations many factors may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate including 

 

   

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors or any other factors or risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue and earnings and cause our stock price to decline 

the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 

the growth of the eda industry as a whole and our business in particular is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics and customers’ concerns about managing costs have in recent periods led to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process if these trends continue demand for our products and services could fall and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected additionally as the eda industry matures industry consolidation has caused increased levels of competition for a greater share of our customers’ eda spending this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years including the acquisitions of coware inc vast systems technology corporation and virage logic corporation to increase revenue and expand our product offerings and we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future achieving the potential financial or 

  

technological benefits from these transactions is difficult and time consuming and the integration of these acquisitions poses a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not manage these risks the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition for instance if we are unable to successfully integrate the products and technology from our recent acquisition of virage logic we may not be able achieve the anticipated revenue growth from this transaction additionally if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets which would harm our operating results 

the continued uncertainty in the global economy and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

as a result of the recent major global recession the global economy continues to experience significant uncertainty stock market volatility tightened credit markets concerns about both deflation and inflation reduced demand for products lower consumer confidence reduced capital spending liquidity concerns and business insolvencies these declines and uncertainty about future economic conditions could continue to negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business 

the recent global recession adversely affected the semiconductor industry semiconductor companies generally remain cautious and focused on their costs including in their research and development budgets out of which spending on eda products and services occurs these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

under our business model we generally expect more than 90 of our total revenue to be recurring revenue as a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a threeyear period however the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions have caused some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us continued periods of decreased committed average annual revenue additional customer bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers could adversely affect our yearoveryear revenue growth 

  

the recent global recession also adversely affected the banking and financial industry if the global economy continues to experience uncertainty our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms could be jeopardized furthermore we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts provide credit and provide banking transactions and deposit services worldwide should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations it could adversely affect our financial results and our business 

we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of the global economic downturn or any subsequent recovery so our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty and our stock price is at risk of volatile change if economic conditions further deteriorate or fail to significantly improve for any extended period of time or in particular if semiconductor industry revenues do not grow our future revenues and financial results will be adversely affected conversely in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 

if we do not successfully compete in the eda industry our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services primarily cadence design systems inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process moreover our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products 

the demand for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints in addition our customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their eda purchases with one vendor we compete principally on the basis of technology product quality and features including easeofuse license or usage terms postcontract customer support interoperability among products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 

  

  

  

 if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors or if we fail to address new competitive forces our business will be harmed 

consolidation in the eda industry may negatively impact our operating results 

the eda industry in recent years has been subject to increased consolidation we expect this trend to continue as companies within the industry attempt to increase or maintain market share by complimenting or expanding product offerings or as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations industry consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies that are better 

  

able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to fewer customers or the loss of one or more major customers which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach additionally some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited our trade secrets may also otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

  

  

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

changes in accounting principles or standards or in the way they are applied could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and could adversely affect our reported operating results 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance a change in these principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results additionally proposed accounting standards could have a significant impact on our operational processes revenues and expenses and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our acquisitions our entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline additionally our research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

unfavorable tax law changes an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business such as an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense currently a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries on may 5 2009 and february 1 2010 the president of the united states and the us treasury department proposed changing certain us tax rules for us corporations doing business outside the united states specific legislation has not yet been proposed or enacted but it is possible that these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our us income tax liability in the future on august 10 2010 the education jobs and medicaid assistance act of 2010 pl 111226 was enacted which may limit our ability to use foreign tax credits on transactions we enter into after fiscal 2010 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain examinations of our federal tax returns for the years 20002001 and 20022004 by the irs resulted in significant proposed adjustments which were subsequently settled we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates therefore any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of or amendments to foreign tax rulings could materially increase our effective tax rate 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations which may adversely affect our business 

we derive approximately half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks including 

 

  

  

  

   

 

  

  

 if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

in addition our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance imports and exports financial and other disclosures privacy and labor relations these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our operating results are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations can be adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies as a result of the translation of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the us dollar exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business results of operations and financial condition although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk if foreign currency exchange rates deteriorate our operating results would be adversely affected by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside of the united states 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 

under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim to be without merit and are vigorously defending against it however there can be no assurances that we will prevail these types of claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or 

  

perception of our products in addition allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results 

the majority of our revenue backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered a significant portion of the revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash from customers we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default declare bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed moreover existing customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses our customers’ financial condition and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations could be adversely affected by current economic conditions if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments our operating results would be harmed 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 

we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team our business could be adversely affected 

to be successful we must also attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees would harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure from stockholders who must approve any increases in our equity pool to limit the use of such equitybased compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders in addition we are required under us gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee sharebased equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit sharebased compensation these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive sharebased packages in the future which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

  

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulated organizations including the sec the nasdaq global market and the financial accounting standards board these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain for example on july 21 2010 congress passed the doddfrank wall street reform and protection act our efforts to comply with the doddfrank act and other new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could have a material adverse impact on our business 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part 1 of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

synopsys is a world leader in providing technology solutions used to develop electronics and electronic systems we supply the eda software that engineers use to design create prototypes for and test integrated circuits also known as chips we also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits our ip products are predesigned circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves to complement these product offerings we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems 

our customers are generally large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be impacted by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs the recent global recession intensified the cost and investment challenges for our customers 

despite the recent global recession we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technology and strong customer relationships but also because of our recurring revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this recurring revenue over the life of the contract which averages approximately three years recurring revenue generally represents more than 90 of our total revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period we typically enter each quarter with greater than 90 of our revenue for that particular quarter already committed from our customers providing for stability and predictability of results 

although our customers in the semiconductor industry generally have experienced revenue growth in 2010 they still remain cautious and focused on their costs including in their research and development budgets in addition increased spending by our customers with us may not immediately affect our revenue results due to our revenue business model 

while we are still cautious about the magnitude and sustainability of an economic recovery our business outlook is positive given our strong financials diligent expense management and acquisition strategy in fiscal 2010 we completed eight acquisitions for total cash of approximately 5008 million net of cash acquired through our acquisitions we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market especially in ip and systemlevel solutions we expect to continue to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities including acquiring companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic operational and financial performance of our business we will also continue to monitor market conditions and may make adjustments to our business in the event that the recent revenue growth experienced by the semiconductor industry is 

  

irregular or not sustained we believe that the combination of our solid financials leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies 

fiscal 2010 financial performance summary 

 

  

  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “results of operations” below are based on our audited results of operations which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 

  

  

  

 revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue and to a lesser extent from hardware sales in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees hardware revenue consists of field programmable gate array fpga boardbased products 

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

 

   

 

  

 for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

 

  

  

 we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements we refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue” contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs it is reported as “timebased revenue” in the consolidated statement of operations these arrangements were not material to our total revenue 

we recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these hardware sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statement of operations except in the event that a technology subscription license is sold together with the hardware in that event we recognize total revenue ratably over the term of the software license period or as customer installments become due and payable whichever is later and revenue attributable to such hardware sales is reported as “timebased license revenue” in the consolidated statement of operations hardware sales were not material to our total revenue 

we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer revenue 

  

attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statement of operations 

we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification or customization of the software we account for such arrangements per the guidance provided in asc 60535  constructiontype and productiontype contracts  we use the percentage of completion method to account for such transactions as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion contract revenues and costs we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project 

our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately 

we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and we recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed or as milestones are met and accepted we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 

we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

 

  

  

   

  

 valuation of stock compensation 

stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with asc 718 stock compensation  we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards the blackscholes optionpricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility expected term and riskfree interest rates we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards we determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience in addition judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends these input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 

valuation of intangible assets 

we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customerinstalled baserelationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete customer backlog capitalized software development and other intangibles factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2010 

  

income taxes 

our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 3420 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2010 will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

we apply a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings 

results of operations 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest october 31 in fiscal year 2010 the saturday nearest october 31 was october 30 2010 our fiscal years are generally 52week years although periodically we have one extra week in our fiscal year that occurs in the first quarter fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were 52week years 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a small extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times in most instances we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered substantially all of our current timebased licenses are tsls with an average license term of approximately three years revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally one year revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones revenues on contracts requiring significant modification or development are accounted for using the percentage 

  

of completion method over the period of the development revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time when the product is shipped 

our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront license maintenance and professional service and hardware revenue for the period we derive timebased license revenue in any quarter largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional service revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted not when they are booked our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters conversely perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg a 120000 order for a perpetual license generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees is payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

total revenue 

 

 our revenues are subject to fluctuations primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms the timing of contract renewals and bookings associated with our acquisitions foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to higher upfront license revenue of 111 million and timebased license revenue of 79 million the fluctuations in revenue for each type of revenue are explained below 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to bookings in prior years including bookings with new products and features obtained through acquisitions leading to increased current period timebased license revenue 

  

beginning in fiscal 2010 we included contingent revenue as timebased revenue as a result 119 million and 142 million in contingent revenue were reclassified from upfront license revenue to timebased license revenue in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively to conform to fiscal 2010 presentation this reclassification had no impact on total revenue 

timebased license revenue 

 

 the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the increase in contingent revenue from royalties received and recognized in fiscal 2010 

the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the result of more revenue recognized in fiscal 2009 from licenses booked in prior periods in which revenue is recognized as customer installment payments become due and payable the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from tsls as a result of factors relating to the economic turmoil and uncertainty including several customer bankruptcies in fiscal 2009 

upfront license revenue 

 

 the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to higher customer demand in hardware and ip perpetual license requirements which drives the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the upfront license revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 slightly increased primarily due to normal fluctuations in customer license requirements which drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

maintenance and service revenue 

 

   

maintenance revenue decreased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the timing and the type of contracts renewed on maintenance contracts 

maintenance revenue increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the recognition of a full year of maintenance revenue for the products related to our acquisition in fiscal 2008 

professional services and other revenue increased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase in recognition of professional services from customer contracts acquired through acquisition offset by a decrease in consulting contracts completed in fiscal 2010 

professional services and other revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to decrease in customer demand in fiscal 2009 and the timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing consulting contracts 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

 

 our expenses are generally impacted by changes in employee related costs including salaries benefits stock compensation and variable compensation changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and due to an increase in commission expense driven by higher shipments furthermore beginning in fiscal 2010 acquisitionrelated costs such as severance contract terminations professional service fees and other directly related costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as required by new accounting standards prior to fiscal 2010 such costs were recorded as purchase consideration 

we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool consequently fluctuations in these drivers impact the amounts allocated to each functional area 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 

  

cost of revenue 

 

 we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of license revenue cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs royalties paid to third party vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization and costs associated with the delivery of our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets which is amortized to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain contracts and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions 

cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 20 for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an increase of 34 million in intangibles amortization primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions an increase of 11 million in travel related costs an increase of 11 million in other direct costs and an increase of 16 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described 

cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased 1 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase of 57 million in employee related costs primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions and an increase in fair value of 24 million in our deferred compensation plan obligation the increase was partially offset by a decrease in travel related costs of 41 million 

  

operating expenses 

research and development 

 

 the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an increase of 79 million in personnel related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions 78 million in acquisitionrelated costs an increase of 24 million in stock compensation expense an increase of 39 million in other research and development expenses and an increase of 86 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 14 million in depreciation expense 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase of 48 million in employee related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions an increase of 166 million in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation and an increase of 60 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described the increase was partially offset by a decrease of 41 million in travel related costs 

sales and marketing 

 

 the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to an increase of 189 million in commissions other variable compensation and employee related costs an increase of 34 million in acquisitionrelated costs and an increase of 11 million in travel related costs the increase in commissions and other variable compensation was primarily driven by higher shipments during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was partially offset by a decrease of 80 million of other sales and marketing expense including consulting marketing and communications 

the decrease in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to a decrease of 177 million in variable compensation and employee related costs and a decrease of 63 million in travel related costs the decrease in variable compensation was primarily driven by lower shipments the decrease was partially offset by the increase of 81 million in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation and 65 million of other sales and marketing expense 

general and administrative 

 

   

the decrease in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a reduction of 34 million in bad debt expense based on our review of customer receivables a decrease of 79 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described and a decrease in expense due to a 45 million restructuring charge related to a facility closure recorded in fiscal 2009 these decreases were offset by an increase of 93 million in acquisitionrelated costs and an increase of 30 million in facilities expense primarily due to our acquisitions 

the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to 51 million in facility relocation expenses in fiscal 2009 including a 45 million restructuring charge related to a facility closure an increase of 47 million in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation an increase of 23 million in bad debt reserve based on our review of customer receivables and an increase of 27 million in depreciation expense 

change in fair value of deferred compensation 

the income or loss due to the change in fair value of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense the offsetting income or loss due to the change in fair value of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan asset is recorded in other income loss net as the assets are classified as trading securities the overall net impact to our consolidated statements of operations from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset is immaterial for all periods presented 

the yearoveryear effect of the fair value change was an increase of 05 million in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 correspondingly the decrease in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan asset was approximately 12 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

the yearoveryear effect of the fair value change was an increase of 317 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 correspondingly the increase in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan asset was approximately 331 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 this change was a result of the better performing financial markets in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

acquired inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd costs relate to inprocess technologies acquired in acquisitions the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology the successful development of the iprd its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at the time of determination 

effective for fiscal 2010 upon adoption of new accounting guidance asc 805 business combinations acquired iprd in fiscal 2010 has been capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and is assessed for impairment in subsequent periods upon completion of development the underlying rd intangible asset will be amortized over its estimated useful life prior to the adoption iprd was expensed upon acquisition if it had no alternative future use iprd expense was 22 million for fiscal 2009 and 48 million for fiscal 2008 acquired iprd projects are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 

 

 amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table as it is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions in fiscal 2010 offset by certain intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to addition of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions in fiscal 2009 offset by certain intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized 

see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts which information is included herein 

impairment of intangible assets we did not record any impairment charges to the intangible assets during fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 

other income loss net 

 

 the decrease in other income loss net in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations lower interest rates and a decrease in income on deferred 

  

compensation plan this decrease was partially offset by an increase from gains on sales of investments see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for our employee benefit plans 

the increase in other income loss net in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in income on our deferred compensation plan see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for our employee benefit plans the increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates 

income taxes 

see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 

we hold our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the us and in foreign accounts primarily in ireland bermuda and japan as of october 31 2010 we held an aggregate of 2531 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the us and an aggregate of 6855 million in foreign accounts funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings 

the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2010 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

 we generated strong cash flows from operating activities during the last three quarters of fiscal 2010 our cash generated from operating activities was 3410 million in fiscal 2010 net payments for acquisitions were 5008 million during fiscal 2010 

other cash activities were 1 share repurchases of 1847 million partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock of 1453 million 2 net proceeds from sales and purchases of investments of 3042 million and 3 purchases of property and equipment of 392 million 

  

cash flows 

 

 cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from timebased license revenue in contrast payment terms for tsls are generally extended and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license 

we expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions 

fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 cash from operating activities increased primarily as a result of increased cash received from customers due to timing of billings lower bonuses commissions vendor payments and lower income tax payments due to an irs settlement compared to fiscal 2009 see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 cash from operating activities decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in deferred revenue due to the timing of billings and cash payments from certain customers increased payments to vendors compared to fiscal 2008 and a tax prepayment for an irs settlement see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 the increase in cash used primarily relates to the increase in acquisition activities during fiscal 2010 offset by the sale of certain investments see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 the decrease in cash used primarily relates to a decrease in our purchases of marketable securities and cash paid for acquisitions as compared to fiscal 2008 offset by the timing of maturities of marketable securities 

cash used in provided by financing activities 

fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 the increase in cash used primarily related to the common stock repurchases resumed in fiscal 2010 offset by an increase in the number of options exercised by employees compared to fiscal 2009 

fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 the increase in cash provided primarily relates to the absence of common stock repurchases in fiscal 2009 offset by a decrease in the number of options exercised by employees compared to fiscal 2008 

  

accounts receivable net 

 

 our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 44 days at october 31 2010 and 34 days at october 31 2009 the increase in dso along with an increase in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to our acquisitions in the last quarter of fiscal 2010 

working capital working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

 the primary drivers of changes in our working capital were 1 a 2298 million decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as explained above 2 a 328 million decrease in income tax receivable primarily from an irs settlement recorded in fiscal 2010 3 a 578 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and 4 a 466 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of our billings the decreases were partially offset by a 541 million increase in accounts receivable net of allowances as explained above 

other commitments —credit facility on october 20 2006 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to us and certain of our foreign subsidiaries the amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional 1500 million through the fourth year of the facility the facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants the facility terminates on october 20 2011 borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 however we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 050 and 070 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant in addition commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0125 and 0175 per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant as of october 31 2010 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants 

as a result of an acquisition in fiscal 2009 we assumed two credit facilities as of october 31 2009 these facilities were cancelled and the borrowings outstanding paid down 

other 

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio as of october 31 2010 consists of investment grade municipal bonds taxexempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as of october 31 2010 we had no direct holdings in structured 

  

investment vehicles subprime mortgagebacked securities or collateralized debt obligations and no exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 we had no impairment charge associated with our shortterm investment portfolio while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity we have taken steps including regularly reviewing our investments and associated risk profiles which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio 

as a result of the challenging conditions in the financial markets we have been more proactively managing our cash and cash equivalents and investments and closely monitoring our capital and stock repurchase expenditures additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio invested in securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements  

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2010 

 

  

    in connection with acquisitions completed prior to october 31 2010 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 49 million in cash during fiscal 2011 54 million during fiscal 2012 and 33 million during fiscal 2013 if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved because these 

  

commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals these amounts are not reflected in the table above 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2010 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31 2010 

 

 as of october 31 2010 the stated maturities of our current shortterm investments are 328 million within one year 677 million within one to five years 250 million within five to ten years and 377 million after ten years however we consider these investments to be shortterm in nature because in accordance with our investment policy the weighted average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for shortterm obligations and other uses including acquisitions these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

  

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2010 that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

 

 the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2009 that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

 

 foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for our principal irish hungarian and swiss subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the us dollar we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 19 months a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2010 the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 117 million and we would be required to pay approximately 117 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 117 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

  

net unrealized loss of approximately 64 million and gain of approximately 96 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2010 and october 31 2009 respectively 

if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2010 

 

   

the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2009 

 

 equity risk our strategic investment portfolio consists of approximately 74 million of minority equity investments in privately held companies as of october 31 2010 compared to approximately 98 million of minority equity investments in publicly traded and privately held companies as of october 31 2009 the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value during fiscal 2010 and 2009 we wrote down the value of our strategic investment portfolio by 03 million and 72 million respectively none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes

the role of eda in the electronics industry 

technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily improved the feature density speed power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors also referred to as integrated circuits ics or chips 

 

  

  

 combined these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lowercost higherperformance computers wireless communications networks hand held devices internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices each advance however has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and eda software suppliers such as synopsys 

these technological challenges have been accompanied by significant business challenges increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lowercost areas and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products 

we believe synopsys is well positioned to help our customers meet these multifaceted challenges we have a broad portfolio of solutions that are highly integrated to solve our customers’ most advanced technological problems we have a large number of global service and support engineers that help our customers complete their chip designs we believe our combination of advanced technology and global scale along with our solid business execution gives us a competitive advantage 

the ic design process 

eda software enables designers to create complex semiconductors in simplified form the ic design process consists of the steps described below 

system design the first step in a typical ic design is determining the features and specifications of the chip its overall architecture and the division of device functionality between hardware and software once the architecture is created and the division between hardware and software made software engineers develop the embedded software applications that drive an increasing proportion of the device functionality while the chip designers develop the functionality and configuration of the semiconductor itself 

register transfer level rtl design rtl design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level computer language typically systemverilog verilog or vhdl 

  

logic design logic design or “synthesis” programs convert the rtl code into a logical diagram of the chip and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors or gates to be built on the chip 

functional verification at the rtl level of ic design the designer uses functional verification tools such as rtl simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended the increasing size and complexity of today’s ics and socs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs with verification estimated to consume 60 to 70 of total design time as a result designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds and that can reduce verification risk ie find design bugs before designs are taken into production 

rapid prototyping rapid prototyping is a form of functional verification that uses hardware to accelerate verification in order to accommodate these significant demands it is also used to accelerate the development of embedded software by software engineers by essentially providing a “prototype” of the chip well before the chip is completed—allowing software development to begin many months earlier than would otherwise be the case 

physical design in the physical design stage the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with “place and route” products the designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip as well as the location for each transistor within each block a process known as “placement” in many designs placement is performed in conjunction with logic synthesis a process known as “physical synthesis” after placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors a process known as “routing” with increasing gate counts and design complexity seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important 

physical verification before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication the designer must perform a series of further verification steps checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip 

manufacturing the design is then translated to a series of photomasks or physical representations of the design ic manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ics as ic wire or “feature” sizes shrink this translation is becoming more and more difficult these challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced technology computeraided design or tcad tools are also used to model individual features or “devices” within the design to help ensure manufacturability finally various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ics contained on each silicon wafer 

intellectual property reuse as ic designs continue to grow in size and complexity designers have found that inserting predesigned and preverified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified usually such ip blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ics including microprocessors digital signal processors or connectivity ip that support such protocols as usb pci express or ethernet

with increasing chip complexity designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially and must repeat some steps such as verification multiple times before finishing the design each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet timetomarket goals synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next 

  

in addition smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before synopsys has invested heavily in manufacturingrelated technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield 

also many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed we offer systemlevel products that permit designers to develop such software earlier in the ic design process speeding overall development time 

in addition designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition we address this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality preverified standardsbased and other ip which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence 

finally designers rely on assistance from eda engineers to help them complete their chips on time and with high quality we help customers with both design services and application engineer support 

our strategy is to help our customers get their products to market quickly and efficiently in order to remain at the leading edge of technology development we believe it is important to continually invest in research and development as well as targeted acquisitions we also believe that offering customer support on a global basis is instrumental to addressing our customers’ needs

customer service and technical support 

a high level of customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products we provide technical support for our products through both fieldbased and corporatebased application engineering teams customers who purchase technology subscription licenses tsls receive software maintenance services bundled with their license fee customers who purchase term licenses and perpetual licenses may purchase these services separately see product sales and licensing agreements below 

software maintenance services include minor product enhancements bug fixes and access to our technical support center for primary support software maintenance also includes access to solvnet our webbased support solution that gives customers access to synopsys’ complete design knowledge database updated daily solvnet includes documentation design tips and answers to user questions customers can also engage for additional charges our worldwide network of applications consultants for additional support needs 

in addition synopsys also offers training workshops designed to increase customer design proficiency and productivity with our products workshops cover synopsys products and methodologies used in our design and verification flows as well as specialized modules addressing system design logic design physical design simulation and test we offer regularly scheduled public and private courses in a variety of locations worldwide as well as virtual classroom ondemand and live online training 

product warranties 

we generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for our software products and for up to one year for our hardware products we also typically provide our customers limited indemnities with respect to claims that their use of our design 

  

and verification software products infringe on united states patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets we have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date although we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 

support for industry standards 

we actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity facilitate efficient design flows improve interoperability of tools from different vendors and ensure connectivity functionality and interoperability of ip building blocks standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations from industry consortia by company licensing made available to all from de facto usage or through open source licensing 

synopsys’ products support more than 60 standards including the most commonly used hardware description languages systemverilog verilog vhdl and systemc our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats application programming interfaces and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools other eda vendors’ products and applications that customers develop internally we also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our ip product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity 

sales distribution and backlog 

we market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media ie cdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain salessupport centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain sales support or service offices in canada multiple countries in europe israel japan and other countries in asia our foreign headquarters is located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties  

in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 an aggregate of 51 50 and 50 respectively of synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is included herein 

synopsys’ aggregate backlog was approximately 22 billion on october 31 2009 representing a 15 decrease from aggregate backlog of 26 billion on october 31 2008 this decrease was primarily due to the timing of large contract renewals and to a lesser extent the removal of under 50 million in 2009 backlog due to customer bankruptcies during the year aggregate backlog represents the portion of committed orders that has not yet been recognized as revenue we expect backlog to fluctuate from year to year for several reasons including specific timing and duration of large customer agreements and the schedule of when portions of that backlog are recognized as revenue as an illustration for a single customer contract associated backlog is high at the beginning of a renewable contract low just prior to renewal of the contract and high again when the contract is renewed low backlog attributable to a particular contract is typically associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer accordingly we expect aggregate backlog to fluctuate from year to year depending upon the number and dollar amount of contracts at particular stages in their renewal cycle and such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future sales furthermore backlog particularly longerterm backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements for this and other reasons we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated 

  

the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our four common groupings or platforms established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years we include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods for presentation purposes we allocate maintenance revenue which represented approximately 6 5 and 6 of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively to the products to which those support services related 

 

 revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for 108 108 and 111 of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms and to expand our manufacturing ip and systemlevel product offerings research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group we also look to targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts 

our research and development expenses excluding capitalized software development costs were 4199 million 3947 million and 3792 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our capitalized software development costs were approximately 30 million 30 million and 23 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms postcontract customer support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms 

our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services primarily cadence design systems inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with other eda vendors including continual new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities no one factor drives an eda customer’s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budget 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

  

in many cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations — revenue background  

with respect to our designware core intellectual property products we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties 

finally our global technical services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project 

proprietary rights 

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights we have a diversified portfolio of more than 900 patents issued our issued patents have expiration dates through 2026 our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future we are not significantly dependent upon any single patent copyright trademark or license with respect to our proprietary rights 

in many cases under our customer agreements and other license agreements we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights for example we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it

 item 1a risk factors tableend we describe our business risk factors below 

the recent global recession and continued uncertainty in the global economy and weakness in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

the global economy has recently experienced a major recession stock market volatility tightened credit markets concerns about both deflation and inflation reduced demand for products lower consumer confidence reduced capital spending liquidity concerns and business insolvencies these declines and uncertainty about future economic conditions could continue to negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of the global economic downturn or any subsequent recovery so our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty and our stock price is at risk of volatile change 

in addition the eda industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global recession ongoing efforts by semiconductor and electronics companies to reduce spending uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health of various economies around the world excess eda tool capacity and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

if general economic conditions and particularly conditions in the semiconductor and electronics industries do not improve our business financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 

in the event that downward fluctuations in the semiconductor or electronics industries or general economic conditions persist or worsen for any extended period of time or fail to significantly improve our revenues and financial results will be adversely affected 

a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a period of time generating recurring revenue for us generally over a threeyear period under our business model we generally expect more than 90 of our total revenue to be recurring revenue historically shortterm fluctuations in industry or general economic conditions or in orders generally do not immediately affect our financial results due to our business model while the electronics semiconductor and eda industries have recently experienced severe weakness and uncertainty due to the downturn in the global economic recession to date our business model has substantially protected our financial results nevertheless our business model and longerterm financial results are not immune from sustained economic downturns the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions have caused some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us continued periods of decreased committed average annual revenue additional customer bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers could adversely affect our yearoveryear revenue growth and could further decrease our backlog 

accordingly if economic conditions further deteriorate or fail to significantly improve for any extended period of time our future revenues and financial results will be adversely affected conversely in the event of future improvement in economic conditions for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results will be deferred due to our business model 

customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results 

the majority of our backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered a significant portion of revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash from customers although customer payment obligations are not cancelable we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default declare bankruptcy or 

  

otherwise fail to pay amounts owed – as occurs from time to time in an economic downturn moreover existing customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses our customers’ financial condition and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations could be adversely affected by current economic conditions if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments our operating results would be harmed 

if we do not successfully compete in the eda industry our business and financial condition will be harmed 

we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services primarily cadence design systems inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with other eda vendors including frequent new entrants to the marketplace that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process as well as with our customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities we compete principally on the basis of technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse license terms postcontract customer support interoperability with our products and other vendors’ products and price and payment terms specifically we believe the following competitive factors affect our success 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition new competitive factors may emerge from time to time if we fail to successfully compete as described above or fail to address new competitive forces our business will be harmed 

lack of growth in new ic design starts industry consolidation and other potentially longterm trends may adversely affect the eda industry including demand for our products and services 

the increasing complexities of socs and ics and customers’ concerns about managing costs and risks have produced the following longterm and potentially negative trends in our industry 

 

  

  

  

 these trends if sustained could harm the eda industry including the demand for our products and services which in turn would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in accounting principles and guidance or their interpretation could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects including changes to our previouslyfiled financial statements which could cause our stock price to decline 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance a change in these principles or guidance or in their interpretations can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results 

we have received a revenue agent’s report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our us taxable income an adverse outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in july 2008 we received a revenue agent’s report in which the internal revenue service irs proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for fiscal 2002 through 2004 of approximately 2362 million 1305 million of which would be a reduction of certain tax credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due in future periods in august 2008 we timely filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we reached a tentative settlement with the examination division of the irs that would resolve this matter the settlement is subject to further review and approval within the federal government including the joint committee on taxation of the us congress which could take several more months final resolution of this matter could take considerable time and may not be finally approved by the government in which case while the company believes it is still adequately provided for regarding this matter there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of this matter could result in significant tax expense and harm our results of operations and financial condition 

  

unfavorable tax law changes an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense currently a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in may 2009 the president of the united states and the us treasury department proposed changing certain of the us tax rules for us corporations doing business outside the united states specific legislation has not yet been proposed or enacted but it is possible that such proposed changes would lessen the benefit of deductions and credits related to income earned outside of the united states and result in the loss of deferral of income tax on earnings of certain of our foreign affiliates all of which could materially increase our effective tax rate and our cash payments of income taxes 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the irs examinations of our federal tax returns for the years 20002001 and 20022004 resulted in significant proposed adjustments although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates therefore any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of or amendments to foreign tax rulings could materially increase our effective tax rate furthermore we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states changes in our forecasts of such future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results 

our revenue and earnings fluctuate and if our financial results fail to meet stockholder expectations our stock price could decline 

many factors may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate including changing customer demand license mix the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold acquisition expenses impairment charges and restructuring charges accordingly stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance 

from time to time we provide projections describing our expected future financial performance in addition financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate future financial performance is difficult to predict downward adjustments of our targets or the failure to meet our targets or the expectations of research analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter include but are not limited to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the failure to meet the semiconductor industry’s demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may harm our financial results 

soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing to address greater complexity semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers at the same time as a general business trend we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our products while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs if we fail to successfully manage these conflicting demands our financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 

we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 

if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 

we may not be able to acquire businesses or technology and we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the business acquisitions or strategic investments we complete which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products 

we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in the past and expect to make additional acquisitions of businesses or technology in the future we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks which could harm our operating results we have acquired a number of companies and technologies in recent years in addition to direct costs acquisitions pose a number of risks including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us an acquisition may not positively affect our future performance if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology we will be required to write down intangible assets associated with the product or technology which would harm our operating results 

conditions of foreign economies foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance 

we derive approximately half of our revenue from sales outside the united states and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states foreign sales are vulnerable to regional and worldwide economic political and health conditions including the effects of international political conflict hostilities and natural disasters further any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states 

our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations can be adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies as a result of the translation of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the us dollar exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business results of operations and financial condition while we hedge most foreign currency exposures of our business we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures and our hedging activities may not completely mitigate our foreign currency risks 

in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions and higher international sales this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 

our international operations and sales subject us to a number of special risks including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our investment portfolio may become impaired 

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio as of october 31 2009 consisted of investment grade municipal bonds taxexempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds recent economic conditions have increased the risk of credit downgrades in financial markets and we may suffer losses if our bond holdings are downgraded however we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer 

all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “availableforsale” under asc 320 investments—debt and equity securities  investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as “availableforsale” no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be otherthantemporary these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity net of tax 

during the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 we had no impairment charge associated with our shortterm investment portfolio however we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and our investment portfolio may suffer other than temporary impairments in future periods 

our banking partners may become insolvent or otherwise default on their obligations 

we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts provide credit under our revolving credit facility and provide banking transaction and deposit services worldwide should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations it could have a material impact on our financial results and reduce our credit availability 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 

under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights we are currently defending some of 

  

our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it 

these types of claims can however result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products invalidate a patent or family of patents require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors moreover some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited we aggressively pursue action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies we engaged in antipiracy efforts against certain companies located in china but these actions may not be successful we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to 

 

  

  

 if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions our business and operating results would be harmed in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulated organizations including the sec nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board many of these regulations continue to evolve making compliance more difficult and uncertain in addition our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

in particular section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to render an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports this effort has required and will continue to require in the future the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm could cause our stock price to decline 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal control system will prevent all error and all fraud regardless of how well designed and operated it is a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource 

  

constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us 

if we fail to timely recruit and retain key employees our business may be harmed 

to be successful we must attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees would harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation we face pressure from stockholders who must approve any increases in our equity pool to limit the use of such equity based compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders in addition we are required under us gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee sharebased equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit sharebased compensation these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive sharebased packages in the future which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 

despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 

we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications and technology systems for our development marketing operational support and sales activities a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake fire telecommunications failure cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in california near major earthquake faults we believe we have developed sufficient disaster recovery plans and backup systems 

  

to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results would be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part 1 of this annual report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business summary 

we are a world leader in the electronic design automation eda market we develop and license the complex software that engineers use to design integrated circuits also known as chips we offer a broad portfolio of highly integrated solutions that simplify the chip design process enable the development and production of electronic products and accelerate timetomarket for our customers 

our customers are generally large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs while our products are an important part of our customers’ development process our customers’ rd budget and spending decisions may be impacted by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs the recent global recession and continued uncertainty in the global economy have intensified our customers’ costs and investment challenges 

despite the recent global recession we have achieved consistent profitability and positive cash flow in the recent years including in fiscal 2009 we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution leading technology and strong customer relationships but also because of our recurring revenue business model under this model a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this recurring revenue over three years recurring revenue typically represents more than 90 of our total revenue the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period we typically enter each quarter with greater than 90 of our revenue for that particular quarter already committed from our customers providing for stability and predictability of results 

nevertheless our business model and longerterm financial results are not immune from a sustained economic downturn the financial turmoil and economic uncertainty over the last year have caused some of our customers to postpone investments and purchase decisions decrease their spending or delay payments to us if the financial turmoil and economic uncertainty continue and cause further customer bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers or if committed average annual revenue from customers does not grow our yearoveryear revenue results could be adversely affected 

we continue to monitor market conditions and may make adjustments to our business in order to reduce the adverse impact that the prolonged economic downturn could have on our business we expect to continue to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities in particular we may acquire companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic operational and financial performance of our business we believe that the combination of our solid financials leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “result of operations” below are based on our audited consolidated financial statements which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing these financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and net income on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

 

  

  

  

 revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue and to a lesser extent from hardware sales in accordance with asc 985605 software revenue recognition and asc 60525 multiple element arrangements  software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees hardware revenue consists of field programmable gate array fpga boardbased products 

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

 

  

   

 for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

 

  

  

 we recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these hardware sales is generally reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statement of operations if a technology subscription license is sold together with the hardware we recognize total revenue ratably over the term of the software license period or as customer installments become due and payable whichever is later 

we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statement of operations 

our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately 

we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and we recognize revenue from professional services as milestones are met and accepted we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 

we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 

  

2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

 

  

  

  

 valuation of stock compensation stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with asc 718 stock compensation  we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards the blackscholes optionpricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility expected term and the riskfree interest rates we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards we determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience in addition judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends these input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 

  

valuation of intangible assets we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customerinstalled baserelationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete customer backlog capitalized software development and other intangibles factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2009 

income taxes 

our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately 2740 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october 31 2009 will ultimately be realized however if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

included in our net deferred tax assets as of october 31 2009 are federal foreign tax credits of 710 million of which 679 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through 2018 the remaining 31 million in foreign tax credits are from acquired companies and will expire between fiscal 2010 and 2018 foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten years unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period and may only be used after foreign tax credits arising in each subsequent year have been used first our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period we have recorded a valuation allowance of 216 million with respect to our foreign tax credit carryforward the need for a valuation allowance with respect to foreign tax credits is subject to change based upon a number of factors including the amount of foreign tax credits arising in future years our forecasts of future foreign source income the amount of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the outcome of tax audit settlements and changes in income tax laws that may affect our ability to use such credits 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a 

  

discussion of taxes and the revenue agent’s reports from the irs we received in june 2005 and july 2008 asserting very large net increases to our us tax arising from the audit of fiscal 2000 through 2001 and fiscal 2002 through 2004 respectively 

results of operations 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest october 31 in fiscal year 2009 the saturday nearest october 31 was exactly october 31 2009 every seven years we have one extra week in our fiscal year that occurs in our first quarter fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 52week years fiscal 2007 was a 53week fiscal year the extra week in fiscal 2007 resulted in approximately 187 million of additional annual revenue related primarily to timebased licenses and approximately 172 million of additional annual expenses 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services and to a small extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses services and hardware products at varying times in most instances we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is shipped substantially all of our current timebased licenses are tsls with an average license term of approximately three years maintenance orders normally bring in revenue ratably over the maintenance period normally one year professional service orders generally turn into revenue upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones we generally recognize revenue from hardware product orders in full in the quarter that the product is shipped a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under critical accounting policies and estimates  

our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront license maintenance and professional service and hardware revenue for the period we derive timebased license revenue in any quarter largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional service revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted not when they are booked 

our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters conversely perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75 of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg a 120000 order for a perpetual license generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped but no future revenue additionally revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75 of the license fees is payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 

our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds of products and various license rights and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements for example they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost of design no single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 

  

as a result of customers seeking to conserve cash we shifted our business model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to our current model in which we target to achieve greater than 90 of our total revenue as recurring revenue the shift itself contributed to increases in comparative periods of revenue for the three years following and continues to slightly impact comparative periods of certain revenue line items as further described below 

while the electronics semiconductor and eda industries are currently experiencing uncertainty and weakness due to the recent downturn in the global economy to date our business model has substantially protected our financial results and enabled us to achieve revenue growth compared to the same periods in the previous year nevertheless our business model and longerterm financial results are not immune from sustained economic downturns the turmoil and uncertainty caused by current economic conditions have caused some of our customers to postpone their decisionmaking decrease their spending andor delay their payments to us yearoveryear revenue results could be adversely affected if committed average annual revenue from customers does not grow or if we experience additional customer bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers 

total revenue 

 

 the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to bookings in prior years including bookings with new products and features obtained through acquisitions leading to increased current period timebased license revenue 

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to bookings in prior years leading to increased current period timebased license revenue additionally total revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 increased by approximately 1 due to the strength of the japanese yen against the us dollar the increase was partially offset by fiscal 2008 having one less week of revenue of approximately 187 million compared to fiscal 2007 

timebased license revenue 

 

 the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the result of more revenue recognized in fiscal 2009 from licenses booked in prior periods in which revenue is recognized as customer installment payments become due and payable the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from tsls as a result of factors relating to the turmoil and uncertainty of the current economic conditions including several customer bankruptcies in fiscal 2009 

the increase in timebased license revenue for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher bookings in fiscal 2007 which contributed to the increase of timebased license revenue in fiscal 2008 tsl revenue continued to be the major contributor to total revenue since our business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 in addition but to a lesser extent the increase in timebased license revenue in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 resulted from more revenue recognized in fiscal 2008 from licenses booked in prior periods in which revenue is recognized as customer installment payments become due and payable the increase was partially offset by fiscal 2008 having one less week of revenues of approximately 172 million compared to fiscal 2007 

  

upfront license revenue 

 

 the decrease in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to normal fluctuations in customer license requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 

the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to product sales 

maintenance and service revenue 

 

 maintenance revenue increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the recognition of a full year of maintenance revenue for the products related to our acquisition in fiscal 2008 

maintenance revenue declined in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to 1 our completed shift towards tsls which include maintenance with the license fee and thus generate no separately recognized maintenance and service revenue and 2 the first quarter of fiscal 2008 having one less week of revenues resulting in a decrease in maintenance revenue of approximately 15 million compared to fiscal 2007 

professional services and other revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the decrease in customer demand in fiscal 2009 and the timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing consulting contracts 

professional services and other revenue increased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to timing of customer acceptance of performance milestones and services performed under ongoing contracts 

events affecting cost of revenues and operating expenses 

functional allocation of operating expenses we allocate certain human resource information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction restructuring or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool 

  

cost of revenue 

 

 we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and postcustomer contract support services we then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported 

cost of license revenue cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed allocated operating costs related to product support and distributions costs royalties paid to third party vendors and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility 

cost of maintenance and service revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization and costs associated with the delivery of our consulting services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets which is amortized to cost of revenue and operating expenses includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions 

cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased 1 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase of 57 million in employee related costs primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions and the increase in fair value of 24 million in our deferred compensation plan obligation the increase was partially offset by the decrease in travel related costs of 41 million 

cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was flat at 19 for both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase of 208 million in employee related costs primarily as a result of our acquisition in fiscal 2008 an increase of 27 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described and an increase of 29 million in direct costs as a result of hardware costs the increase was partially offset by the decline in fair value of 20 million in our deferred compensation plan obligation and one less week of costs of approximately 36 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

operating expenses 

research and development 

 

   

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase of 48 million in employee related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions an increase of 166 million in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation and an increase of 60 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described the increase was partially offset by the decrease of 41 million in travel related costs 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase of 320 million in employee related costs as a result of headcount increases including from our acquisition in fiscal 2008 and an increase of 76 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described the increase was partially offset by 184 million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation as a result of the overall decline of the financial market the absence of a 31 million earnoutretention bonus related to a prior year acquisition and one extra week of costs incurred in fiscal 2007 of approximately 66 million 

sales and marketing 

 

 the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to a decrease of 177 million in variable compensation and employee related costs and a decrease of 63 million in travel related costs the decrease in variable compensation was primarily driven by lower shipments the decrease was partially offset by the increase of 81 million in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation and 65 million of other sales and marketing expense 

the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a decrease of 146 million in employee related costs as a result of a decrease in headcount and the impact of 80 million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation and one less week of costs of approximately 54 million compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease was partially offset by an increase of 34 million in employee travel and communication related expenses 

general and administrative 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a 51 million in facility relocation expenses in fiscal 2009 including a 45 million restructuring charge related to a facility closure an increase of 47 million in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation and an increase of 23 million in bad debt reserve based on our review of customer receivables and an increase of 27 million in depreciation expense 

the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase of 72 million in employee related costs and an absence of 43 million gain for a land sale completed during fiscal 2007 and recorded as an offset to expense under this line item the increase was partially offset by 50 million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation and one less week of expenses of approximately 15 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007

the income or loss due to the change in fair value of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in each functional operating expense the offsetting income or loss due to the change in fair value of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan asset is recorded in other income loss net as the assets are classified as trading securities the overall net impact to our consolidated statements of operations from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and assets is immaterial for all periods presented 

the increase or decrease in fair value of the deferred compensation plan obligation is reported in total cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the year over year effect of the fair value change was an increase of 317 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 correspondingly the increase in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan asset was approximately 331 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 this change was a result of the better performing financial markets in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

the yearoveryear effect of the fair value change was a decrease of approximately 334 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 correspondingly the decrease in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan asset was approximately 328 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and reported in other income net this change was a result of the substantial decline of financial markets in fiscal 2008 see note 8 and 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements —employee benefit plans and other income loss net 

effect of foreign currency on expenses 

foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging did not have a significant impact during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 

inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd expense is composed of inprocess technologies of 22 million associated with the acquisitions in fiscal 2009 48 million for an acquisition in fiscal 2008 and 32 million for acquisitions in fiscal 2007 as of the date of the respective acquisitions the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses and therefore the amounts were charged to expense projects from prior year acquisitions have been completed and the fiscal 2009 project is anticipated to be completed over a period of two years from the date of the acquisition 

valuation of iprd upon acquisition of other companies we expense any iprd as it represents incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology the successful development of the iprd its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at the time of determination 

  

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows 

 

 amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table as it is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to addition of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions in fiscal 2009 offset by certain intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized 

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to completion of the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in prior years’ acquisitions partially offset by the intangible assets acquired as a result of our acquisition in fiscal 2008 

see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts which information is included herein 

impairment of intangible assets we did not record any impairment charges to the intangible assets during fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

other income loss net 

 

 the increase in other income loss net in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in income on our deferred compensation plan see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for our employee benefit plans the increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates 

the decrease in other income loss net in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a litigation settlement of 125 million received from magma in fiscal 2007 

  

income taxes 

the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as of october 31 2009 current deferred tax assets net of current deferred tax liabilities totaled 735 million noncurrent deferred tax assets net of noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled 2005 million we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would record a charge to income and an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination 

as of october 31 2009 we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states if the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future we would provide taxes on such excess amount as of october 31 2009 there was approximately 3587 million of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 

see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes  

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 

the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2009 

cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 

 

 during fiscal 2009 our primary sources and uses of cash consisted of 1 cash generated from operating activities of 2392 million 2 proceeds from issuances of common stock of 719 million 3 payments for purchases of investments net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of 965 million 4 net payments related to acquisitions of 534 million and 5 purchases of property and equipment of 392 million 

cash flows 

 

   

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements to be classified as upfront revenue we require that 75 of a term or perpetual license fee be paid within the first year conversely payment terms for tsls are generally extended and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually in even increments over the term of the license accordingly we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from timebased licenses revenue 

fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 cash from operating activities decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in deferred revenue due to the timing of billings and cash payments from certain customers increased payments to vendors compared to fiscal 2008 and a tax prepayment for an irs settlement see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 cash from operating activities decreased primarily due to the timing of billings and cash payments from customers compared to fiscal 2007 delivering lower cash inflows during fiscal 2008 and also as a result of a litigation settlement of 125 million received from magma during fiscal 2007 

cash used in investing activities 

fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 the decrease in cash used primarily relates to a decrease in our purchases of marketable securities and cash paid for acquisitions as compared to fiscal 2008 offset by the timing of maturities of marketable securities 

fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 the decrease in cash used primarily relates to the sale of marketable securities for our acquisition of synplicity and as a result of lower capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 the increase in cash provided primarily relates to the absence of common stock repurchases in fiscal 2009 offset by a decrease in the number of options exercised by employees compared to fiscal 2008 

fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 the increase in cash used primarily relates to more common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and options exercised by employees compared to fiscal 2007 see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our stock repurchase program 

we hold our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and in foreign accounts primarily in ireland bermuda and japan as of october 31 2009 we held an aggregate of 6124 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and an aggregate of 5559 million in foreign accounts funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings as described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements  

we expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions 

accounts receivable net 

 

   

our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities our dso was 34 days at october 31 2009 and 38 days at october 31 2008 the decrease in dso along with a decrease in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to our collection efforts and several customer bankruptcies 

net working capital working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2009 our net working capital was 6492 million compared to 4133 million as of october 31 2008 the increase of 2359 million was primarily due to an increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 2170 million and an increase in other current assets of 50 million along with decreases 1 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 347 million 2 90 million in accrued income taxes and 3 507 million in deferred revenue these increases were partially offset by decreases in current deferred tax asset of 602 million and in accounts receivable of 204 million as described above 

other commitments —credit facility on october 20 2006 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to synopsys and certain of our foreign subsidiaries the amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional 1500 million through the fourth year of the facility the facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants the facility terminates on october 20 2011 borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 however we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 050 and 070 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant in addition commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0125 and 0175 per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant as of october 31 2009 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants 

as a result of an acquisition in fiscal 2009 we assumed two credit facilities as of october 31 2009 these facilities have been cancelled and the borrowings outstanding have been completely paid down 

other 

our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio as of october 31 2009 consists of investment grade municipal bonds taxexempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as a result of current adverse financial market conditions some financial instruments such as structured investment vehicles subprime mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns as of october 31 2009 we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and no exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we had no impairment charge associated with our shortterm investment portfolio while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity we have taken steps including regularly reviewing our investments and associated risk profiles which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio 

as a result of the challenging conditions in the financial markets we have been more proactively managing our cash and cash equivalents and investments and closely monitoring our capital and stock repurchase expenditures additionally we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio invested in securities with a weightedaverage credit rating exceeding aa the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments as measured under fair value guidance see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2009 

 

  

    in connection with acquisitions completed prior to october 31 2009 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 37 million in cash during the fiscal 2010 and an additional 47 million during fiscal years 2011 and 2012 if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals these amounts are not reflected in the table above 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

as of october 31 2009 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a 4 ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of these investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

  

the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31 2009 

 

 as of october 31 2009 the stated maturities of our current shortterm investments are 880 million within one year 1821 million within one to five years 648 million within five to ten years and 1318 million after ten years however we consider these investments to be shortterm in nature because in accordance with our investment policy the weighted average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for shortterm obligations and other uses including acquisitions these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2009 that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

 

 the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2008 that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates 

 

 foreign currency risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for our principal irish hungarian and swiss subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the us dollar we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on nonfunctional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future 

  

intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 19 months a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31 2009 the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 99 million and we would be required to pay approximately 99 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 99 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized gain of approximately 96 million and loss of approximately 160 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2009 and october 31 2008 respectively 

if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties further we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements 

the following table provides information about the absolute values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2009 

 

   

the following table provides information about the absolute values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2008 

 

 equity risk our strategic investment portfolio as of october 31 2009 consists of approximately 98 million of minority equity investments in publicly traded and privately held companies compared to approximately 143 million as of october 31 2008 the securities of publicly traded companies are classified as availableforsale securities under asc 320 investments—debt and equity securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by 72 million and 11 million respectively we did not reduce the value of our strategic investment portfolio during fiscal 2007 none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes

stockholder recommendations for nominations of directors 

the governance committee considers candidates for board membership suggested by board members and management of synopsys the governance committee has on occasion retained thirdparty executive search firms to identify independent director candidates the governance committee will consider persons recommended by our stockholders in the same manner as a nominee recommended by board members management or a thirdparty executive search firm a stockholder who wishes to suggest a prospective nominee for the board should notify our secretary or any member of the governance committee in writing with any supporting material the stockholder considers appropriate after completing the evaluation and review the governance committee makes a recommendation to the full board as to the person who should be nominated to the board and the board determines and approves the nominees after considering the recommendation and report of the governance committee 

if a stockholder wishes to recommend a candidate for nomination to our board he or she should forward the name of that nominee and related information as required by our bylaws such as occupation and the number of shares which are beneficially owned by the nominee to the governance committee in care of the corporate secretary at least six months before the next annual meeting to assure time for meaningful consideration by the governance committee prior to or at the time the governance committee approves the agenda for each stockholder meeting the governance committee evaluates all nominees for director including any nominee that may have been properly proposed by stockholders the governance committee has not to date adopted a formal process for consideration of stockholder nominees because it believes this informal consideration process has been adequate given the lack of stockholder nominations in the past however the governance committee intends to review periodically whether a more formal policy should be adopted 

there have been no recent material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees for the board 

section 16a beneficial ownership reporting compliance

based solely on its review of the copies of the forms 3 4 and 5 filed by or received from its reporting persons or written representations received from such persons we believe that each of our directors executive officers and greater than ten percent beneficial owners of our common stock during fiscal 2007 complied with all filing requirements applicable to such persons

 item 11—executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

in this section we explain and analyze the material elements of our compensation program for our named executive officers who are identified in the summary compensation table on page 17 of this form 10ka the purpose of this discussion is to provide the context necessary to understand specific compensation for our named executive officers as detailed in the tables and narratives following this section 

our compensation philosophy and objectives 

our executive compensation program is designed to attract motivate reward and retain talented individuals who are essential to our continued success and to increasing stockholder value the following objectives and principles apply to all determinations of the form and amount of compensation for our named executive officers 

• provide compensation that is sufficiently competitive in our industry and geography to attract and retain highquality executive officers • create financial incentives for executives to achieve our important business plans and strategic objectives • motivate executives to deliver results above our plan targets • align the interests of executives and our stockholders through the use of longterm incentives while effectively managing stockholder dilution • reinforce a culture of accountability and excellence and • promote teamwork among our executive team by considering internal equity in setting compensation levels 8 

compensation setting process 

our compensation committee the committee determines all aspects of compensation for our named executive officers 

compensation decision timeline in the first quarter of each fiscal year the compensation committee determines compensation targets base salaries incentive plan design and incentive plan performance goals for that fiscal year the committee also makes final determinations of whether our named executive officers have earned incentive cash bonuses for the preceding fiscal year based on the committees review of our financial results for the year 

decision framework because the committee considers the competitiveness of its executive compensation program a key objective of the program it evaluates market information about the compensation of executive officers at similarsized companies facing similarly complex business challenges the market data is used as a guide against which the committee evaluates the compensation of each of the named executive officers in light of the executives scope of responsibility domain expertise business knowledge and significance to our corporate objectives this process allows the committee to set compensation at levels appropriate to retain and motivate our executive leadership 

the committee generally uses the median or 50 th percentile of compensation for similar positions at similarly complex businesses as a market reference or guide to determine total direct compensation base salary cashbased incentives and equity compensation for our named executive officers the compensation committee may approve compensation of individuals above or below this market guide based upon performance position experience and our budget the committee also believes that our executive compensation program should contain elements that align the interests of our executives with the interests of synopsys and our stockholders in synopsys achieving betterthanexpected financial results such as the abovemarket bonus payments paid under our annual cash incentive plan for abovetarget performance the committee also believes that bonuses should not be paid for performance that is less than 90 of target and should be capped if performance is better than 125 of target finally the committee believes that equity awards are a useful element in the compensation program because they can align executive incentives with stockholder interests 

the compensation committee uses two sources of executive compensation market data radford executive compensation survey data and information available through equilar a compensation benchmark firm our human resources group summarizes the information from these surveys for the committee the radford executive compensation survey data alone is used to establish salary and incentive cash levels the radford executive compensation survey data and the equilar data are both used to establish equity compensation amounts 

the compensation committee selects our peer group of companies for executive compensation purposes on an annual basis with input from a third party consultant and our chief executive officer except with respect to his own compensation in 2007 the committee used the following criteria to select the peer group of companies semiconductor or software companies with revenue of between 650 million and 25 billion which is generally indicative of organizational complexity and operations in northern california in addition the committee considers the size of organizations as measured by 

employee count and market capitalization the companies that comprised the peer group for fiscal 2007 were 

 decision support since september 2006 we have engaged radford surveys  consulting radford to serve as the committees compensation consultant reporting directly to the committee for fiscal 2007 the committee instructed radford to review the market data collected by our human resources group to ensure that the data upon which the committee relies is accurate in addition radford helps the committee interpret the comparative data and provides objective insight into the reasonableness of our executive officer compensation levels including that of our chief executive officer radford also provides the committee objective thirdparty advice on emerging trends in the market that may not yet be reflected in the comparative data radford provides written reports for the compensation committee and attends committee meetings to respond to questions from committee members 

the committee also relies upon performance assessments and suggested compensation targets for the named executive officers that are provided by our chief executive officer president and chief operating officer and senior vice president of human resources to assess the chief executive officers performance the committee oversees a comprehensive assessment process that is conducted by the senior vice president of human resources and then summarized by the chairman of the compensation committee during discussions about our chief executives officers compensation he is excused from the meetings and does not influence the decision process or outcome 

section 162m of the internal revenue code generally places a limit of 1000000 on the amount of compensation we may deduct for federal income tax purposes in any one year with respect to certain highly compensated officers in order to maintain flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a matter designed to promote achievement of corporate goals the compensation committee will not necessarily limit executive compensation to that which is deductible under section 162m of the internal revenue code 

elements of executive compensation 

our executive compensation program includes the following elements 

• base salary • annual cashbased incentive awards • equitybased awards and • employee stock purchase plan and other benefits base salary 

base salary is baseline cash compensation paid to executive officers throughout the year regardless of stockholder returns or our performance the committee believes that base salary should provide executive officers with a predictable income sufficient to attract and retain strong talent in a competitive marketplace to accomplish this objective the compensation committee considers peer 

group compensation data the executive officers position responsibility level experience and objectives for the ensuing year the executive officers past performance relative to corporate business group and individual objectives and the executive officers base compensation relative to other synopsys executive officers and employees the committee also considers the potential annual cashbased incentives with the objective of achieving total annual cash compensation for named executives that is approximately equal to the 50 th percentile annual cash compensation for our peer group of companies when our performance is ontarget 

the compensation committee set salary for dr de geus our chief executive officer at approximately the 25 th percentile relative to peer group data but provides incentive cash compensation above the 50 th percentile in order to promote our payforperformance philosophy combined the salary and cash incentive provide total cash compensation for dr de geus that is around the 50 th percentile of our peer group of companies consistent with the committees overall objective with respect to dr fichtner the committee made no change to his salary upon being appointed an executive officer in 2007 base salaries are typically reviewed annually and were not increased in 2007 

annual cashbased incentive awards 

the compensation committee uses cashbased incentive awards to align the interests of executive officers with the interests of our stockholders annual cash bonuses are intended to motivate executive officers to achieve annual financial targets set by the committee for fiscal 2007 the committee selected companylevel financial targets for our named executive officers in order to focus executive attention on attaining our financial objectives and to foster teamwork among the members of our management team for executives leading product or field business groups the committee also selected grouplevel measures of performance in order to ensure that each business group is properly contributing to our overall objectives 

target incentive compensation incentive compensation payable if performance metrics are achieved at 100 of target is expressed as a percentage of the named executive officers annual base salary for fiscal 2007 target incentive compensation for each of the named executive officers was as follows 

 as discussed above under base salary the committee has set an abovemarket level of target incentive compensation for dr de geus because his base salary was at the 25 th percentile relative to peer group data the committee believes that making a large percentage of dr de geus total cash compensation at risk promotes our payforperformance philosophy and maximizes his incentive to lead our company to achieve its overall business objectives and drive value for our stockholders dr de geus total cash compensation assuming the companys business objectives are achieved remains consistent with the 50 th percentile of our peer group of companies 

dr fichtner who was appointed an executive officer in december 2006 was compensated in fiscal 2007 exclusively under arrangements entered into with him when we acquired ise integrated systems engineering ag ise in 2005 at that time we agreed to pay dr fichtner specified amounts over a period of three years based upon achievement of ise sales and retention milestones for fiscal 2007 

dr fichtner earned the incentive bonus as a result of the milestone achievements and the compensation committee also agreed to provide a discretionary bonus to dr fichtner of approximately 72000 in recognition of the consistent achievement of ise sales milestones over all three years 

performance criteria for the cash incentive compensation are set forth in our 2007 executive incentive plan executive plan which was approved by the committee during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 for fiscal 2007 the committee selected the following measures 



 gaap operating margin adjusted to eliminate the effect of amortization of intangible assets inprocess research and development charges integration and other acquisitionrelated expenses facilities and workforce realignment charges and other significant items which in the opinion of management are infrequent or nonrecurring  represents the portion of total backlog that we expect to recognize as revenue in fiscal 2008  confidential the compensation committee considered these performance criteria the best indicators of financial performance for synopsys reflecting both current period performance and future prospects given our business model the committee sought to encourage attention to current year performance and activities to promote future revenue predictability specifically the committee selected 2007 revenue and 2007 nongaap operating margin as performance measures because they indicate current year performance the committee selected 2007 accepted orders and 2008 revenue backlog as performance measures because they indicate future revenue the 2007 growth initiatives component represented our strategic programs for synopsys that lay the foundation for improved financial and operational success the committee selected a relatively equal weighting between these criteria to encourage management to focus on nearterm financial goals while also pursuing longterm benefits for synopsys and our stockholders 

the compensation committee set specific targets for each of the executive plan performance criteria set forth above based on the boardapproved business operating plan disclosure of our confidential executive plan performance targets would present a risk of competitive harm to synopsys however the committee set targets that it believed should be achievable in the absence of changes in overall economic conditions while also delivering significant performance improvement over the prior year 

under our executive plan bonuses paid to our named executive officers are dependent on the level of achievement of each performance target if the level of weighted achievement for all performance targets in the aggregate is below 90 of target no bonus is paid the committee set a threshold of 90 which is more stringent than thresholds of many similarsized companies because of its commitment to provide financial rewards to executive officers only when important business objectives are achieved the threshold for nonexecutive officers eligible for bonuses based upon company performance is lower than for executive officers as performance exceeds the threshold the percent of bonus earned increases and once performance exceeds 100 the percentage of bonus earned is accelerated for example at 90 weighted achievement 50 of bonus is earned at 100 of target 100 of bonus is earned and at 125 weighted achievement 180 of target bonus is earned 

the compensation committee believes this bonus structure encourages our executives to maximize their efforts to achieve outstanding results the committee also believes that the likelihood of 125 weighted achievement is remote 

in december 2007 following the end of 2007 the compensation committee determined that we achieved 1074 weighted performance under the 2007 executive plan and that the business units achieved on average 1031 weighted performance for fiscal 2007 the compensation committee retained the right to reduce individual bonus payments or to increase them based upon individual or business group performance factors but decided not to modify executive plan bonuses for our named executive officers materially fiscal 2007 executive plan bonuses paid to our named executive officers were as follows 



 dr fichtner did not participate in the executive plan but was paid pursuant to the ise acquisition agreement in december 2005 the compensation committee approved a special onetime operating plan incentive opi arrangement which provided for cash bonuses and stock option grants vesting upon our achievement of specified nongaap operating margin targets for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 the compensation committee adopted the opi because it believed our operating margins were low relative to our business competitors operating margins and the committee sought to provide the executive team with additional incentives to improve this financial measure since 2005 our nongaap operating margin more than doubled as a result of our achieving nongaap operating margin in excess of 20 the fiscal 2007 opi cash bonus was paid and the second half of the opi stock option grants vested amounts paid to named executive officers under the opi in fiscal 2007 and the number of opi stock options vested in fiscal 2007 were as follows 



 dr fichtner was not eligible to participate in the opi because he became an executive officer in december 2006 equitybased awards 

the compensation committee uses equity awards primarily to motivate our named executive officers to focus on longerterm strategies to increase stockholder value and secondarily to retain executive officers generally our equity awards vest over four years which the committee believes encourages retention of key leadership and focuses them on business growth and stock price appreciation 

in fiscal 2007 as an element of longterm incentive compensation the committee granted stock options to executive officers the committee believes that stock options generally are an important form of longterm incentive compensation to grant to our executives because stock options align their interests with the interests of stockholders by having value only if our stock price increases over time the committee granted an average of 30 fewer stock options in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 because for the first time in fiscal 2007 the committee also granted performancebased restricted stock units to our named executive officers in order to promote our payforperformance philosophy these restricted stock unit awards are at risk if performance goals are not achieved the committee believes that in addition to promoting the payforperformance philosophy once earned restricted stock units encourage executive retention during economic or market cycles when our stock price declines because the restricted stock unit retains a large portion of its value even if the stock price declines after the date of grant the committee also believes that restricted stock unit awards are increasingly common among our peer group of companies so this element of compensation is part of a competitive compensation package in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the committee awarded restricted stock units to the named executive officers that would vest only if we attained 1890 million nongaap net income for fiscal 2007 because that target was achieved on the date that we reported our financial results for fiscal 2007 25 of the restricted stock units vested and the remainder will vest in three equal annual installments so long as the executive remains an employee if we had not achieved our nongaap net income target the entire restricted stock unit award would have expired immediately 

the number of stock options and restricted stock units granted to named executive officers is based on a target equity value as noted above under decision framework we generally use the target equity value of stock options and restricted stock units combined to set total equitybased compensation at the desired 50 th percentile level for each named executive officer while the committee reviews the realized or unrealized value of prior equity awards when determining the target economic value of equity awards the committee believes that each current equity award is an incentive to drive future stockholder return 

in 2007 the exercise price of stock options was set at the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market on the date of the prescheduled compensation committee meeting at which the options were awarded 

in fiscal 2006 the compensation committee granted stock options under the opi described above subject to performance vesting over two years each named executive officer other than dr fichtner who was not eligible to participate because he was not a named executive officer in fiscal 2006 received stock options that vested and were earned in two equal installments as we achieved the predetermined operating margin targets for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 mr beattie was added to the opi program when he joined synopsys in january 2006 

employee stock purchase plan and other benefits 

employee stock purchase plan our named executive officers may participate in our employee stock purchase plan a broadbased plan that enables eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discounted price the plan qualifies under section 423 of the internal revenue code and is therefore required to be made available to all us employees including executive officers serving the requisite numbers of hours the plan permits employees to acquire shares of our common stock through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10 of total cash compensation up to a maximum of 7500 per sixmonth purchase period the price per share at which participating employees may purchase our common stock is 85 of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at the beginning of a rolling twoyear offering period or the end of each sixmonth purchase period subject to a plan limit on the number of shares that may be purchased in a purchase period 

taxqualified 401k retirement plan our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our taxqualified 401k retirement plan on the same terms as other employees we contribute 040 for every dollar an employee contributes to the plan up to a maximum contribution of 1500 per year 

deferred compensation plan although executive officers are eligible to participate in our taxqualified 401k retirement plan the internal revenue code limits the dollar amounts of deferrals and contributions by us that can be made to plan accounts to compensate for these limitations which apply in practice to more highlycompensated employees the committee established a deferred compensation plan under which executive officers may elect to defer up to 50 of their base salary compensation and up to 100 of their annual bonus distributions from the deferred compensation plan are generally payable upon termination of employment over five to 15 years or as a lump sum payment at the option of the employee since its inception we have not made any matching or discretionary contributions to the deferred compensation plan there are no provisions that provide for any guarantee or minimum return on investments undistributed amounts under the deferred compensation plan are subject to the claims of our creditors the committee offers this benefit to our named executive officers and other eligible employees because it provides a tax benefit for the participating employees at a relatively low cost to us 

health and welfare benefits we provide certain other employee benefits—consisting of programs for employees generally including health benefits life insurance and other welfare benefits for dr fichtner who resides in switzerland we were obligated by swiss law to contribute to a retirement fund to an extent equal to the employees contribution 

severance and change of control benefits 

executive change of control severance benefit plan in fiscal 2006 the board approved an executive change of control severance benefit plan the change of control plan in order to compensate our executive officers in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following a change of control of synopsys the purpose of the change of control plan is to protect the interests of our executives while encouraging them to continue to fulfill our objectives during and following a change of control we believe that the protections afforded under the plan help us recruit and retain executives and that they are consistent with those offered by the companies in our peer group the change of control plan has a double trigger providing benefits only if the executives employment with us is terminated following the change of control these benefits are payable only in the event an executives employment is terminated without cause within 30 days before or 12 months after a change of control or is constructively terminated within 12 months after a change of control the benefits consist of in addition to any unpaid salary bonus or benefits to which the executive otherwise is entitled 1 a cash severance payment equal to one year of base salary 2 one to two times the executives target annual bonus depending upon the timing of the termination within our fiscal year 3 a cash payment equal to the estimated cost of health care premiums for one year and 4 full acceleration of all unvested stock options and other stock awards held by the executive at the time of termination an executive may be required to enter into an 18month noncompetition agreement and must sign a release in order to receive benefits should a qualifying termination occur the change of control plan does not provide any benefits if the termination is voluntary or for cause 

cause for termination would include certain acts of dishonesty negligence or willful misconduct or continuing failure to perform ones job duties and fulfill ones obligations to us a constructive termination is an executives resignation within 60 days following a reduction in duties salary target bonus or benefits or a relocation of more than 75 miles in each case without the executives consent 

a change of control is defined generally under the change of control plan as the acquisition by a third party of more than 50 of the voting power of our outstanding voting securities a merger or consolidation after which our stockholders do not own at least 50 of the voting power of the new 

entity or its parent in each case in the same proportion as their ownership of our voting securities immediately prior to the transaction the approval by our stockholders or board of directors of a plan of complete dissolution or liquidation or a complete dissolution or liquidation otherwise occurs a disposition of all or substantially all of our assets other than to an entity of which more than 50 of the voting securities are owned by stockholders of the company or members of our board of directors including new directors approved or recommended by a majority of the board cease to constitute at least a majority of the board 

other change of control arrangements our change of control arrangements with dr de geus and dr chan are included in employment agreements entered into before adoption of the change of control plan and therefore they do not participate in the change of control plan these agreements were negotiated with dr de geus and dr chan in 1997 to provide them additional financial security and thereby retain their services for synopsys each change of control agreement provides that in the event of an involuntary termination other than for cause within 24 months following a change of control of synopsys the executive will receive 1 a cash payment equal to two times his base compensation for the current fiscal year or the immediately preceding fiscal year whichever is greater 2 a cash payment equal to two times his target incentive for the current fiscal year or if there is no target incentive in effect for the current fiscal year the highest target incentive in the last three fiscal years 3 the estimated cash value of his health care premiums for 18 months and 4 full acceleration of all unvested stock options the executive must sign a release of claims in order to receive any severance payments 

dr de geus and dr chans agreements also provide for severance benefits in the event of an involuntary termination other than for cause outside the 24month period following a change of control in this event the executive would receive 1 a cash payment equal to his base compensation during the fiscal year or immediately preceding fiscal year whichever is greater 2 a cash payment equal to the target incentive then in effect or if there is no target incentive in effect for such year the highest target incentive in the three preceding years provided the executive does not engage in misconduct generally conduct harmful to our interests including disclosure of confidential information disparagement or direct competition for six months following the termination date and 3 the estimated cash value of his health care premiums for 12 months 

under these agreements cause for termination has a similar meaning as it does under the change of control plan and an involuntary termination includes in addition to any termination not for cause a reduction in duties authority responsibilities perquisites office space base compensation or employee benefits a relocation of more than 50 miles or the failure of synopsys to obtain the assumption of the agreement by a successor 

a change of control is defined generally under the agreements as the acquisition by a third party of 50 of the voting power of our outstanding voting securities a merger or consolidation after which our stockholders do not own at least 50 of the voting power of the new entity or its parent the approval by our stockholders of a plan of complete dissolution or liquidation an agreement for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or during a twoyear period members of our board of directors including new directors approved or recommended by a majority the board cease to constitute at least a majority of the board 

dr fichtner entered into an employment agreement with us in connection with our acquisition of his former employer ise integrated systems engineering ag in the event we were to terminate the agreement other than for cause dr fichtner would have been able to continue his participation in the ise sales and retention milestone plan as if he continued to be an employee of synopsys 

in addition our employee stock and option plans provide for the acceleration of the vesting of any unvested options or stock awards in the event they are not assumed continued or substituted by the surviving or acquiring company following certain corporate transactions including a sale or other 

disposition of 90 of our outstanding securities a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets a merger or consolidation after which we are not the surviving corporation or a merger or consolidation after which we are the surviving corporation but our outstanding shares are converted into other property 

share ownership guidelines 

in order to align the interests of our senior executives with the interests of our stockholders in fiscal 2003 the board adopted stock ownership guidelines these guidelines recommend that covered officers achieve share ownership levels within four years of appointment and hold those shares so long as they serve in such positions as follows chief executive officer—50000 shares president and chief operating officer—25000 shares and chief financial officer and all senior vice presidents—10000 shares 

covered officers may acquire shares through stock option exercises vesting of restricted stock units purchases under our employee stock purchase plan open market purchases made in compliance with applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy or acquisitions under any other equity plans we may adopt from time to time each covered officer is expected to meet the applicable guidelines within four years of becoming a covered officer the guidelines do not require any covered officer to exercise stock options or to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market solely to meet these guidelines however when stock options are exercised or shares are purchased under our employee stock purchase plan the guidelines recommend that the covered officer retain a number of shares of common stock equal to the lesser of 25 of the net value of shares of common stock acquired or vested after deducting the exercise price if any and taxes at an assumed tax rate or a number of shares necessary to reach such officers applicable common stock ownership guideline amount at fiscal year end and to date each named executive officer either holds the requisite number of shares or has not yet served for four years accordingly all named executive officers are in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines

we pay our nonemployee directors compensation for serving on our board we do not pay our employees who serve on our board any additional compensation for serving on our board we currently have seven nonemployee directors serving on our board our compensation committee reviews from time to time the compensation we pay to our nonemployee directors and recommends as appropriate adjustments to such compensation there have been no adjustments since fiscal 2005 the compensation we pay to our nonemployee directors consists of two components which are equity awards and cash compensation we also reimburse directors for outofpocket expenses for travel to board meetings 

equity nonemployee directors are eligible to receive equity awards under the 2005 nonemployee directors equity incentive plan which provides for automatic grants of equity awards to each nonemployee member of our board upon their initial appointment or election and upon their reelection each year 

initial awards—new nonemployee directors receive an initial option for 30000 shares vesting in annual equal installments on the date preceding each of the first four annual stockholders meetings following the grant date assuming continued board service through each vesting date as well as an interim award in the form of stock options representing an annual award prorated for the period of time remaining until the next annual meeting 

annual awards—each person who is reelected to serve as a nonemployee director receives an annual award comprised of either 1 an option grant with the number of shares subject to the option determined so that the aggregate fair value of the option calculated using the option pricing model used to determine the value of stockbased compensation in our financial statements will equal the annual cash retainer then paid to nonemployee directors or 2 a restricted stock grant with the number of shares subject to the award determined so that the fair market value of the restricted stock grant on the date of grant will equal the annual cash retainer then paid to nonemployee directors the option grant or restricted stock vest in a series of 36 successive equal monthly installments from the grant date assuming continued board membership through each vesting date the board elected to receive restricted stock for 2006 and future years and as a result we issued an aggregate of 4690 shares of restricted stock to each nonemployee director in 2007 

the 2005 nonemployee directors equity incentive plan expires on the day immediately preceding our 2010 annual stockholders meeting 

cash we pay nonemployee directors an annual retainer of 125000 for serving as a director we also pay a per meeting fee to members of our audit committee of 2000 per committee meeting 4000 for the audit committee chair up to an annual maximum of 8000 16000 for the audit committee chair the retainers and meeting fees are paid quarterly

the role of eda in the electronics industry 

technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density speed power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors also referred to as integrated circuits ics or chips 

·   since the early 1960s steadily decreasing feature widths the widths of the wires imprinted on the chip that form the transistors and other developments have enabled ic manufacturers to follow “moore’s law” approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip

·   chips have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones digital cameras music players and personal digital assistants

·   increasingly single systemsonachip socs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ics attached to a printed circuit board

combined these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower cost higher performance computers wireless communications networks hand held devices internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices each advance however has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and eda software suppliers such as synopsys 

these technological challenges have been accompanied by unprecedented business challenges stemming from the semiconductor downturn in 20002002 increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products 

the ic design process 

eda software enables designers to create complex semiconductors in simplified form the ic design process consists of the steps described below 

system design   in system design the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized highlevel computer language typically c  or system c this phase yields a relatively high level behavioral model of the chip

register transfer level rtl design   rtl design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level computer language typically verilog or vhdl

logic design   logic design or “synthesis” programs convert the rtl code into a logical diagram of the chip and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors or gates to be built on the chip

functional verification   at the rtl level of ic design the designer uses functional verification tools such as rtl simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended the increasing size and complexity of today’s ics and socs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs with verification estimated to consume 60 to 70 of total design time as a result designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds and that can reduce verification risk ie find design bugs before designs are taken into production

physical design   in the physical design stage the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with “place and route” products the designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip as well as the location for each transistor within each block a process known as “placement” in many designs placement is performed in 

conjunction with logic synthesis a process known as “physical synthesis” after placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors a process known as “routing” with increasing gate counts and design complexity seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important 

physical verification   before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication the designer must perform a series of further verification steps checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip

design for manufacturing   the design is then translated to a series of photomasks or physical representations of the design ic manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ics as ic wire or “feature” sizes shrink this translation is becoming more and more difficult these challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced technology computeraided design or tcad tools are also used to model individual features or “devices” within the design to help ensure manufacturability finally various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ics contained on each silicon wafer

intellectual property reuse   as ic designs continue to grow in size and complexity designers have found that inserting predesigned and preverified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified usually such ip blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ics including microprocessors digital signal processors or connectivity ip that support such protocols as usb pci express or ethernet

strategy 

with increasing chip complexity designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially and must repeat some steps such as verification multiple times before finishing the design each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet timetomarket goals synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next 

in addition smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before synopsys has invested heavily in design for manufacturing tools and technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield 

also many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed we offer systemlevel products that permit designers to develop such software earlier in the ic design process speeding overall development time 

finally designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition we address this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality preverified standardsbased and other ip which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence

support for industry standards 

we actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity improve interoperability of tools from different vendors ensure connectivity and interoperability of intellectual property ip building blocks and solve design problems standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations from industry consortia by company licensing made available to all from de facto usage or through open source licensing 

synopsys’ products support many standards including the most commonly used hardware description languages vhdl verilog hdl systemverilog and systemc our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats and interfaces for the exchange of data among our tools other eda vendor’s products and applications that customers develop internally we also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our ip product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity 

synopsys is a member of more than 30 industry standards organizations including design and reuse fabless semiconductor association european electronic chips and systems design initiative gigabit ethernet consortia mobile industry processor interface openaccess coalition open systemc initiative and virtual socket interface alliance in addition we are a board member andor strongly active participant in influential eda standards and interoperability organizations including accellera the institute of electrical and electronics engineers powerorg structure for packaging integrating and reusing ip within toolflows and the silicon integration initiative 

synopsys’ tapin sm program provides interface standards to all companies through an open source licensing model synopsys other eda companies and eda customers use these standards to facilitate interoperability of their tools the standards offered through our tapin program include our liberty Ô format for library modeling sdc for design constraints saif for switching activity the openvera ® language for hardware verification and open mast for electromechanical design modeling synopsys’ common database milkyway is available for tool integration by eda vendors through our mapin sm program synopsys manages changes and enhancements that come from the community of licensees for all tapin and mapin standards with liberty’s change management being operated within the silicon integration initiative finally synopsys provides access to our tools for other eda vendors to help identify facilitate and develop optimal flows and solutions for our mutual customers through our insync program

sales distribution and backlog 

we market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets we typically distribute our products and documentation to customers electronically but provide physical media ie cdroms when requested by the customer 

we maintain salessupport centers throughout the united states outside the united states we maintain salessupport offices in canada denmark finland france germany hong kong hungary india israel italy japan the netherlands the people’s republic of china singapore south korea sweden taiwan and the united kingdom our foreign headquarters is located in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2 properties  

in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 an aggregate of 49 49 and 45 respectively of synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is incorporated by reference here information relating to risks associated with foreign operations is described in part i item 1a risk factors stagnation of foreign economies foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance and is incorporated by reference here 

historically our orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next fiscal year although the timing of major license renewals can alter this trend under our previous license model revenue seasonality resulted principally from the decline in the amount of upfront orders from the fourth quarter of one fiscal year to the first quarter of the next fiscal year however as a result of the shift in our license model as more fully described in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we experienced significantly less revenue seasonality during fiscal 2005 and 2006 and we expect revenue seasonality to be minimal in the foreseeable future although orders seasonality may continue 

synopsys’ aggregate backlog was approximately 201 billion on october 31 2006 representing a 4 increase from backlog of 192 billion on october 31 2005 aggregate backlog includes deferred revenue operational backlog and financial backlog deferred revenue represents that portion of orders for software products license maintenance and other services which have been delivered and billed to the customer but on which the revenue has not yet been recognized operational backlog consists of orders for software products and maintenance that have not been shipped and orders for consulting services that have not yet been performed and accepted financial backlog consists of future installments not yet due and payable under existing timebased licenses and maintenance contracts 

we have not historically experienced material order cancellations 

the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our five product groups established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years we include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods for presentation purposes we allocate maintenance revenue which represented approximately 9 14 and 16 of our total revenue in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively to the products to which those support services related 

 

  

revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 11 13 and 11 of our total revenue for the fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

research and development 

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms and to expand our design for manufacturing and ip product offerings research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group in addition an advanced technology group within synopsys’ silicon engineering group explores new technologies and maintains strong research relationships outside synopsys with both industry and academia 

during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 research and development expenses excluding capitalized software development costs were 3706 million 3209 million and 2888 million respectively synopsys’ capitalized software development costs were approximately 35 million 30 million and 27 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

competition 

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse timetoresults postsale support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms 

our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation and companies that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process such as magma design automation inc in recent years we have increasingly competed on the basis of payment terms and price in certain situations in order to win business we must offer substantial discounts on our products due to competitive factors in other situations we may lose potential business to a competitor offering a lower price 

product sales and licensing agreements 

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network including in some cases regional or global networks license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 

in certain cases we provide our customers the right to “remix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for backend placement software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product the customer’s remix of product when so provided under the customer agreement does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer which is governed by our revenue recognition policies the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor at the same time because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without remix rights 

we currently offer our software products under various license types including renewable tsls term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations — revenue background  

with respect to our designware core intellectual property products we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties 

finally our global technical services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project 

proprietary rights 

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future 

under our customer agreements and other license agreements in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights for example we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense 

employees 

as of october 31 2006 synopsys had 5130 employees with 2842 based in north america and 2288 based outside of north america 

acquisitions in fiscal 2006 

for information about acquisitions we completed during fiscal 2006 please see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview and note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference here 




 item 1a   risk factors 

weakness budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our business 

in recent years we believe that eda industry growth has been adversely affected by many factors including ongoing efforts by semiconductor companies to control their spending uncertainty regarding the longterm growth rate of the semiconductor industry excess eda tool capacity of some of our customers and increased competition in the eda industry itself causing pricing pressure on eda vendors if these factors persist or additional semiconductor industry growth does not occur or if we do not benefit from any such increases our business operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 

we also believe that over the long term growth in eda spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor rd spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market however we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues rd spending or spending on eda products nor whether we will benefit from any of these increases should they occur for example although the semiconductor industry grew by 28 in 2004 and 7 in 2005 eda industry revenue growth during this period was below these levels 

competition in the eda industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we compete with other eda vendors that offer a broad range of products and services primarily cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation and with other eda vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process such as magma design automation inc we also compete with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities if we fail to compete effectively our business will be materially and adversely affected we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeof use timetoresults postsale support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms 

additional competitive challenges include the following 

·   price continues to be a competitive factor  we believe that some eda vendors are increasingly offering discounts which could be significant if we are unable to match a competitor’s pricing for a particular solution we may lose business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other eda purchase with the competitor

·   technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly  accordingly we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments innovate rapidly and efficiently improve our existing products and successfully develop or acquire new products if we fail to do so our business will be materially and adversely affected

·   to compete effectively we believe we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance   we have invested significant resources into further development of our galaxy design platform integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of its system verilog and other advanced features and development of our design for manufacturing and ip portfolios we can provide no assurance that our customers will find these tool and ip configurations more attractive than our competitors’ offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance will be successful

·   payment terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated by our customers  during the second half of fiscal 2003 and continuing through 2006 payment terms on timebased licenses lengthened compared to prior periods negatively affecting our cash flow from 

operations longer payment terms could continue in the future which would negatively affect our future operating cash flow 

lack of growth in new ic design starts industry consolidation and other potentially longterm trends may adversely affect the eda industry including demand for our products and services 

the increasing complexity of socs and ics and customers’ concerns about managing cost and risk have also led to the following potentially longterm negative trends 

·   the number of ic design starts has remained flat during the last three years new ic design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for eda software

·   a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including synopsys

·   due to factors such as increased globalization cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent adversely impacting our customers’ eda spending

·   industry changes plus the cost and complexity of ic design may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design or using field programmable gate arrays fpgas an alternative chip technology

all of these trends if sustained could have a material adverse effect on the eda industry including the demand for our products and services which in turn would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects including changes to our prior financial statements which could cause our stock price to decline 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or in our interpretations of these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results 

for example in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab 108 sab 108 addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet iron curtain and an income statement rollover approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered is material in the year of adoption sab 108 allows a onetime cumulative effect transition adjustment for errors that were not previously deemed material but are material under the guidance in sab 108 the guidance in sab 108 must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 synopsys will be required to adopt the provisions of sab 108 in fiscal 2007 synopsys is currently evaluating the requirements of sab 108 and the potential impact upon adoption historically synopsys has evaluated uncorrected differences utilizing the “rollover” approach although synopsys believes its prior period assessments of uncorrected differences utilizing the “rollover” approach and the conclusions reached regarding its quantitative and qualitative assessments of such uncorrected differences were appropriate synopsys expects that due to the analysis required in sab 108 certain historical uncorrected differences 

during fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2003 related to sharebased compensation and fixed assets will be corrected upon adoption and reflected in the opening retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007 there can be no assurance that the sec will not disagree with our conclusions 

synopsys has not yet completed its analysis of sab 108 however it estimates that the expected net reduction to its opening retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007 will be approximately 10 to 12 million synopsys is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting sab 108 and as a result the actual change to opening retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007 could be different than the estimate 

in addition effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 synopsys was required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  sfas123r which requires the measurement of all sharebased compensation to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations the adoption of sfas 123r had and is expected to continue to have a material effect on our reported financial results 

we have received a revenue agent’s report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our us taxable income an adverse outcome of this examination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions and to review or audit by irs and state local and foreign tax authorities in connection with an irs audit of our united states federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 on june 8 2005 we received a revenue agent’s report in which the irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately 4768 million plus interest interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate which adjusts quarterly this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a whollyowned foreign subsidiary we have filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs and the matter is currently under appeal with the irs we expect to begin the appeals process during 2007 however final resolution of this matter could take a considerable time possibly years 

we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals accordingly we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously while we believe the irs’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law we believe it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter however based on our analysis to date we believe we have adequately provided for this matter if we determine our provision for this matter to be inadequate or if we are required to pay a significant amount of additional us taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for this matter our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

unfavorable tax law changes an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in our tax expense 

in addition our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also undergoing an audit of our united states federal 

income tax returns for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit there could be a material adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

finally we have large operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates in addition certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates therefore any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions and expiration of foreign tax holidays could materially increase our effective tax rate 

our revenue and earnings fluctuate which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline 

many factors affect our revenue and earnings including customer demand license mix the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold and committed expense levels making it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period accordingly stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance if our financial results or targets do not meet investor and analyst expectations our stock price could decline 

some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include but are not limited to 

·   we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income

·   our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and timebased licenses the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders customer demand preferred customer payment terms and requested customer ship dates could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings for example if we ship more upfront licenses than expected during any given fiscal period our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target conversely if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target similarly if we receive a lowerthanexpected level of timebased license orders during a given period our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected

·   we may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externallycommunicated financial targets any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could adversely affect our business

·   the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers’ products customer rd and eda tool budgets pricing our competitors’ product offerings and customer design starts it is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customer’s demand for our products on a medium or long term basis as a result actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which in turn could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publiclydisclosed targets

·   we often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products although these amendments can provide a longerterm payment stream from the customers they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger

·   certain of our upfront and timebased license agreements provide customers the right to remix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products while this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately

·   in the past we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter the delay of one or more orders particularly an upfront order could have a material adverse effect on our revenue andor earnings for that quarter

·   we make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition specifically determining the existence of proper documentation establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable verifying delivery of our software and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers while we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future in such an event we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods

·   our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products either alone or against competing products before making a purchase decision accordingly our customers’ evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters further sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles

the failure to meet the semiconductor industry’s demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may adversely affect our financial result s

soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing to address greater complexity semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers at the same time as a general business trend we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs failure to manage these conflicting demands successfully would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

customer payment defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our backlog consists principally of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered these customer obligations are typically not cancelable but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed in these cases we will generally take legal action to recover amounts owed moreover existing customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses though we have not to date experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project 

we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future 

in addition to direct costs acquisitions pose a number of risks including 

·   potential negative impact on our earnings per share

·   failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales

·   problems in integrating the acquired products with our products

·   difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company

·   failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings

·   regulatory delays

·   drain on management time for acquisitionrelated activities

·   assumption of unknown liabilities and

·   adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships

while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will positively affect our future performance furthermore if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology we could be required to write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the product or technology any such writedowns could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

stagnation of foreign economies foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance 

during each of fiscal 2006 and 2005 we derived 49 of our revenue from outside the united states going forward we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from outside the united states foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic political and health conditions including the effects of international political conflict hostilities and natural disasters further any stagnation of foreign economies would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states 

our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations can be adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies including the euro the japanese yen and the canadian dollar as a result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business results of operations and financial condition while we hedge certain foreign currency exposures of our business there can be no assurance our hedging activities will completely mitigate our foreign currency risks 

in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions locally and higher international sales this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states the failure to effectively manage our global operations would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 

under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are 

from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights for example we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company in addition we are currently in patent litigation with magma design inc one of our competitors we believe these claims are without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue them 

these types of claims can however result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

a failure to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology to protect this technology we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide we can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors moreover certain foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited we have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies for example we are pursuing antipiracy cases against several companies located in china however there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation may reduce our net income 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulated organizations including the sec nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board many of these regulations have only recently been enacted and continue to evolve making compliance more difficult and uncertain in addition our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

in particular section 404 of sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and auditor attestation of that assessment in our annual reports this effort has required and will continue to require in the future the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain our auditors’ attestation could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

a failure to timely recruit and retain key employees or for any reorganizations to be effective would have a material adverse effect on our business 

to be successful we must attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales 

and managerial employees would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we may reorganize our operations for a number of reasons including to better address customer needs improve operational efficiency and reduce expenses while we undertake any such reorganization with the expectation that it will result in improve performance there can be no assurance that a reorganization will in fact improve our operations or that it will not lead to the loss of key employees 

we issue stock options and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation there is growing pressure on public companies from stockholders who must approve any increases in our stock option pool generally to reduce our overhang or amount of outstanding and unexercised stock options in addition our adoption of new accounting rules that require us to recognize on our income statement compensation expense from employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan may increase pressure to limit future option grants these factors may make it more difficult for synopsys to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

as a result of acquisitions we have assumed leases in a number of foreign and domestic locations following each acquisition where feasible we consolidate the acquired company’s employees and operations into our existing local sites in such cases we generally seek to sublease the assumed space or negotiate with the landlord to terminate the underlying lease 

we believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs 




 item 3   legal proceedings 

synopsys v magma design automation inc 

in september 2004 synopsys filed suit against magma design automation inc magma in us district court for the northern district of california alleging infringement by magma of three patents in april 2006 the parties proceeded to trial on the issue of ownership of these patents the ownership trial as the ruling from the ownership trial remains pending in december 2006 synopsys filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to require magma to withdraw its claim of ownership on the patents considered during the ownership trial in january 2007 the court granted synopsys’ motion and directed magma to transfer record title to synopsys the court has not yet issued a final ruling on the question of ownership a second trial the infringement trial will be required in order to determine the relief that should issue in connection with any infringement of the synopsys patents however the court has not yet scheduled the infringement trial 

in september 2005 synopsys filed two additional actions against magma one of the actions filed in the superior court of california and later removed to the us district court for the northern district of california alleges that magma engaged in actions that constitute common law and statutory unfair business practices in that action magma filed a motion to dismiss which remains under submission in the remaining action synopsys asserted three patents against magma in us district court for the district of delaware in its answer and counterclaims magma asserted patents against synopsys and alleged that synopsys has engaged in various practices that constitute antitrust violations and has violated various state laws magma seeks declaratory relief that the patents asserted by synopsys are invalid or unenforceable magma also seeks an injunction prohibiting synopsys from infringing the patents it has asserted and seeks unspecified damages synopsys has filed an answer denying magma’s allegations and asserting that the magma patents at issue are either unenforceable or invalid a trial on these issues has been scheduled for june 2007 

synopsys believes magma’s claims in all actions are without merit and is vigorously contesting them 

irs revenue agent’s report 

on june 8 2005 we received a revenue agent’s report rar in which the internal revenue service irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately 4768 million plus interest interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate which adjusts quarterly 

this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a whollyowned foreign subsidiary the proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total amount relating to these transactions asserted under the irs theories 

on july 13 2005 we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs which caused the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs we expect to begin the appeals process during 2007 however final resolution of this matter could take a considerable time possibly years we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals accordingly we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously while we believe the irs’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law we believe it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter however based on our analysis to date we believe we have adequately provided for this matter if we determine our provision for this matter to be inadequate or are required to pay a significant amount of additional us taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for this matter our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

other proceedings 

we are also subject to other routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on synopsys because of the defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this report please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part 1 of this report regarding forwardlooking statements 

business environment 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services largely out of their research and development rd budgets and to a lesser extent their manufacturing and capital budgets as a result our customers’ business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs heavily influence our business 

since the 2000 through 2002 semiconductor downturn and subsequent recovery our customers have focused significantly on expense reductions including in their rd budgets this expense outlook has affected us in a number of ways first some customers have reduced their eda expenditures by decreasing their level of eda tool purchases using older generations of eda products or by not renewing maintenance services second customers bargain more intensely on pricing and payment terms which has affected revenues industrywide for example customers’ desire to conserve cash by paying for licenses over time resulted in a shift of our license mix to an almost completely ratable model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 in which substantially more revenue is recognized over time rather than at the time of shipment this shift adversely affected our total revenue in fiscal 2004 2005 and 2006 third some customers are consolidating their eda purchases with fewer suppliers in order to lower their overall cost of ownership while at the same time meeting new technology challenges this has increased competition among eda vendors 

recognizing that our customers will continue to spend cautiously and will work to aggressively contain costs we are intensely focused on improving our customers’ overall economics of design by providing more fully integrated design solutions and offering customers the opportunity to consolidate their eda spending with us over the long term we believe eda industry spending growth will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor rd spending and on continued growth in the overall semiconductor market the semiconductor industry association has forecasted modest growth in semiconductor revenues during 2007 and we believe semiconductor rd spending will grow as well however we cannot currently predict whether this outlook will contribute to higher eda industry spending 

fiscal 2006 product developments 

during fiscal 2006 we announced or introduced a number of new products and product developments including 

·   availability of our primeyield tool suite that helps integrate design with manufacturing by predicting designinduced mechanisms that threaten manufacturing tolerances and by providing automated correction guidance to upstream implementation tools

·   release of enhancements to our tetramax automatic test pattern generation product that result in a typical speedup of three times or more in runtime performance compared with the previous version

·   availability of a new family of processaware designformanufacturing products that analyze variability effects at the customanalog design stage for 45nanometer and smaller designs

·   availability of designware usb 20 nanophy intellectual property ip for mobile high volume consumer devices tailored specifically for low power consumption small chip area and high manufacturing yield

·   our designware verification ip became the first to support the system verilog language and methodology decreasing the cost of test bench development and helping designers reduce risk and meet project schedules

·   availability of simulation software from our acquisition of sigmac software ag that allows semiconductor manufacturers and their suppliers to develop and optimize process sequences for optical lithography ebeam lithography and nextgeneration lithography technologies

fiscal 2006 financial performance summary 

·   revenue was 10956 million up 10 from 9919 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in timebased license revenue from orders booked in prior periods which more than offset a decrease in service revenue recognized during fiscal 2006

·   timebased license revenue increased 18 from 7437 million in fiscal 2005 to 8749 million in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting the continuation of our highly ratable license model for an additional four quarters combined with increased business levels in earlier quarters

·   upfront license revenue increased 4 from 605 million in fiscal 2005 to 631 million in fiscal 2006 within our target range due to normal fluctuations in customer demand for upfront licenses

·   we derived approximately 7 of our software license revenue from upfront licenses and 93 from timebased licenses in fiscal 2006 versus approximately 8 and 92 respectively in fiscal 2005 within our target range for ratable license revenue

·   maintenance revenue declined by 24 from 1363 million in fiscal 2005 to 1031 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of nonrenewal of maintenance by some of our existing perpetual license customers and the continuing shift to a larger percentage of timebased licenses in which maintenance is bundled and not charged separately professional service and other revenue at 545 million increased 6 from 514 million in fiscal 2005 due to the timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing contracts

·   net income was 247 million compared to a net loss of 171 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to increased revenue and reduced cost of goods sold arising from reduced amortization expense this increase was partially offset by increased research and development expenses driven by acquisitions and increased investment in our core products commencement of sharebased compensation expense under sfas 123r in fiscal 2006 and the absence of a large litigation settlement received in fiscal 2005

·   we repurchased approximately 100 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 1994 per share for a total of approximately 2000 million

·   operating cash flow decreased 24 from 2692 million in fiscal 2005 to 2059 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of increased payments to vendors increased commission and bonus payments and the timing of billings on timebased license agreements in addition in fiscal 2005 operating income included a 33 million litigation settlement gain relating to the acquisition of nassda corporation

fiscal 2006 acquisitions 

during fiscal 2006 we acquired 1 hpl technologies inc a provider of yield management and test chip products that will allow designers to better address defects at the ic design phase 2 virtio corporation a creator of virtual platforms for embedded software development which will help us provide an integrated implementation verification and ip solution to speed up hardware and software development and 3 sigmac software ag a munichbased company providing simulation software that will allow semiconductor manufacturers and their suppliers to develop and optimize process sequences for optical lithography ebeam lithography and nextgeneration lithography technologies see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial statements which we prepare in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing these financial statements we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates 

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

·   revenue recognition

·   valuation of intangible assets

·   income taxes and

·   valuation of sharebased compensation

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from software licenses and maintenance and service revenue software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees 

we have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with statement of position sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended 

with respect to software licenses we utilize three license types 

·   technology subscription licenses tsls  are timebased licenses for a finite term and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for unspecified future technology we bundle and do not charge separately for postcontract customer support maintenance for the term of the license

·   term licenses are also for a finite term but do not provide the customer any rights to receive or to exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee

·   perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive or to exchange 

licensed software for unspecified future technology customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 

for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

·   tsls we typically recognize revenue from tsl fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period or as customer installments become due and payable whichever is later revenue attributable to tsls is reported as “timebased revenue” in the statement of operations

·   term licenses we recognize the term license fee in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75 of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the statement of operations for term licenses in which less than 75 of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable such revenue is reported as “timebased revenue” in the statement of operations

·   perpetual licenses we recognize the perpetual license fee in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75 of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront revenue” in the statement of operations for perpetual licenses in which less than 75 of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “timebased revenue” in the statement of operations

in addition we recognize revenue from maintenance fees associated with term and perpetual licenses ratably over the maintenance period and recognize revenue from professional service and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer revenue attributable to maintenance professional services and training is reported as “service revenue” in the statement of operations 

our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately 

we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and we recognize revenue from professional services as the related services are performed and accepted we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 

we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery of software or services has occurred 3 the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable and 4 collectibility of the full license or service fee is probable all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 

·   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement our customary policy is to have a written contract signed by both the customer and us or a purchase 

order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard enduser license arrangement or purchase agreement 

·   delivery has occurred we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically for physical deliveries the standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point for electronic deliveries delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or “license keys” that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it to the customer’s hardware we generally ship our software products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders however a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and as a result timing of revenue recognition including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill software license orders at the end of a quarter

·   the fee is fixed or determinable our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms our standard payment terms require 75 or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year if the arrangement includes these terms we regard the fee as fixed or determinable and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met if the arrangement does not include these terms we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable in the case of a tsl we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable due to the fact that vsoe for maintenance services does not exist for a tsl and due to revenue recognition criteria relating to arrangements that include rights to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology

·   collectibility is probable we judge collectibility of the arrangement fees on a customerbycustomer basis pursuant to our credit review policy we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection for a new customer or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer if we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received

valuation of intangible assets   we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customerinstalled baserelationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete customer backlog capitalized software and other intangibles factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2006 as of october 31 2006 the carrying amount of our intangible assets net was 1061 million

income taxes   we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 our estimates and assumptions used in such provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified and resolved

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized if we determine that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets we record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states if the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future we would provide taxes on such excess amount as of october 31 2006 there was approximately 310 million in earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 

in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities we would record an additional charge to earnings see results of operations—income taxes—irs revenue agent’s report below  and note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of a revenue agent’s report from the internal revenue service irs we received in june 2005 asserting a very large net increase to our us tax arising from the audit of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 

valuation of sharebased compensation   effective november 1 2005 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r using the modified prospective method sfas 123r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments such as stock options stock purchase rights restricted stock or restricted stock units for goods or services such as the services of the entity’s employees sfas 123r also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments sfas 123r eliminates the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires instead that these transactions be accounted for using a fairvalue based method accordingly we measure sharebased compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the employee’s requisite service period using the straightline attribution method the measurement of sharebased compensation cost is based on several criteria including but not limited to the valuation model used and associated input factors such as expected term of the award stock price volatility risk free interest rate and award cancellation rate these input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s 

judgment if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining sharebased compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time we may change the input factors used in determining future sharebased compensation costs any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services under current accounting rules and policies we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and services at varying times in general we recognize revenue on a timebased software license order quarterly over the license term and on an upfront term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is shipped substantially all of our current timebased licenses are tsls with an average license term of approximately three years maintenance orders generally generate revenue ratably over the maintenance period normally one year professional service orders generally generate revenue upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under critical accounting policies and estimates  

our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront license maintenance and professional service revenue for the period we derive timebased license revenue in any quarter almost entirely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters we derive upfront license revenue directly from upfront term and perpetual license orders booked and shipped during the quarter we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional service revenue almost entirely from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted not when they are booked 

our license revenue is very sensitive to the mix of timebased and upfront licenses delivered during the quarter a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters conversely upfront licenses generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg a 120000 order for an upfront license generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped but no future revenue tsls also result in a shift of maintenance revenue to timebased license revenue since maintenance is included in revenue reported for tsls while maintenance on upfront orders is charged and reported separately 

total revenue 

 

  

the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to an increase in timebased license revenue from orders booked in prior periods which more than offset a decrease in service revenue during the fiscal 2006 the decrease in total revenue for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to our license model shift begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which significantly reduced both upfront license fees and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2005 

timebased license revenue 

 

  

the increase in timebased license revenue in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily reflecting the continuation of our highly ratable license model for an additional four quarters under which previously booked orders continue to contribute to revenue in later periods combined with increased business levels in earlier quarters the increase in timebased license revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to our fourth quarter fiscal 2004 license model shift  

upfront license revenue 

 

  

the slight increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to normal fluctuations in customer demand for upfront licenses following the adoption of our highly ratable license model the significant decrease in upfront license revenue in both percentage and absolute dollar terms for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the fact that we shipped a substantially higherthanaverage percentage of orders as upfront licenses in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2004 and subsequently shifted to a higher ratable license mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 

maintenance and service revenue 

 

  

our maintenance revenue has declined due to 1 the decrease in our upfront licenses which reduces new maintenance orders since maintenance is purchased separately with upfront licenses 2 generally lower maintenance rates on large perpetual transactions and 3 nonrenewal of maintenance by certain customers on perpetual or other upfront licenses with our license model shift we expect progressively more of our maintenance revenue will be included in timebased license revenue and therefore for our separately recognized maintenance revenue to continue to decline in addition some customers may continue to choose in the future not to renew maintenance on upfront licenses for economic or other factors which would adversely affect future maintenance revenue 

professional service and other revenue increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due to timing of performance milestones under ongoing contracts 

events affecting cost of revenues and operating expenses 

certain option expenses as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 31 2005 subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we discovered an error in our option grant process related to the documentation of grant dates this error was solely with respect to grants to nonexecutive officer employees we recorded 36 million in fiscal 2005 relating to this error as follows 05 million in cost of goods sold 13 million in research and development expense 09 million in sales and marketing expense and 09 million in general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we booked 16 million in relation to this error as follows 02 million in cost of goods sold 08 million in research and development expense 04 million in sales and marketing expense and 02 million in general and administrative expense finally we expect to recognize an aggregate of approximately 12 million 05 million and 01 million of expense relating to this error in fiscal 2007 2008 and 2009 the error was not material to any prior fiscal year’s results of operations

temporary shutdown of operations  as a cost saving measure we temporarily shut down operations in north america for three days during the first quarters of fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and for four days during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 resulting in savings of approximately 35 million in fiscal 2006 44 million in fiscal 2005 and 76 million in fiscal 2004 the savings in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 relate primarily to salaries and benefits and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows

 

  

functional allocation of operating expenses 

we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or other factors management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool 

cost of revenue 

 

  

we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of intangible assets expenses directly associated with providing consulting and training have been segregated from costs of revenue associated with internal functions which provide license delivery and postcustomer contract support services these group costs are then allocated by management between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and service revenue reported during the quarter 

cost of license revenue   cost of license revenue includes costs associated with the sale and licensing of our software products both timebased and upfront cost of license revenue includes the allocated cost of employee salary and benefits for providing software delivery including software production costs product packaging amortization of capitalized software development costs related to synopsys products documentation and royalties payable to third party vendors

cost of maintenance and service revenue   cost of maintenance and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting professionals and associated costs to maintain the related infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization further cost of maintenance and service revenue includes allocated costs of employee salary and benefits for providing customer services such as hotline and onsite support production services and documentation of maintenance updates

amortization of intangible assets   see amortization of intangible assets below for information regarding the amount of amortization charged to cost of revenue for the relevant periods

the decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease of 530 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from completion of amortization of certain intangible assets primarily acquired in the acquisition of avant corporation in june 2002 this decrease was partially offset by increases of 1 recognition of 92 million in sharebased compensation expense due to adoption of sfas 123r 2 61 million in compensation and employee benefits due to our increased investment in personnel through acquisitions including 10 million in compensation due to former ise integrated systems engineering ag employees based on achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones and 3 58 million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased allocable expenses 

the decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to 1 net reduction of 207 million in amortization expense in coredeveloped technology caused by completion of amortization from fiscal 2002 acquisitions partially offset by amortization charges from the ise and nassda acquisitions and 2 the reduction in royalty expense of 13 million primarily resulting from reversal of a 10 million accrual recorded in fiscal 2004 for a potential payment ultimately not required to be paid this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 1 140 million in compensation and employee benefits as a result of a our increased investment in professional services personnel and 

b higher variable compensation associated with our higherthanexpected business performance 2 12 million in compensation due to former ise employees based on achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones and 3 32 million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2004 as a result of increased allocable expenses 

operating expenses 

research and development 

 

  

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to 1 recognition of 280 million in sharebased compensation expense due to adoption of sfas 123r 2 an increase of 126 million in research and development personnelrelated costs as a result of acquisitions including 45 million in compensation due to former ise employees now employed by synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones and 3 an increase of 89 million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased corporatewide allocable expenses 

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to 1 an increase of 309 million in research and development personnel and related costs primarily as a result of the ise and nassda corporation acquisitions including 53 million in compensation due to former ise employees now employed by synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones and 2 an increase of 47 million in human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 27 million in contractor costs as former contractors in lowercost regions were converted to employees 

sales and marketing 

 

  

the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to 1 an 106 million reduction in variable compensation driven by shipments relative to our operating plan 2 a 24 million reduction in sales and marketing personnelrelated costs due to reductions in headcount and 3 the absence in fiscal 2006 of 64 million in costs associated with a reduction in force made during fiscal 2005 this decrease was partially offset by 1 recognition of 162 million in sharebased compensation expense due to adoption of sfas 123r and 2 an increase of 12 million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased allocable expenses 

the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to 1 an increase of 278 million in variable compensation driven by shipments higher commission rates applied to shipments beginning in fiscal 2005 and increased business performancerelated compensation 2 an increase of 46 million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs due to increased headcount and acquisitions during the fiscal year and 3 an increase of 46 million in severancerelated costs associated with a workforce reduction executed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 these increases were partially offset by decreases of 1 42 million as a result of a reduction in expenses for sales conferences and related meetings 2 16 million in human resources information technology and facilities corporate allocated costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 as a result of decreased headcount 3 12 million related to reduced depreciation to this line item and 4 10 million related to reduced travel expenses 

general and administrative 

 

  

the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to 1 recognition of 95 million in sharebased compensation expense due to adoption of sfas 123r 2 an increase of 31 million in facilities costs and property taxes 3 an increase of 97 million in professional services expenses related to litigation matters audit activities sarbanes oxley act compliance and tax services 4 an increase of 32 million as a result of reduction in bad debt reserve taken in fiscal 2005 in excess of those taken in fiscal 2006 and 5 an increase of 22 million in telecommunication and networking expenses this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 1 32 million decrease in compensation expense primarily related to reduction in headcount 2 21 million decrease in travel employee training and functions and other related costs and 3 154 million decrease in corporate allocated expenses including human resources information technology and facilities costs 

fiscal 2004 general and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005 primarily due to 1 the 10 million merger termination fee paid to monolithic system technology inc mosys in april 2004 in connection with termination of an acquisition agreement 2 54 million in professional service fees primarily related to litigation associated with the mosys termination incurred in 2004 3 17 million in professional services fees incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition of mosys expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 4 a decrease of 32 million in bad debt reserve in fiscal 2005 due to lower than anticipated billings and successful collection efforts 5 a decrease of 19 million in facilities costs in fiscal 2005 due to closure of certain facilities and 6 a decrease of 63 million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources information technology and facilities costs lower fiscal 2005 expenses were partially offset by an increase of 1 35 million in employee compensation in fiscal 2005 due to increased headcount 2 22 million in depreciation due to additional equipment and assets acquired and used this functional area and 3 27 million in consulting costs primarily related to market and internal business process analyses see “ functional allocation of operating expenses ” above 

inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd expense is comprised of inprocess technologies of 1 08 million associated with the acquisition of hpl in fiscal 2006 2 57 million associated with the acquisition of ise in fiscal 2005 and 3 16 million associated with an immaterial acquisition in fiscal 2004 at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet 

reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses accordingly these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

valuation of iprd   the value assigned to acquired inprocess technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date the value of inprocess technology is then divided into two classifications 1 developed technology completed and 2 inprocess technology tobecompleted giving explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and expected to be created by synopsys after the acquisition these value creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors 1 timebased data 2 costbased data and 3 complexitybased data

the value of the inprocess technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model that focuses on the income producing capabilities of the inprocess technologies under this approach the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified products revenue estimates were based on 1 individual product revenues 2 anticipated growth rates 3 anticipated product development and introduction schedules 4 product sales cycles and 5 the estimated life of a product’s underlying technology from the revenue estimates operating expense estimates including costs of sales general and administrative sales and marketing income taxes and a use charge for contributory assets were deducted to arrive at operating income we estimated revenue growth rates for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors expected industry trends the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product’s underlying technology operating expense estimates reflect synopsys’ historical expense ratios the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition 

the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology is our weightedaverage cost of capital taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at this time 

hpl on december 7 2005 we acquired hpl technologies inc hpl a yield management and test chip technology company the iprd expense related to the hpl acquisition was 08 million hpl had one iprd project  yielddirector this project was completed during fiscal 2006 and the resulting products have begun to generate revenue the expenditures to complete hpl’s acquired inprocess technologies approximated the original estimates

ise   on november 2 2004 we acquired ise a leading provider of tcad technology computeraided design software and related services the iprd expense related to the ise acquisition was 57 million ise had one iprd project—floops a next generation process simulator

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in prior years amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows

 

  

amortization of capitalized software development costs is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to completion of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of avant 

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is driven by completion of the amortization of the intangible assets related to coredeveloped technology from fiscal 2002 acquisitions partially offset by amortization charges from the ise and nassda acquisitions 

see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts which is incorporated by reference here 

impairment of intangible assets   there were no impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal 2006 2005 or 2004

other income net 

 

1   for the fiscal year ended october 31 2006 these amounts are comprised primarily of 55 million in investment earnings related to the change in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan assets partially offset by 30 million in premiums paid on foreign exchange forward contracts for the fiscal year ended october 31 2005 the amount included a 33 million litigation settlement gain relating to 

the acquisition of nassda corporation and 58 million in the fair value increase of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 we reevaluated our interpretation of certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivatives and hedging sfas 133 resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of the our hedging program to correct the error we reclassified the remaining 30 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the fiscal year ended october 31 2005 see notes 2 and 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

income taxes 

the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as of october 31 2006 current deferred tax assets net of current deferred tax liabilities totaled 1123 million noncurrent deferred tax assets net of noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled 2031 million we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would record a charge to income and an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination 

we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states if the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future we would provide taxes on such excess amount as of october 31 2006 there was approximately 310 million earnings upon which income taxes have not been provided 

effective tax rate 

the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended october 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

  

for fiscal year 2006 the effective tax rate includes state tax expense of 55 million for prior year state taxes primarily as a result of state tax audits settled and a settlement offer made in fiscal 2006 and associated interest and penalties as well as a reduction in an estimated fiscal 2005 state research and development credit benefit in addition as required by sfas 123r no tax benefit was recorded in the fiscal year ended october 31 2006 for expenses relating to qualified stock options and sharebased compensation costs which are borne by our foreign subsidiaries 

for fiscal year 2005 the effective tax rate includes the impact of 116 million tax expense associated with repatriation of approximately 1850 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 for fiscal year 2004 the effective tax rate reflects the tax benefit derived from higher earnings in lowtax jurisdictions 

during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to a tax accounting method change there was a decrease of 832 million in the current deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase in noncurrent deferred tax assets in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 we changed our tax accounting method on our tax return for fiscal year 2005 with respect to the current portion of deferred revenue to follow the recognition of revenue under us generally accepted accounting principles this accounting method change as well as other adjustments made to our taxable income upon the filing of the fiscal year 2005 tax return resulted in an increase in our operating loss nol carryforwards 

in may 2006 the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 was enacted which provides a threeyear exception to current us taxation of certain foreign intercompany income this provision will first apply to synopsys in fiscal year 2007 management estimates that had such provisions been applied for fiscal 2006 our income tax expense would have been reduced by approximately 3 million 

in december 2006 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 was enacted which retroactively extended the research and development credit from january 1 2006 as a result we will record an expected increase in our fiscal 2006 research and development credit of between 15 million and 18 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

revision of prior year financial statements   as part of our remediation of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting identified in fiscal 2005 relating to accounting for income taxes we implemented additional internal control and review procedures through such procedures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we identified four errors totaling 82 million which affected our income tax provision in fiscal years 2001 through 2005 we concluded that these errors were not material to any prior year financial statements although the errors are not material to prior periods we elected to revise prior year financial statements to correct such errors the fiscal periods in which the errors originated and the resulting change in provision benefit for income taxes for each year are reflected in the following table

 

  

the errors were as follows 1 synopsys inadvertently provided a 14 million tax benefit for the writeoff of goodwill relating to an acquisition in fiscal 2002 2 synopsys did not accrue interest and penalties for certain foreign tax contingency items in the amount of 32 million 3 synopsys made certain computational errors relating to foreign dividends of 23 million and 4 synopsys did not record a valuation allowance relating to certain state tax credits of 13 million as result of this revision noncurrent deferred tax assets decreased by 81 million and current taxes payable increased by 02 million retained earnings decreased by 82 million and additional paid in capital decreased by 01 million see item 9a controls and procedures for a further discussion of our remediation of the material weakness 

tax effects of stock awards   in november 2005 fasb issued a staff position fsp on fas 123r3 transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards effective upon issuance this fsp describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of sharebased compensation pursuant to sfas 123r the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paidin capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee sharebased compensation 

awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas 123r we elected to use the alternative transition method in fiscal 2006 and have not recognized any excess tax benefits during fiscal 2006 

irs revenue agent’s report   on june 8 2005 we received a revenue agent’s report rar in which the internal revenue service “irs” proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately 4768 million plus interest interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate which adjusts quarterly this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between the company and a whollyowned foreign subsidiary the proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total amount relating to these transactions asserted under the irs theories

on july 13 2005 we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs which caused the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs we expect to begin the appeals process during fiscal 2007 however final resolution of this matter could take a considerable time possibly years we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that synopsys thus has meritorious defenses to these proposals accordingly we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously while we believe the irs’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law we believe it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter however based on our analysis to date we believe we have adequately provided for this matter if we determine our provision for this matter to be inadequate or we are required to pay a significant amount of additional us taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for this matter our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

in the third quarter of 2006 the irs started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2004 as of the end of fiscal 2006 no adjustments had been proposed as a result of this audit 

repatriation of foreign earnings   the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs creation act provides for a special onetime elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to 85 of the eligible distribution during the fourth quarter of 2005 synopsys repatriated 3600 million of which approximately 1850 million qualified for the special onetime elective dividends received deduction and the balance of which constituted earnings that did not qualify under the jobs creation act previously taxed income and return of capital synopsys recorded tax expense of 116 million related to the repatriation of 360 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 our chief executive officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan drip to invest up to 1850 million in foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the jobs creation act as required by the jobs creation act the reinvestment plan was ratified by the board of directors in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 synopsys satisfied the drip reinvestment requirements during fiscal 2005

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 

the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2006 

cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 

 

  

during the year ended october 31 2006 our sources and uses of cash included 1 cash provided by operating activities of 2059 million 2 cash provided by issuance of common stock to employees of 696 million 3 acquisition of treasury stock of 2000 million 4 purchases of investments of 3669 million 5 proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 3055 million 6 purchases of plant and equipment of 485 million and 7 cash paid for business acquisitions of 411 million 

cash flows 

 

  

cash flows from operating activities   cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements for an upfront license we require that 75 of the license fee be paid within the first year conversely payment terms for timebased licenses are generally extended typically the license fee is paid quarterly in even increments over the term of the license accordingly we generally receive cash from upfront licenses much sooner than for timebased licenses

cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily as a result of increased payments to vendors increased commission and bonus payments and the timing of billing on timebased license agreements in addition in fiscal 2005 net income included a 33 million litigation settlement gain relating to the acquisition of nassda corporation 

cash flows from investing activities   the reduction in the cash used for investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities we also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth

cash flows from financing activities   the increased use of cash for financing activities primarily relate to a higher amount of stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program partially offset by increased proceeds from issuance of stock pursuant to exercises of stock options

we hold our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and in foreign accounts primarily in ireland bermuda and japan as of october 31 2006 we held an aggregate of 4341 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and an aggregate of 1386 million in foreign accounts funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america at present such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries see “income taxes” above 

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in the timing of our billings and collections our operating results the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions 

accounts receivable net 

 

  

the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increased billings during the fiscal year ended october 31 2006 days sales outstanding dso was 39 days at october 31 2006 and 36 days at october 31 2005 our accounts receivable and dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities 

net working capital 

working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our balance sheet as of october 31 2006 our working capital was 234 million compared to 1306 million as of october 31 2005 the decrease in net working capital of 1072 million was primarily due to 1 a decrease of 737 million in cash and cash equivalents 2 a decrease of current deferred tax assets of 832 million primarily due to a tax accounting method change 3 a decrease in income taxes receivable of 58 million 4 an increase in income taxes payable of 215 million 5 an increase in deferred revenue of 299 million and 6 a net increase of 28 million in accounts payable and other liabilities which included a reclassification of debt of 75 million from long term to short term debt this decrease was partially offset by 1 an increase in shortterm investments of 599 million 2 an increase in prepaid and other assets of 274 million which includes land of 234 million reclassified from property plant and equipment to asset held for sale within prepaid expense and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet and 3 an increase in accounts receivable of 224 million 

other commitments—revolving credit facility 

on october 20 2006 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to synopsys and certain of its foreign subsidiaries the facility replaces our previous 2500 million senior unsecured credit facility which was terminated effective october 20 2006 the amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional 1500 million through the fourth year of the facility the facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants the facility terminates on october 20 2011 borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 however we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 050 and 070 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant in addition commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0125 and 0175 per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant as of october 31 2006 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all the covenants 

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2006 

 

1   this commitment relates to the fees associated with the revolving credit facility additional information is provided in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

2   additional information is provided in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

3   purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october 31 2006 although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services

4   includes a approximately 61 million in promissory notes payable in september 2007 issued in connection with an acquisition in september 2002 and b a bond payable to the city of san jose for participating in a development project for land owned by us additional information is provided in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements  certain longterm liabilities reflected on our balance sheet such as unearned revenue are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future

in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to october 31 2006 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 146 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 113 million in cash during the two years subsequent to fiscal 2007 if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals these amounts are not reflected in the table above 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of our investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument

the following table presents the carrying value and related weightedaverage total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31 2006 

 

  

as of october 31 2006 the stated maturities of our current shortterm investments are 516 million within one year 912 million within one to five years 105 million within five to ten years and 887 million after ten years however we consider these investments to be shortterm in nature because in accordance with our investment policy the weightedaverage expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for shortterm obligations and other uses including acquisitions these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2006 that are subject to interest rate risk by calendar year of expected duration and average interest rates 

 

  

in comparison the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2005 that were subject to interest rate risk by calendar year of expected duration and average interest rates 

 

  

foreign currency risk   the functional currency of each of synopsys’ active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for our principal irish and swiss subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the us dollar we engage in a program to minimize the effect of changes in the exchange rate between a given functional currency ie the yen in the case of our japanese subsidiary and the corresponding nonfunctional currency transactions ie receivables denominated in the us dollar in the case of our japanese subsidiary we hedge the following types of nonfunctionalcurrencydenominated balances and transactions 1 certain assets and liabilities 2 shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month 3 future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and 4 certain future intercompany invoices denominated in the euro and british pound a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2006 

 

  

the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2005 

 

  

the amounts shown in the tables include the balances and transactions described above the maximum original duration of the currency contracts shown is 15 months for our euro forward contracts 12 months for our british pound forward contracts and one month for other currencies due to the short  term nature of these contracts the contract rates approximate fair value as of october 31 2006 and 2005 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 

for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table above providing information as of october 31 2006 the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 69 million and we would be required to pay approximately 69 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 69 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized losses of approximately 21 million and 06 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31 2006 and october 31 2005 respectively 

if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 synopsys reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of sfas 133 resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of synopsys’ hedging program to correct the error synopsys reclassified the remaining 30 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the three months ended january 31 2005 

foreign currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we have limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk furthermore we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes 

equity risk   our strategic investment portfolio as of october 31 2006 consists of approximately 49 million of minority equity investments in publicly traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately 81 million as of october 31 2005 the securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as availableforsale securities accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value during fiscal 2006 and 2005 we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by 13 million and 45 million respectively during the fiscal year ended october 31 2006 the prior investments of 19 million and 17 million in hpl and virtio were included in the purchase price none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

a   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of october 31 2006 the evaluation date synopsys carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of synopsys’ management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures 

accordingly even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving their control objectives nonetheless our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of october 31 2006 1 synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and 2 synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports synopsys files and submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported as and when required and that such information is accumulated and communicated to synopsys’ management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding its required disclosure 

b   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act for synopsys

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date in making this assessment our management used the framework established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

our management has concluded that as of the evaluation date our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an auditors’ report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting which is included herein 

c   changes in internal controls   our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 31 2005 disclosed a material weakness relating to accounting for income taxes in order to remediate this material weakness during fiscal 2006 we 1 implemented additional recurring review procedures to help ensure compliance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  and other applicable rules and regulations with respect to tax matters 2 engaged external tax advisors to assist in the review of our income tax calculations 3 implemented controls with respect to tracking the statute of limitations 4 increased contact and coordination between members of the corporate tax department and the vice president and corporate controller and other senior finance department management 5 completed a reorganization and increase in staffing in the corporate tax department as a result of these actions management has concluded that synopsys has remediated the material weakness other than as described above there were no changes in synopsys’ internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended october 31 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect synopsys’ internal control over financial reporting

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders synopsys inc 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9ab that synopsys inc the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso management of synopsys inc is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the teadway commission coso also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the teadway commission coso

the role of eda in the electronics industry 

technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density speed power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors also referred to as integrated circuits ics or chips 

·   since the early 1960s steadily decreasing feature widths the widths of the wires imprinted on the chip that form the transistors and other developments have enabled ic manufacturers to follow “moore’s law” approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip

·   chips have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones digital cameras music players and personal digital assistants

·   increasingly single systemsonachip socs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ics attached to a printed circuit board

combined these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower cost higher performance computers wireless communications networks hand held devices internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices each advance however has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and eda software suppliers such as synopsys 

these technological challenges have been accompanied by unprecedented business challenges stemming from the semiconductor downturn in 20002002 increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products 

the ic design process 

eda software enables designers to create complex semiconductors in simplified form the ic design process consists of the steps described below 

system design   in system design the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized highlevel computer language typically c  or system c this phase yields a relatively high level behavioral model of the chip

register transfer level rtl design   rtl design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level computer language typically verilog or vhdl

logic design   logic design or “synthesis” programs convert the rtl code into a logical diagram of the chip and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors or gates to be built on the chip

functional verification   at the rtl level of ic design the designer uses functional verification tools such as rtl simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended the increasing size and complexity of today’s ics and socs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs with verification estimated to consume 60 to 70 of total design time as a result designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds and that can reduce verification risk ie find design bugs before designs are taken into production

physical design   in the physical design stage the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with “place and route” products the designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip as well as the location for each transistor within each block a process known as “placement” in many designs placement is performed in 

conjunction with logic synthesis a process known as “physical synthesis” after placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors a process known as “routing” with increasing gate counts and design complexity seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important 

physical verification   before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication the designer must perform a series of further verification steps checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip

design for manufacturing   the design is then translated to a series of photomasks or physical representations of the design ic manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ics as ic wire or “feature” sizes shrink this translation is becoming more and more difficult these challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced technology computeraided design or tcad tools are also used to model individual features or “devices” within the design to help ensure manufacturability finally various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ics contained on each silicon wafer

intellectual property reuse   as ic designs continue to grow in size and complexity designers have found that inserting “predesigned and preverified” design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified usually such ip blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ics including microprocessors digital signal processors or connectivity ip that support such protocols as usb pci express or ethernet

strategy 

with increasing chip complexity designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially and must repeat some steps such as verification multiple times before finishing the design each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet timetomarket goals synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next 

in addition smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before synopsys has invested heavily in design for manufacturing tools and technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield 

finally designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition we address this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality preverified standardsbased and other ip which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence

synopsys leases approximately 45000 square feet in dublin ireland for its foreign headquarters and for research and development purposes this space is leased through april 2026 in addition synopsys leases foreign sales and service offices in canada denmark finland france germany hong kong india israel italy japan the netherlands the people’s republic of china singapore south korea sweden taiwan and the united kingdom we also lease research and development facilities in armenia canada france germany india the netherlands the people’s republic of china south korea taiwan and the united kingdom 

as a result of acquisitions we have assumed leases in a number of foreign and domestic locations following each acquisition where feasible we consolidate the acquired company’s employees and operations into our existing local sites in such cases we generally seek to sublease the assumed space or negotiate with the landlord to terminate the underlying lease 

we believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs 




 item 3   legal proceedings 

on august 25 2004 a class action complaint entitled kanekal v synopsys inc et al  no c043580 was filed in federal district court for the northern district of california against synopsys and certain of our officers alleging violations of the exchange act the complaint purported to be a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of persons who acquired synopsys stock during the period of december 3 2003 through august 18 2004 the complaint alleged that the individual defendants caused synopsys to make false and misleading statements about synopsys’ business forecasts and financial performance and that certain synopsys officers or employees sold portions of their stock holdings while in the possession of adverse nonpublic information the complaint did not specify the amount of damages sought in november 2004 the court appointed a lead plaintiff in the case in january 2005 the lead plaintiff the wu group filed an amended complaint synopsys filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and a motion for sanctions in march 2005 in august 2005 the court granted our motion to dismiss but denied the motion for sanctions and allowed the plaintiff 30 days to amend their complaint the parties stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice with each side bearing its own fees and costs and in september 2005 the case was dismissed

in connection with our december 1 2004 announcement that we had signed agreements to acquire nassda corporation nassda and to settle all outstanding litigation between the two companies a class action complaint entitled robert israel v nassda corporation et al  no 4705695 was filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware naming nassda its directors and synopsys as defendants the complaint purported to be a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of shareholders of nassda other than 

the defendant directors and their affiliates who allegedly would be injured or threatened with injury if the proposed acquisition of nassda by synopsys proceeded forward on the terms announced a class action complaint alleging substantially the same facts was also filed in california superior court the purported class actions sought to enjoin the transaction or alternatively unspecified damages in may 2005 synopsys completed its acquisition of nassda in october 2005 the chancery court approved a settlement of the delaware action by which synopsys would pay an aggregate of 015 per share to each former shareholder of nassda other than the defendant directors and their affiliates for a total of approximately 18 million and would pay certain fees and expenses of plaintiff’s counsel in december 2005 the plaintiffs in the delaware action dismissed their complaint with prejudice and synopsys paid the agreedupon amounts the california action was also dismissed with prejudice in december 2005 with each party bearing its own costs 

on may 31 2005 we received a notice of proposed adjustment from the internal revenue service irs asserting a very large net increase to our us taxable income arising from the audit of fiscal 2000 and 2001 on june 8 2005 we received a revenue agent’s report rar in which the irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately 4768 million plus interest interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate which adjusts quarterly a higher underpayment rate of interest may be charged as a result of the issuance of the rar on july 13 2005 we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs which will cause the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview—income tax rate—irs revenue agent’s report for a further discussion of this matter

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7 and by the risk factors set forth below under the caption entitled “factors that may affect future results” please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part 1 of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

synopsys’ business 

synopsys inc synopsys is a world leader in electronic design automation eda software and related services for semiconductor design we deliver technologyleading semiconductor design and verification software platforms and integrated circuit ic manufacturing software products to the global electronics market enabling the development and production of complex systemsonchips socs in addition we provide intellectual property ip and design services to simplify the design process and accelerate timetomarket for our customers we also provide software and services that help customers prepare their designs for manufacturing 

business environment 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services largely out of their research and development rd budgets as a result our customers’ business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs heavily influence our business 

beginning in late calendar 2000 the semiconductor industry experienced its steepest and longest downturn of the past 20 years semiconductor industry sales dropped approximately 46 from late 2000 to early 2002 and then recovered slowly into 2003 throughout this period our customers took many steps to reduce their expenses including constraining rd and eda expenditures reducing the number of design engineers they employed cutting back on their design starts purchasing from fewer suppliers and requiring more favorable pricing payment and license terms from those suppliers as well as pursuing consolidation within their own industry further during this downturn many semiconductor design companies failed or were acquired and the pace of investment in new companies declined 

historically growth in semiconductor sales has been followed by growth in semiconductor rd spending which in turn has led to subsequent growth in eda expenditures however although the semiconductor industry association sia reported semiconductor industry growth of approximately 18 in 2003 and 29 in 2004 and we believe rd spending among large semiconductor companies increased approximately 10 from 2003 to 2004 eda spending in 2003 and 2004 did not in fact track this upturn 

we believe this occurred for a number of reasons first in light of the severity of the 20002002 downturn we believe customers’ intense focus on expense reduction continued even after the downturn ended and that as a result they now generally approach spending more conservatively second the consumer electronics market in which product price is a primary competitive factor has been a key driver of the semiconductor industry’s recovery this price pressure has placed pressure on product development costs and rd spending third increased globalization has placed significant pressure on end user product prices and as a result product development costs finally we believe our customers became more cautious about their own business outlook in midcalendar 2004 due to a number of factors including lack of visibility into their own future results unexpected inventory buildup in the semiconductor supply chain and concerns about the industry’s growth prospects in 2005 these factors have caused our customers to continue to seek to control costs including by limiting their eda spending 

following the third quarter of fiscal 2004 we reevaluated the factors discussed above and the reduced customer demand for upfront licenses which have shorter payment terms than timebased licenses and which had accounted for approximately 26 of our license orders from august 2000 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 this reduced demand for upfront licenses materially and adversely affected both our bookings revenue and operating cash flow for the third quarter and fullyear fiscal 2004 recognizing our customers’ increased preference for conserving cash by paying for their licenses over time rather than upfront effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we shifted our target license mix to consist almost entirely of timebased licenses in which customers typically pay the license fee ratably over the term of the license as a result upfront licenses represented approximately 5 of our license orders in the five quarters since this shift 

we believe this model shift meets our customers’ needs improves the predictability of our business and helps us preserve the value of our technology by reducing the need to book a given license or licenses at the end of a quarter to generate current quarter revenue however this shift negatively impacted our revenue earnings and cash flow from operations over the last five quarters and as a result revenue and earnings for the fullyear fiscal 2005 were below the levels in fullyear fiscal 2004 

over the long term eda spending growth will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor rd spending and on continued growth in the overall semiconductor market the sia has forecasted modest growth in semiconductor revenues in 2006 and we believe semiconductor rd spending will grow similarly during 2006 however we cannot currently predict whether this outlook will contribute to higher rd spending andor to higher eda spending if eda spending increases we believe we are wellpositioned to capitalize on such increases further recognizing that our customers will continue to spend cautiously and aggressively contain costs we are intensely focused on improving our customers’ overall economics of design by providing more fullyintegrated design solutions and offering customers the opportunity to consolidate their eda spending with us 

we are under no obligation and expressly disclaim any such obligation to update or alter any of the information contained in this overview whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except to the extent required by law 

fiscal 2005 product developments 

during fiscal 2005 we announced or introduced a number of new products and product developments including 

·   general availability of our ic compiler physical design solution which unifies previously separate ic design operations by providing concurrent physical synthesis clocktree synthesis routing yield optimization and signoff correlation and delivering significant improvements in design performance and productivity

·   announcement of our primerail comprehensive solution for timing signal integrity and power network signoff

·   addition of vcs assertion ip library and native test bench support helping engineers find more design bugs faster and achieve up to five times faster verification performance

·   availability of new tcad tools from our acquisition of ise integrated systems engineering ag in november 2004 and our sentaurus tool suite which embeds a comprehensive set of core tcad products for multidimensional process device and system simulation into a powerful user interface

·   availability of enhanced analog and mixedsignal offerings through our acquisition of nassda corporation in may 2005

fiscal 2005 financial performance summary 

·   revenue was 9919 million down 9 from 10921 million in fiscal 2004 primarily reflecting our fourth quarter fiscal 2004 license model shift which significantly reduced upfront license and related maintenance revenue in fiscal 2005

·   timebased license revenue increased 12 from 6632 million in fiscal 2004 to 7437 million in fiscal 2005 primarily reflecting the continued phasein of our license model shift as timebased orders booked in prior periods contribute revenue to current and future periods

·   upfront license revenue declined 72 from 2160 million in fiscal 2004 to 605 million in fiscal 2005 reflecting our modeldriven deemphasis on upfront license bookings

·   we derived approximately 8 of our software license revenue from upfront licenses and 92 from timebased licenses in fiscal 2005 versus approximately 25 and 75 respectively in fiscal 2004 reflecting our license model shift

·   maintenance revenue declined by 20 from 1701 million in fiscal 2004 to 1363 million in fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the shift to a more ratable license model which reduces new maintenance orders since maintenance is included with the license fee in timebased licenses and not reported separately and to a lesser extent by nonrenewal of maintenance by certain existing perpetual license customers

·   professional service and other revenue at 514 million increased 20 from 428 million in fiscal 2004 due to the timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing contracts and continued full utilization of our services capacity

·   net loss was 155 million compared to net income of 743 million in fiscal 2004 primarily due to decreased upfront license revenue resulting from our license model transition increased research and development expenses caused by our fiscal 2005 acquisitions of ise integrated systems engineering ag ise and nassda corporation and increased sales commissions driven by higher shipments and other business performancerelated compensation partially offset by a 33 million litigation settlement gain in connection with the nassda acquisition

·   net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 increased slightly to 2692 million from 2640 million in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of collections on increased bookings the absence of fiscal 2004 payments relating to the termination of the monolithic systems inc acquisition and reduced taxes paid as a result of the net loss for the year partially offset by increased payments relating to our information technology infrastructure

·   we repurchased approximately 51 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 1720 per share for approximately 884 million

fiscal 2005 acquisitions 

during fiscal 2005 we acquired i ise expanding our tcad software offerings ii nassda corporation nassda which broadens our offering of transistorlevel circuit simulation tools particularly in the area of mixedsignal and memory designs and iii certain assets of leda design a developer of mixedsignal intellectual property ip which will help synopsys meet increasing customer demand for ip solutions 

critical accounting policies 

we base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial statements which we prepare in accordance with accounting principles 

generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing these financial statements we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates 

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

·   revenue recognition

·   valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and

·   income taxes

revenue recognition   synopsys recognizes revenue from software licenses and maintenance and service revenue software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of synopsys software maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees

synopsys has designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 

with respect to software licenses synopsys utilizes three license types 

·   technology subscription licenses tsls are for a finite term and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for unspecified future technology we bundle and do not charge separately for postcontract customer support maintenance or pcs for the term of the license

·   term licenses are also for a finite term but do not provide the customer any rights to receive or to exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee

·   perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive or to exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually

for the three software license types we recognize revenue as follows 

·   technology subscription licenses  synopsys typically recognizes revenue from tsl license fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period or if later as customer installments become due and payable all tsls are reported as “timebased licenses”

·   term licenses  synopsys recognizes the term license fee in full if upon shipment of the software payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75 of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met such term licenses are reported as “upfront licenses” for term licenses where less than 75 of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment synopsys recognizes revenue as customer installments become due and payable due and payable term licenses are reported as “timebased licenses”

·   perpetual licenses  synopsys recognizes the perpetual license fee in full if upon shipment of the software payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75 of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met such perpetual 

licenses are reported as upfront licenses for perpetual licenses in which less than 75 of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable such perpetual licenses are reported as timebased licenses 

synopsys allocates revenue on software transactions referred to as “arrangements” involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 

we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to consulting accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop 989 we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and we recognize revenue from consulting services as the related services are performed and accepted 

synopsys makes significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred iii its fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable we apply these criteria as discussed below 

·   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement our customary practice is to have a written contract signed by both the customer and synopsys or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard enduser license arrangement or volume purchase agreement

·   delivery has occurred  we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically for physical deliveries the standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point for electronic deliveries delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or “keys” that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware

·   the fee is fixed or determinable  our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms our standard payment terms require 75 or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year where these terms apply we regard the fee as fixed or determinable and recognize revenue upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met if the payment terms do not meet this standard which we refer to as “extended payment terms” we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable in the case of a tsl we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable due to the fact that maintenance services are included with the software license and due to guidelines relating to arrangements that include rights to receive unspecified future technology

·   collectibility is probable  to recognize revenue we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees which we do on a customerbycustomer basis pursuant to our credit review policy we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection for a new customer or where an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer if we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon its credit review process or the customer’s payment history we recognize revenue on a cashcollected basis

we recognize maintenance and service revenue as follows 

·   maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses  synopsys recognizes revenue from maintenance associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the maintenance term

·   professional service fees  synopsys recognizes revenue from consulting and training services as services are performed and accepted

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill   we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customerinstalled baserelationships trademarks and trade names covenants not to compete customer backlog and other intangibles factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2005 as of october 31 2005 the carrying amount of our intangible assets net was 1425 million

we operate in one operating segment we evaluate aggregate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 in addition we evaluate goodwill for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired we assess the impairment of the goodwill using the twostep method prescribed by sfas 142 any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal 2005 as of october 31 2005 the carrying amount of our goodwill was 7290 million 

income taxes   we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the determination of net deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period

statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in determining future taxable income we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state federal and international pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these 

assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized however should there be a change in our ability to recover all or part of the deferred tax assets an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations if it is ultimately determined that payment of these amounts is unnecessary the liability would be reversed and the tax benefit would be recognized in the period in which it is determined that the liability is no longer necessary if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities an additional charge to expense will result see income tax rate below  and note 8 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of a notice of proposed adjustment from the internal revenue service irs we received in may 2005 asserting a very large net increase to our us taxable income arising from the audit of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 

results of operations 

revenue background 

we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses maintenance and professional services under current accounting rules and policies applicable to different kinds of license arrangements we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and services at varying times in general we recognize revenue on a timebased software license order or tbl over the license term and on an upfront term or perpetual software license order at the time the license is shipped substantially all of our current timebased licenses are technology subscription licenses or tsls with an average license term of approximately three years maintenance orders generally generate revenue ratably over the maintenance period generally one year professional service orders generally generate revenue upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under critical accounting policies  

our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our timebased license upfront license maintenance and professional service revenue for such period we derive timebased license revenue in any quarter almost entirely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters we derive upfront license revenue directly from upfront license orders booked and shipped during the quarter we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year we also derive professional service revenue almost entirely from orders received in prior quarters since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted not when they are booked we derive upfront license revenue directly from upfront license orders booked and shipped during the quarter 

our license revenue is very sensitive to the mix of timebased and upfront licenses delivered during the quarter a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods for example a 120000 order for a threeyear tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter but 10000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters conversely upfront licenses generate higher current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg a 120000 order for an upfront license generates 120000 in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped but no future revenue tsls also result in a shift of maintenance revenue to timebased license revenue since maintenance is included in tsls while maintenance on upfront orders is charged and reported separately 

license order mix 

the percentage of upfront licenses we book is driven by a number of factors including the level of overall license orders customer demand preferred customer payment terms and customerrequested ship dates prior to august 2000 substantially all of our license revenue was upfront beginning in august 2000 when we introduced tsls we shifted our target license order mix to approximately 75 tsls and 25 upfront licenses based on our expectations of total orders and our assessment of the demand for upfront licenses we substantially maintained this mix from this date through fiscal 2003 however as a result of reduced customer demand for upfront licenses as described above in “business environment” we shifted to an almost completely timebased license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 our actual license order mix for the last nine fiscal quarters is set forth below 

 

  

in certain cases our timebased and upfront term license agreements provide the customer the right to “remix” a portion of the software initially licensed for other synopsys specified products the customer’s remix of product when allowed under the license arrangement does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer because in such cases the customer does not need to obtain a new license and pay additional license fees to use the additional products these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately however we believe providing our customers remix rights can also assist in broader adoption of our products 

total revenue 

 

  

the decrease in total revenue for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to our license model shift begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which significantly reduced both upfront license fees and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2005 the decrease in total revenue for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to i a lower level of orders than expected in fiscal 2004 ii our shift in the fourth quarter to an almost completely ratable license model and iii lower maintenance revenue 

timebased license revenue 

 

  

the increase in timebased license revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to our fourth quarter fiscal 2004 license model shift under which previously booked orders continue to contribute to revenue in later periods the increase in timebased revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the continued phasein of our initial august 2000 ratable license model shift and to the fullyear revenue contribution in fiscal 2004 from a strong level of timebased license orders received during fiscal 2003 

upfront license revenue 

 

  

the decrease in upfront license revenue in both percentage and absolute dollar terms for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the fact that we shipped a substantially higherthanaverage percentage of orders as upfront licenses in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2004 and subsequently shifted to a higher ratable license mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the decrease in upfront revenue for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the shift to a higher ratable license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and to lowerthanexpected upfront orders in dollar terms in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 

unfilled upfront license orders were approximately 45 million at october 31 2005 compared to 53 million as of october 31 2004 unfilled upfront license orders represent noncancelable license orders we have received from our customers but have not shipped as of the end of the applicable fiscal period we generally ship our software products promptly after acceptance of customer orders however a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and as a result timing of revenue recognition including the delivery dates requested by customers the effect of the related license revenue on our business plan and our operational capacity to fulfill upfront software license orders at the end of a quarter 

maintenance and service revenue 

 

  

our maintenance revenue has declined due to i our continued shift towards tsls which include maintenance with the license fee and thus generate no separately recognized maintenance revenue ii generally lower maintenance rates on perpetual license transactions above 2 million and iii to a lesser extent nonrenewal of maintenance by certain customers on perpetual or other upfront licenses with our license model shift we expect progressively more of our maintenance revenue to be included in tsl revenue and therefore for our separately recognized maintenance revenue to continue to decline in addition some customers may choose in the future not to renew maintenance on upfront licenses for economic or other factors which would also adversely affect future maintenance revenue 

professional service and other revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and 2003 due to timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing contracts 

events affecting cost of revenues and operating expenses 

temporary shutdown of operations   as a cost saving measure we temporarily shut down operations in north america for three days during the first quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively and four days during the third quarters of fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively resulting in savings of approximately 44 million in fiscal 2005 76 million in fiscal 2004 and 48 million in fiscal 2003 the savings in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 relate primarily to salaries and benefits and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows

 

  

workforce reduction   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we reduced expenses by decreasing the number of employees in most departments in domestic and foreign locations this workforce reduction affected approximately 84 employees in fiscal 2004 50 employees in the us and 34 employees outside the us and 200 employees in fiscal 2003 130 employees in the us and 70 employees outside the us resulting in charges of approximately 66 million in fiscal 2004 and 44 million in fiscal 2003 the charges in each fiscal year relate primarily to severance and other special termination benefits and are included in our consolidated financial statements as follows

 

  

workforce realignment   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we realigned our operations to focus resources on more strategic areas of investment and to become more operationally efficient this realignment affected most departments and resulted in termination of employment of a total of 140 employees in the united states and 100 employees outside the united states charges for severance and other termination benefits totaling 149 million were reflected in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2003 as follows

 

  

certain option expenses   subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we discovered an error in our option grant process related to the documentation of grant dates this error was solely with respect to grants to nonexecutive officer employees the impact of this error on our first through third quarter income statement was approximately 31 million we booked in the fourth quarter 36 million as follows 05 million in cost of goods sold 13 million in research and development expense 09 million in sales and marketing expense and 09 million in general and administrative expense our results of operations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2005 contained in our earnings release dated november 30 2005 did not include this expense as we did not believe at that time the error would result in an adjustment to our operating results with the error corrected we expect we will incur no additional expenses relating to this error

functional allocation of operating expenses 

historically we allocate certain human resource programs information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area annually upon a significant change in headcount as in the case of a workforce reduction realignment or acquisition or as a result of other businessrelated factors management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool we conducted such a review following our workforce realignment in fiscal 2004 the ise acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and the nassda acquisition completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 the resulting expense allocations may contribute significantly to fluctuations in individual operating expenses from period to period 

cost of revenue 

 

  

we divide cost of revenue into three categories i cost of license revenue ii cost of maintenance and service revenue and iii amortization costs in april 2005 we revised our methodology for allocating and reporting cost of revenue externally to better align costs of revenue with the appropriate revenue categories we have reclassified cost of revenue for fiscal 2003 and 2004 to conform to this new allocation methodology in addition we have segregated expenses directly associated with providing consulting and training from costs of revenue associated with internal functions which provide license delivery and postcustomer contract support services management then allocates these consulting and training costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on the proportion of license revenue and maintenance and service revenue reported during the quarter in general our total cost of revenue is relatively fixed and does not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or license mix 

cost of license revenue   cost of license revenue includes costs associated with the sale and licensing of our software products both timebased and upfront cost of license revenue includes the allocated cost 

of employee salary and benefits for providing software delivery including software production costs product packaging amortization of capitalized software development costs related to synopsys products documentation and royalties payable to third party vendors 

cost of maintenance and service revenue   cost of maintenance and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting professionals and associated costs to maintain the related infrastructure necessary to manage a services and training organization further cost of maintenance and service revenue includes allocated costs of employee salary and benefits for providing customer services such as hotline and onsite support production employees and documentation of maintenance updates

amortization costs   amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2003 2004 and 2005 we amortize intangible assets on a straightline basis over their useful lives which range from two to ten years deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with prior and current year acquisitions we amortize the deferred stock compensation over the options’ remaining vesting period of one to four years generally amortization of deferred stock compensation will decrease over time as the assumed stock options vest although employee terminations affect the exact timing and amount of future amortization of deferred stock compensation

the decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to i net reduction of 208 million in amortization expense in coredeveloped technology caused by completion of amortization from fiscal 2002 acquisitions primarily the acquisition of avant corporation and ii the reduction in royalty expense of 13 million primarily resulting from an accrual of 10 million recorded in fiscal 2004 for a potential payment that was determined not required to be paid this decrease was partially offset by an increase of i 140 million in compensation and employee benefits as a result of a our increased investment in professional services personnel and b higher variable compensation associated with our higherthanexpected business performance ii 12 million in compensation due to former ise employees based on achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones and iii 32 million in additional human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 see “ functional allocation of operating expenses ” above total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to lower revenue during 2005 as compared to the revenue in fiscal 2004 and the fact that a large portion of our expenses are fixed 

the increase in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to i an increase in amortization of 97 million of coredeveloped technology recorded as a result of our acquisitions completed in fiscal 2003 and 2004 ii an increase of 91 million in field support personnel costs due to targeted hiring in the customer support function and iii 36 million in additional human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2003 see “ functional allocation of operating expenses ” above this increase was partially offset by a decrease of i 11 million in expenses relating to consulting services ii 26 million in employee expenses as discussed above under workforce realignment  and iii 11 million higher royalty expenses in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to lower revenue during 2004 and increased amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 

operating expenses 

research and development 

 

  

the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to i an increase of 309 million in research and development personnel and related costs primarily as a result of the ise and nassda acquisitions including 53 million in compensation due to former ise employees now employed by synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones and ii an increase of 47 million in human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 as a result of increased headcount this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 27 million in contractor costs as many former contractors in lowercost regions were converted to employees 

research and development expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 remained relatively constant as a result of the following offsetting factors i a 22 million reduction in depreciation expense allocated to this line item as a result of decreased capital spending and lower replacement costs in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 ii severance packages totaling 14 million associated with our workforce reduction during fiscal 2003 which were not incurred during fiscal 2004 iii a 16 million decrease in consulting services in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 iv a 45 million decrease in north america human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to research and development expenses in fiscal 2004 as a result of the decrease in research and development headcount as a percentage of total headcount and v an increase of 101 million in fiscal 2004 research and development personnel and related costs as a result of increased investment in research and development activities 

sales and marketing 

 

  

the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to i an increase of 278 million in variable compensation driven by increased shipments higher commission rates applied to shipments beginning in fiscal 2005 and increased business performancerelated compensation ii an increase of 46 million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs due to increased headcount and acquisitions during the fiscal year and iii an increase of 46 million in severancerelated costs associated with a workforce reduction executed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 these increases were partially offset by decreases of i 42 million as a result of a reduction in expenses for sales conferences and related meetings ii 16 million in human resources information technology and facilities corporate allocated costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 as a result of decreased headcount iii 12 million related to reduced depreciation to this line item as a result of reduced headcount and iv 10 million related to reduced travel expenses 

the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to i a reduction of 40 million in variable compensation driven by reduced orders and shipments in fiscal 2004 ii a reduction of 30 million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs as a result of 

decreased headcount due to previous workforce reductions and realignments and iii 48 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment  this decrease was partially offset by increases of i 44 million in human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing expenses as a result of the increase in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount and ii 12 million related to expanded marketing efforts and charges associated with the cancellation of certain sales employeerelated functions 

general and administrative 

 

  

fiscal 2004 general and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005 primarily due to i the 10 million merger termination fee paid to monolithic system technology inc mosys in april 2004 in connection with termination of an acquisition agreement ii 54 million in professional service fees primarily related to litigation associated with the mosys termination incurred in 2004 iii 17 million in professional services fees incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition of mosys expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 iv a decrease of 32 million in bad debt reserve in fiscal 2005 due to lower than anticipated billings and successful collection efforts v a decrease of 19 million in facilities costs in fiscal 2005 due to closure of certain facilities and vi a decrease of 63 million in human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item in fiscal 2005 lower fiscal 2005 expenses were partially offset by an increase of i 35 million in employee compensation in fiscal 2005 due to increased headcount ii 22 million in depreciation due to increased equipment and assets and iii 27 million in consulting costs primarily related to market and internal business process analyses see “ functional allocation of operating expenses ” above 

the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to i the 100 million termination fee paid to mosys and professional service fees of 71 million relating to that transaction and the subsequent litigation in fiscal 2004 ii an increase of 50 million in professional service fees in fiscal 2004 relating to other litigation matters iii 47 million in facilities costs primarily related to planned facilities consolidation in fiscal 2004 iv a loss of 11 million related to the sublease of a portion of our ireland headquarters facility in fiscal 2004 and v a 35 million increase in depreciation due to increased capital spending in information technology these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 35 million in human resources information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item see “ functional allocation of operating expenses ” above 

inprocess research and development 

inprocess research and development iprd is comprised of inprocess technologies of i 57 million associated with the acquisition of ise in fiscal 2005 ii 16 million associated with an acquisition in fiscal 2004 considered immaterial for financial statement purposes iii 183 million associated with our acquisition of numerical technologies inc numerical described below and iv 16 million associated with an acquisition considered immaterial for financial statement purposes in fiscal 2003 at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses accordingly these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

valuation of iprd   the value assigned to acquired inprocess technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date the value of inprocess technology is then divided into two classifications i developed technology completed and ii inprocess technology tobecompleted giving explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and to be created by synopsys after the acquisition these value creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors i timebased data ii costbased data and iii complexitybased data

the value of the inprocess technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the income producing capabilities of the inprocess technologies under this approach the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified products within the classification divisions revenue estimates were based on i individual product revenues ii anticipated growth rates iii anticipated product development and introduction schedules iv product sales cycles and v the estimated life of a product’s underlying technology from the revenue estimates operating expense estimates including costs of sales general and administrative sales and marketing income taxes and a use charge for contributory assets were deducted to arrive at operating income we estimated revenue growth rates for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors expected industry trends the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product’s underlying technology operating expense estimates reflect synopsys’ historical expense ratios additionally these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition 

the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology is our weightedaverage cost of capital taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at this time 

ise   on november 2 2004 we acquired ise a worldleading provider of tcad technology computeraided design software and related services the iprd expense related to the ise acquisition was 57 million ise had one iprd project—floops a next generation process simulator we incurred a minimal amount in iprd related to this project which led to the introduction of our sentaurus product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 this project is considered to be complete except for ongoing maintenance future product enhancements and new features related to this core product expenditures to complete ise’s acquired inprocess technologies approximated the original estimates

numerical   on march 1 2003 we acquired numerical which specialized in subwavelength lithographyenabling solutions the iprd expense related to the numerical acquisition was 183 million numerical had five iprd projects—phase shift masking psm subwavelength software equipment software cadabra and computer aided transcription system cats—representing 25 7 6 5 and 57 respectively of the total iprd value these projects were expected to be completed shortly following the merger psm subwavelength software and cats software were completed in fiscal 2003 our cadabra ® product was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 the equipment software project consists of inprocess technology for multiple products these products were either completed in fiscal 2003 discontinued or were integrated with other synopsys products during fiscal 2004 expenditures to complete numerical’s acquired inprocess technologies approximated the original estimates

amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation   amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts coredeveloped technology trademarks trade names customer relationships covenants not to compete and other intangibles acquired in business combinations completed during fiscal 2003 2004 and 2005 we amortize intangible assets on a straightline basis over their useful lives which range from three to ten years deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with prior year acquisitions we amortize deferred stock compensation on a straightline basis over the options’ remaining vesting period of one to four years generally amortization of deferred stock compensation will decrease over time as the assumed stock options vest although employee terminations affect the exact timing and amount of future amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization expense for these assets is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows

 

  

the decrease in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is driven by completion of the amortization of the intangible assets related to coredeveloped technology from fiscal 2002 acquisitions primarily the acquisition of avant and by the declining amounts of amortization related to deferred compensation recorded in prior year acquisitions partially offset by amortization charges from the ise and nassda acquisitions 

the increase in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to additional amortization of assets acquired in the numerical acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 partially offset by the declining amounts of amortization related to deferred compensation recorded in prior year acquisitions 

see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts 

impairment of intangible assets   there were no material impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003

expensing of stock awards   in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 sfas 123r will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans synopsys currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stockbased awards to its employees under this standard we generally have not recognized any compensation expense related to stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans or related to the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans under the new rules we will be required to adopt a fairvaluebased method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and therefore will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations note 2 to our consolidated financial statements provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fairvaluebased method similar to the methods required under sfas 123r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003

other income expense net 

 

  

in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 we reevaluated our interpretation of certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 133 as amended accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas 133 resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of our hedging program to correct the error we reclassified the remaining 30 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the year ended october 31 2005 

the increase in other income expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to i the 33 million gain from the litigation settlement relating to the nassda acquisition and ii the reclassification of 30 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income this increase is primarily offset by 45 million writedown of certain investments 

see notes 3 and 9 to consolidated financial statements 

the decrease in other income expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to reduced investment gains and reduced rental income 

income tax rate 

income taxes   the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as of october 31 2005 current deferred tax assets net of current deferred tax liabilities totaled 1955 million noncurrent deferred tax assets net of noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled 824 million we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would charge to income an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination

we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the us as of october 31 2005 there was no cumulative amount of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 

irs revenue agent’s report   on may 31 2005 we received a notice of proposed adjustment from the internal revenue service irs asserting a very large net increase to our us taxable income arising 

from the audit of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 on june 8 2005 we received a revenue agent’s report rar in which the irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately 4768 million plus interest interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate which adjusts quarterly a higher underpayment rate of interest may be charged as a result of the issuance of the rar 

this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a whollyowned foreign subsidiary the proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total amount relating to these transactions asserted under the irs theories on july 13 2005 we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs which will cause the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs resolution of this matter could take a considerable time possibly years 

we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals accordingly we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously while we believe the irs’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law we believe it is probable that we will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter however based on our analysis to date we believe we have adequately provided for this matter if we are required to pay a significant amount of additional us taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for this matter our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

repatriation of foreign earnings   the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act provides for a special onetime elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to 85 of the eligible distribution during the fourth quarter of 2005 we repatriated 360 million of which 1725 million qualified for the special onetime elective dividends received deduction and 1875 million constituted earnings that do not qualify under the act previously taxed income and return of capital we recorded tax expense of 112 million related to the repatriation of 360 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 our chief executive officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan drip to invest up to 185 million in foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the act as required by the act the reinvestment plan was ratified by the board of directors in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we satisfied the drip reinvestment requirements during fiscal 2005

tax reserves   we may establish reserves for tax contingencies based on the probable outcome of tax positions taken for financial statement purposes compared to positions taken on the tax returns in fiscal 2005 we released tax contingency reserves totaling 340 million related to previously acquired companies as a result of expiration of the applicable statute of limitation these released liabilities were recorded against acquisition goodwill with no effect on our net loss in fiscal 2005 we continuously review our tax contingency reserves to ensure that they are appropriately stated such review includes consideration of tax controversy factors such as periods covered by the cause of action the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome our ability to estimate the liability the timing of the liability and how it will impact our other tax attributes at october 31 2005 we believe that we have adequately provided for our taxrelated liabilities

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 

as of october 31 2005 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 5865 million compared to 5790 million as of october 31 2004 

cash provided by operations is in part dependent upon the payment terms on our license agreements payment terms for timebased licenses are generally extended with the license fee typically paid quarterly 

in even increments over the term of the license conversely for an upfront license customers pay a substantial portion of the license fee within the first year accordingly we generally receive cash from timebased licenses the primary component of our business under our almost fully ratable license model later than from upfront licenses 

cash provided by operations was 2692 million for the year ended october 31 2005 compared to 2640 million for the same period in fiscal 2004 this increase largely resulted from i an increase in deferred revenue of 628 million due to the change in our licenses from upfront to timebased licenses during the last quarter of fiscal 2004 ii the payment of 154 million for the mosys acquisition agreement termination fee and associated litigation made in fiscal 2004 but not in 2005 and iii lower disbursements for income taxes and value added taxes paid of approximately 249 million and 75 million respectively this increase was offset by i increased disbursements of 233 million associated with prepaid maintenance contracts for our information technology infrastructure as compared to the prior fiscal year and ii 492 million reduction in cash used to satisfy accounts payable in fiscal 2005 

accounts receivable net of allowances decreased 320 million or 24 to 1002 million as of october 31 2005 from 1323 million as of october 31 2004 days sales outstanding dso calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date decreased to 36 days as of october 31 2005 from 53 days as of october 31 2004 the decrease in dso and accounts receivable is attributable to lower billings for the fiscal year due to greater concentration of tsls in our more ratable license model since cash is collected over a longer period of time for tsls than upfront licenses 

cash provided by operations was 2640 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 3915 million in fiscal 2003 the decrease in cash from operations was driven in part by lower orders and reported revenues in fiscal 2004 as well as by increased use of operating cash as follows i cash disbursements for foreign income taxes of approximately 447 million ii payment of 154 million for the mosys acquisition agreement termination fee and associated litigation costs iii disbursements associated with our fiscal 2003 workforce realignment of approximately 149 million iv payments of international value added taxes of approximately 75 million and v increased prepaid maintenance contract expenses for our design and information systems electronic infrastructure these uses of cash were partially offset by income tax refunds of 286 million 

accounts receivable net of allowances decreased 687 million or 34 to 1323 million as of october 31 2004 from 2010 million as of october 31 2003 days sales outstanding dso calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date decreased to 53 days as of october 31 2004 from 58 days as of october 31 2003 the decrease in accounts receivable and dso was attributable to a 1007 million reduction in new billings caused by lower orders during fiscal 2004 and longer customer payment terms compared to fiscal 2003 partially offset by a 390 million decrease in collections compared to the prior fiscal year 

cash used in investing activities was 1715 million for the year ended october 31 2005 compared to 1720 million for the same period in fiscal 2004 cash used in investing activities remained relatively constant as we offset the increase of 1144 million of cash used in acquisitions by a corresponding reduction in cash used in net purchases of short term and long term investments 

cash used in investing activities was 1720 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 2583 million in fiscal 2003 the decrease of 863 million is primarily due to a substantial decrease of cash used for acquisitions and decreased proceeds from the sale of longterm investments 

cash used in financing activities was 398 million for the year ended october 31 2005 compared to 2666 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004 the decrease of 2268 million in cash used was due to a decrease of 3349 million in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open 

market compared to the year ended october 31 2004 and decreased proceeds of 1081 million from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock plans compared to fiscal 2004 

cash used in financing activities was 2666 million in fiscal 2004 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 742 million in fiscal 2003 the decrease of 3408 million is primarily due to a decrease in proceeds of 1782 million from the sale of shares pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans during fiscal 2004 and increased purchases of our common stock in the open market of 1626 million during fiscal 2004 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act provides for a special onetime elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to 85 of the eligible distribution during the fourth quarter of 2005 we repatriated 360 million of which 1725 million qualified for the special onetime elective dividends received deduction and 1875 million constituted earnings that do not qualify under the act previously taxed income and return of capital we recorded tax expense of 112 million related to the repatriation of 360 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 our chief executive officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan drip to invest up to 185 million in foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the act as required by the act the reinvestment plan was ratified by the board of directors in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we satisfied the drip reinvestment requirements during fiscal 2005 

we hold our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and in foreign accounts primarily in ireland bermuda and japan as of october 31 2005 we held an aggregate of 4868 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the united states and an aggregate of 997 million in foreign accounts funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america with the exception of japan and the repatriated funds described above we currently maintain a policy under apb 23 accounting for income taxes—special areas  of permanently reinvesting such funds outside of the united states 

in april 2004 we entered into a threeyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility this facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants the facility terminates on april 28 2007 borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 however we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 080 and 1125 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant in addition commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 020 and 025 per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant in april 2004 we borrowed and repaid 200 million under the credit facility on may 3 2005 we borrowed 750 million under this credit facility in connection with the acquisition of nassda we repaid this amount in full as of may 27 2005 as of october 31 2005 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants 

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 31 2005 

 

1   this commitment relates to the fees associated with the revolving credit facility additional information is provided in note 5 of our consolidated financial statements 

2   additional information is provided in note 6 of our consolidated financial statements 

3   purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october 31 2005 although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services

4   includes a approximately 49 million in promissory notes payable in september 2007 issued in connection with an acquisition in september 2002 and b a bond payable in september 2023 to the city of san jose for participating in a development project for land owned by us additional information is provided in note 5 of our consolidated financial statements  certain longterm liabilities reflected on our balance sheet such as unearned revenue are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future

we are committed to making an additional payment of 21 million related to the bond payable in note 4 above in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to october 31 2005 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 113 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 156 million in cash during the two years following the next 12 months if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved in full because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals being achieved in full these amounts are not reflected in the table above we closed our acquisition of hpl technologies inc hpl on december 7 2005 and are committed to make cash expenditures in fiscal 2006 see note 14 of our consolidated financial statements  these amounts are not reflected in the table above 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly

factors that may affect future results 

our reported results of operations will be materially and adversely affected by our adoption of sfas 123r 

statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r which will be effective in our first quarter of fiscal 2006will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stockbased awards to our employees under this standard we generally have not recognized any compensation expense related to stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans or the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans under the new rules we will be required to adopt a fair valuebased method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations note 2 to consolidated financial statements in this report provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair valuebased method similar to the methods required under sfas 123r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during the periods presented 

weakness budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our business 

we believe that eda industry growth has been adversely affected by many factors including ongoing efforts by semiconductor companies to control their spending uncertainty regarding the long term growth rate of the semiconductor industry excess eda tool capacity at many customers and increased competition in the eda industry itself if these factors persist or semiconductor industry growth does not occur or if we do not benefit from any such increases our business operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 

we also believe that over the long term growth in eda spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor rd spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market however we 

cannot predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues rd spending or spending on eda products nor whether we will benefit from any such increases should they occur for example although the semiconductor industry grew by 18 in 2003 and 29 in 2004 and we estimate that rd spending among large semiconductor companies increased approximately 10 from 2003 to 2004 eda industry revenue during this period did not track these growth levels 

competition in the eda industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we compete with other eda vendors that offer a broad range of products and services primarily cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation and with eda vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process such as magma design automation inc we also compete with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities if we fail to compete effectively our business will be materially and adversely affected 

we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features including easeofuse timetoresults postsale support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms additional competitive challenges include the following 

·   customers require a mix of price and tool performance that suits their needs in some cases this may lead them to choose vendors based on price more than performance in certain situations we may offer substantial discounts on our products to meet pricing set by the competition if as we expect customers begin to consolidate their purchases with fewer vendors some eda suppliers may pursue a deep discount strategy as a result prices for our products may decline andor we may lose potential business to lower price competitors in either case our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

·   technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly accordingly we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments innovate rapidly and efficiently improve our existing products and successfully develop or acquire new products if we fail to do so our business will be materially and adversely affected

·   to compete effectively we believe we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance doing both requires significant engineering and development work we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue offering complete design flows in configurations our customers will find more attractive than our competitors’ offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance will be successful

·   our major initiatives face intense competition and in some cases address emerging markets we have invested significant resources into further development of our galaxy design platform integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of its system verilog and other advanced features and development of our design for manufacturing and ip portfolios and have acquired companies that focus on these areas it is difficult for us to predict the success of these initiatives and acquisitions if we fail to expand revenue from our new initiatives at the desired rate our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected

·   payment terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated by our customers during the second half of fiscal 2003 and continuing through 2004 and 2005 payment terms on timebased licenses lengthened compared to prior periods negatively affecting our cash flow from operations

the decline in new ic design starts industry consolidation and other potentially longterm trends may adversely affect the eda industry including demand for our products and services 

the increasing complexity of socs and ics and customers’ concerns about managing cost and risk have also led to the following potentially longterm negative trends 

·   the number of starts of new ic designs has declined since 2000 new ic design starts are a key driver of demand for eda software

·   a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including synopsys

·   due to factors such as increased globalization cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent adversely impacting our customers’ eda spending

·   industry changes plus the cost and complexity of ic design may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design or using field programmable gate arrays fpgas an alternative chip technology

these trends if sustained could have a material adverse effect on the eda industry including the demand for our products and services which in turn would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we have received a revenue agent’s report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our us taxable income an adverse outcome of this examination or any future examinations involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions and to review or audit by irs and state local and foreign tax authorities in connection with an irs audit of our united states federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 on may 31 2005 we received a notice of proposed adjustment in which the irs claimed a very large increase to our us taxable income on june 8 2005 we received a revenue agent’s report in which the irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately 4768 million plus interest this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a whollyowned foreign subsidiary we have filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs which will cause the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs resolution of this matter could take a considerable time possibly years 

we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals accordingly we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously while we believe the irs’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law we believe it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter however based on our analysis to date we believe we have adequately provided for this matter if we are required to pay a significant amount of additional us taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for this matter our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

the failure to meet the semiconductor industry’s demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may adversely affect our financial result s

soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing to address greater complexity semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers at the same time as a result of pricing pressure on their own products we believe customers and potential customers are also seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs failure to manage these conflicting demands successfully would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our revenue and earnings fluctuate which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline 

m any factors affect our revenue and earnings including customer demand license mix the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold and committed expense levels making it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period accordingly stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance if our financial results or targets do not meet investor and analyst expectations our stock price could decline 

some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include but are not limited to 

·   we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income

·   beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we shifted our target license mix to consist almost entirely of timebased licenses timebased licenses yield significantly less current period revenue and more future period revenue than upfront licenses the license mix shift decreased revenue and earnings for fiscal 2005

·   our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and timebased licenses the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders customer demand preferred customer payment terms and requested customer ship dates could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings for example if we ship more upfront licenses than expected during any given fiscal period our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target conversely if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target similarly if we receive a lowerthanexpected level of tbl orders during a given period our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected

·   we may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externallycommunicated financial targets any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could adversely affect our business

·   the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers’ products customer rd and eda tool budgets pricing our competitors’ product offerings and customer design starts it is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customer’s demand for our products on a medium or long term basis as a result actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts 

which in turn could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publiclydisclosed targets 

·   certain of our upfront and timebased license agreements provide the right to remix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other synopsys products for example a customer may use our frontend design products for a portion of the term of its license and then remix such products for backend placement software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s ic design while this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately

·   in the past we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter the delay of one or more orders particularly an upfront order could have a material adverse effect on our bookings revenue and earnings for that quarter

·   our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products either alone or against competing products before making a purchase decision accordingly our customers’ evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters further sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approval or project starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles

businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project 

we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years including four in fiscal 2005 six transactions during fiscal 2004 and three transactions in fiscal 2003 and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to acquire additional companies in the future 

in addition to direct costs acquisitions pose a number of risks including 

·   potential dilution of our earnings per share

·   problems in integrating the acquired products with our products

·   difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company

·   challenges in ensuring acquired products meet our quality standards

·   failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings

·   failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales

·   drain on management time for acquisitionrelated activities

·   delays caused by regulatory scrutiny

·   adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships and

·   assumption of unknown liabilities

while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will positively affect our future performance furthermore if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology we could be required to write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with such product or technology these writedowns if significant could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to timely recruit and retain key employees would have a material adverse effect on our business 

to be successful we must attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and 

ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers any failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial employees would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we issue stock options and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation there is growing pressure on public companies from stockholders who must approve any increases in our stock option pool generally to reduce our overhang or amount of outstanding and unexercised stock options in addition the implementation of new accounting rules that require us to recognize on our income statement compensation expense from employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2006 which we expect will increase pressure to limit future option grants these factors may make it more difficult for synopsys to grant attractive equitybased packages in the future which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees 

stagnation of foreign economies foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance 

during fiscal 2005 and 2004 we derived 49 and 45 respectively of our revenue from outside the united states going forward we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from outside the united states foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic political and health conditions including the effects of international political conflict hostilities and natural disasters further any stagnation of foreign economies could adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states 

our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations can be adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies including the euro the japanese yen and the canadian dollar as a result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business results of operations and financial condition while we hedge certain foreign currency exposures of our business we can provide no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective 

in addition we have expanded our nonus operations significantly in the past several years while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions locally and higher international sales this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states the failure to effectively manage our global operations would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

customer payment defaults could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our backlog consists principally of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered these customer obligations are typically not cancelable but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults and fails to pay amounts owed in these cases we will generally take legal action to recover amounts owed moreover existing customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses though we have not to date experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

a failure to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology to protect this technology we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide we can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors moreover certain foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited we have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies however there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in addition intellectual property litigation is lengthy and expensive and legal fees related to such litigation may reduce our net income 

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 

under our customer agreements and other license agreements we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights for example we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense 

these types of claims can however result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to changes in financial accounting standards which may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business 

accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations significantly affecting the way we license our products future changes in financial accounting standards including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition may have a significant effect on our reported results including reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of the changes 

our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

because our common stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq stock market we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulated organizations including the sec nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board which monitors the accounting practices of public companies many of these regulations have only recently been enacted and continue to evolve making compliance more difficult and uncertain in addition our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities 

in particular section 404 of sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and auditor attestation of that assessment in our annual reports this effort has required and will continue to require in the future the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources this annual report on form 10k discloses a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting although we believe that our ongoing review of our internal controls will enable us to provide favorable assessments of our internal controls and for our external auditors to provide their annual attestations in future sec filings as required by section 404 we can give no assurance that these efforts will be completed on a timely and successful basis any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain our auditors’ attestation could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products in addition allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could even if untrue adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to license ip products from us any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of our investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument

the following table presents the carrying value and related weightedaverage total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31 2005 

 

  

as of october 31 2005 the stated maturities of our current shortterm investments are 416 million within one year 208 million within one to five years 108 million within five to ten years and 1089 million after ten years however we consider these investments to be shortterm in nature because in accordance with our investment policy the weightedaverage expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for shortterm obligations and other uses including acquisitions these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax 

the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2005 that are subject to interest rate risk by calendar year of expected duration and average interest rates 

 

  

in comparison the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31 2004 that were subject to interest rate risk by calendar year of expected duration and average interest rates 

 

  

in april 2004 synopsys entered into a threeyear 2500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility this facility contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash as well as other nonfinancial covenants the facility terminates on april 28 2007 borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 050 however we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 080 and 1125 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant in addition commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 020 and 025 per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant in april 2004 and may 2005 we borrowed and repaid 2000 and 750 million respectively under the credit facility as of october 31 2005 and 2004 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants 

foreign currency risk   the functional currency of each of synopsys’ active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for our principal irish and swiss subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the us dollar we engage in a program to minimize the effect of changes in the exchange rate between a given functional currency ie the yen in the case of our japanese subsidiary and the corresponding nonfunctional currency transactions ie receivables denominated in the us dollar in the case of our japanese subsidiary we hedge the following types of nonfunctionalcurrencydenominated balances and transactions i certain assets and liabilities ii shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month iii future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders and iv certain future intercompany invoices denominated in the euro a description of the accounting under our hedging programs is included in note 2 to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2005 

 

  

the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2004 

 

  

the amounts shown in the tables include the balances and transactions described above the maximum original duration of the currency contracts shown is 16 months in the case of our euro forward contracts and one month in the case of contracts for other currencies due to the short  term nature of these contracts the contract rates approximate fair value as of october 31 2005 and 2004 

the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies to the extent our estimates are correct gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 

for example if the euro were to depreciate by 10 prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table above the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 60 million and we would be required to pay approximately 60 million to the counterparty upon contract 

maturity at the same time the us dollar value of our eurobased expenses would decline resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately 60 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

net unrealized loss of approximately 06 million and gain of 96 million net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet as of october 31 2005 and october 31 2004 respectively net cash outflows on maturing forward contracts during the three months ended october 31 2005 were 29 million 

if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 synopsys reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of sfas 133 resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of synopsys’ hedging program to correct the error synopsys reclassified the remaining 30 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income in the three months ended january 31 2005 

foreign currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we have limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk furthermore we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes 

equity risk   our strategic investment portfolio as of october 31 2005 consists of approximately 80 million of minority equity investments in publicly traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately 128 million as of october 31 2004 the securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as availableforsale securities accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value during fiscal 2005 and 2004 we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by 45 million and 35 million respectively

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 in making 

this assessment our management used the framework established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 related to our accounting for income taxes specifically our processes and procedures did not include adequate management oversight and review of our income tax accounting practices as a result of the aforementioned material weakness certain of our income tax accounting calculations and reserves contained errors which were in aggregate material specifically i we did not appropriately consider the impact of existing tax reserves on the calculation of tax expense related to our repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 thus overstating income tax expense and the related tax liability and ii upon expiration of the federal statute of limitations we did not reduce an existing tax reserve established upon consummation of a 2002 business combination thus overstating tax reserves and goodwill as of october 31 2005 these errors were corrected prior to the issuance of our 2005 consolidated financial statements

because of the material weakness described above management has concluded synopsys did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the coso 

kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an auditors’ report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 which report appears below 

b changes in internal controls   there were no changes in synopsys internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended october 31 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect synopsys internal control over financial reporting 

we are taking the following actions to remediate the material weakness described above i implementing additional recurring review procedures to help ensure compliance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  and other applicable rules and regulations with respect to tax matters ii establishing additional procedures to help identify and address tax accounting issues in a more timely and comprehensive manner and iii reorganizing and augmenting our tax department to improve communication actions i and ii will be in place in connection with the preparation of our first quarter financial statements and action iii is being implemented and will be completed as soon as practicable

the board of directors and stockholders synopsys inc 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting item 9aa that synopsys inc the “company” did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 because of the effect of a material weakness identified in management’s assessment based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected the company identified a material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 related to the company’s accounting for income taxes specifically the company’s processes and procedures did not include adequate management oversight and review of the company’s income tax accounting practices as a result of the aforementioned material weakness certain of the company’s income tax accounting calculations and reserves contained errors which were in aggregate material specifically i the company did not appropriately consider the impact of existing tax reserves on the calculation of tax expense related to the company’s repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 thus overstating income tax expense and the related tax liability and ii upon expiration of the federal statute of limitations the company did not 

reduce an existing tax reserve established upon consummation of a 2002 business combination thus overstating tax reserves and goodwill as of october 31 2005 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of synopsys inc and subsidiaries as of october 31 2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended october 31 2005 the aforementioned material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal 2005 consolidated financial statements and this report does not affect our report dated january 12 2006 which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements 

in our opinion management’s assessment that synopsys inc did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso also in our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria synopsys inc has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso

the role of eda in the electronics industry 

  

continuing technology advances in the semiconductor industry have dramatically increased the feature density speed power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors also referred to as integrated circuits ics or chips 

  

   

   

   

   

combined these advances in semiconductor technology have driven development of lower cost higher performance computers wireless communications networks cell phones handheld personal devices internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices each advance however has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production including designers manufacturers equipment manufacturers and eda software suppliers 

  

the ic design process 

  

eda software is central to the ic design process as it enables designers to 

  

   

   

   

in simplified form ic design consists of system design logic design functional verification physical design and physical verification 

  

system design in system design the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized highlevel computer language typically verilog or vhdl this phase yields a relatively highlevel “register transfer level” rtl description of the chip system design is an early stage market segment for eda companies as most eda products have focused to date on logic design functional verification and physical design and verification 

  

logic design logic design or “synthesis” programs convert the rtl code into a logical diagram of the chip and produce a data file known as a “net list” describing the various groups of transistors or “gates” to be built on the chip related programs insert into the design the additional circuitry that will be needed to test the chip after manufacture 

  

in a growing number of designs logic synthesis is performed together with a portion of physical design this combined process known as “physical synthesis” produces a data file describing the chip plus a portion of the chip’s physical layout also in a growing number of socs designers are increasingly performing “design planning” in which the designer determines the location of the major functional “blocks” on the soc prior to logic synthesis 

  

functional verification before and after logic design the designer uses testbench automation and other verification tools to simulate large sets of inputs that a given ic design might confront in reallife operation by running these extensive tests the designer can verify that the design will function as intended 

  

physical design in the physical design stage the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with a “place and route” tool the designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip as well as the location for each transistor within each block a process known as “placement” then the designer adds the connections between the transistors a process known as “routing” the output of place and route programs is one or more data files that can be read by physical verification programs as described below or by the equipment used to manufacture the chip 

  

physical verification before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication the designer must perform a series of further verification steps confirming again that the chip will still operate at the desired speed and checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip the designer may need to add features to the design to ensure that the chip can be manufactured successfully the completion of this final phase is called “tapeout” 

  

in actual chip design each of these steps has a number of additional elements and designers often undertake the various design and verification steps in a different order than described above and repeat one or more steps multiple times further several of the steps especially logic design and physical design are becoming more integrated with each other if at any stage of the process the designer determines the chip design will not perform as intended the designer must go back one or more steps and correct the problem then continue through subsequent steps recreating a chip’s logic design devising and performing simulation over again and other iterations all take time each such iteration adds significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet timetomarket goals 

  

current issues facing ic designers 

  

as chip technology continues to advance our customers face three principal types of interrelated challenges 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

synopsys overview 

  

we provide products and services that help our customers meet the challenges of designing leadingedge ics as a result of our mid2002 acquisition of avant corporation avant we now offer a comprehensive suite of system design logic design functional verification physical design and physical verification products our march 2003 acquisition of numerical technologies inc numerical expanded our offerings of manufacturing technologies and products geared towards small geometry designs we also sell the broadest array of preverified intellectual property ip components of any company in the eda industry finally we offer a full range of professional services including turnkey design services design assistance and methodology consulting 

  

we market our products worldwide and offer comprehensive customer service education consulting and support as integral components of our product offerings we market our products primarily through our direct sales force we have licensed our products to most of the world’s leading semiconductor computer communications electronics and device companies 

  

strategy 

  

our strategy has three principal components first we have historically focused and will continue to focus on providing our customers the most technologically advanced products to address each step in the ic design process second building on the strength of our individual products we will continue to focus on developing broad increasingly integrated “platforms” or collections of key individual products that are tightly integrated through the use of common technologies to deliver enhanced value in fiscal 2003 we created two distinct platforms our galaxy design platform and our discovery verification platform third we will expand our product offerings in areas offering the potential for rapid growth for example we have undertaken initiatives in both the intellectual property and design for manufacturing segments as described below under products and services  

  

organization 

  

we operate in a single segment and are currently organized into four primary groups implementation verification solutions and new ventures 

  

   

   

   

   

our other groups include worldwide sales worldwide application services finance human resources and facilities and chief technology office 

  

products and services 

  

our products and services focus on the principal needs of semiconductor designers and at a business level are divided into the four groups specified above we provide financial information regarding our products and services under part ii item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — revenue — product groups  

  

implementation group 

  

galaxy design platform  in february 2003 we announced the combination of many of our leading ic design products into a single unified platform called the galaxy ™ design platform galaxy includes the following products 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

with the galaxy design platform our goal is to provide our customers a single integrated ic design platform based on leading individual products which incorporates common libraries and consistent timing delay calculation and constraints throughout the design process using our open milkyway database and yet allows designers the flexibility to integrate internally developed and thirdparty tools with this advanced functionality 

  

common foundation and flexibility our galaxy design platform should help reduce design times decrease integration costs and minimize the risks inherent in advanced complex ic designs 

  

verification group 

  

discovery verification platform  also during fiscal 2003 we introduced our discovery ™ verification platform the discovery platform combines many of our verification and nanometer level analysis tools in a unified environment to provide high performance and efficient interaction among these technologies the discovery verification platform includes the following products 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the discovery verification platform also includes our discovery ams platform a subset of the above technologies tuned to perform verification on analog and mixed analoganddigital designs and supports the latest accellera systemverilog language standard verilog vhdl mixedhdl systemc and for analog mixedsignal based methodologies verilogams and spice 

  

the increasing size and complexity of today’s ics and socs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs with test creation and verification now consuming up to 70 of the total design time for a given ic our discovery platform combines our simulation and verification products and designforverification methodologies and provides a consistent control environment to significantly improve the speed breadth and accuracy of our customers’ verification efforts on complex chip designs increasing their productivity and helping them deliver their products to market faster 

  

solutions 

  

synopsys’ solutions group includes our portfolio of ip products and components and our consulting services group 

  

intellectual property products  as ic designs continue to grow in size reusing proven design blocks is an increasingly important way to reduce overall design cost and cycle time enabling reuse of ip requires a significant methodology shift from traditional ic design in the past designs were intimately tied to a particular semiconductor process technology or design methodology making reuse of design blocks from one chip design to the next both difficult and costly more recently ic companies have been able to increasingly reuse predesigned and verified ip components particularly those that implement basic or standardized functions the ability to reuse such ip allows ic companies to focus their design teams on designing the chip features that will give its products a competitive advantage using predesigned ip can also reduce a chip designer’s verification risk by ensuring that the “designed in” portions of the chip are “preverified” and thus high quality because of the increasing importance of predesigned ip and in order to minimize the risk and effort in acquiring ip from a myriad of smaller suppliers ic designers are beginning to consolidate their ip purchases from fewer vendors who can provide a reliable comprehensive portfolio of proven ip 

  

our ip products include 

  

   

   

   

finally synopsys’ star ip program permits designware library users to gain access to popular microprocessor cores from leading semiconductor and ip companies we have worked with these companies to improve the reusability of these microprocessor cores as well as to integrate them with other designware microprocessor subsystems the program includes cores from companies like mips nec and infineon and in 2003 we added a powerpc microprocessor from ibm 

  

professional services  we provide a comprehensive portfolio of consulting services covering all critical phases of the soc development process as well as systems development in wireless and broadband applications we offer customers a variety of engagement models ranging from project assistance which helps our customers design verify andor test their chips and improve their design processes to full turnkey development 

  

new ventures 

  

our new ventures group includes a number of products and initiatives relating to analogmixed signal ic design and verification and design for manufacturing 

  

analog mixedsignal tools  our cosmos ™ tool is used to create analog designs cosmos uses schematicdriven layout to place and route fullcustom ics the new ventures group also manages development and marketing of our nanosim and hspice tools described above under discovery verification platform  

  

design for manufacturing  with the acquisitions of avant and numerical we offer a variety of products and technologies used at the intersection of ic design and manufacturing which address a variety of issues principally those encountered using photolithography techniques to manufacture ics when advanced ics have feature dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light used to expose those dimensions during production we address these markets through our design for manufacturing initiatives which include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

customer service and technical support 

  

we believe a high level of customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products we provide technical support for our products through both field and corporatebased application engineering groups customers who purchase technology subscription licenses tsls receive software maintenance services also known as “post contract support” pcs bundled with their license fee customers who purchase term licenses and perpetual licenses may purchase these services separately see product sales and licensing agreements below 

  

software maintenance services include minor product enhancements we develop bug fixes and access to our technical support center for primary support software maintenance also includes access via electronic mail and the world wide web to solvnet ®  our webbased support solution that lets customers quickly seek answers to design questions or more insight into design problems solvnet gives customers access to synopsys’ complete design knowledge database using sophisticated information retrieval technology updated daily it includes documentation design tips and answers to user questions customers can also engage our application consultants our worldwide network of product experts for additional support needs 

  

customer education services 

  

we offer training workshops designed to increase customer design productivity while using our products workshops cover synopsys tools and methodology used in our design and verification tool flows as well as specialized modules addressing system design logic design physical design simulation and test we offer regularly scheduled workshops in mountain view california austin texas marlboro massachusetts reading england rungis france munich germany tokyo and osaka japan seoul korea and other locations we also schedule onsite workshops worldwide at our customers’ facilities or other locations approximately 8500 engineers attended synopsys workshops during fiscal 2003 

  

product warranties 

  

we generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days we also typically provide our customers limited indemnities with respect to claims that their use of our design and verification software products infringe on united states patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets we have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date 

  

support for industry standards 

  

we actively create and support standards we believe will help our customers increase productivity improve interoperability of tools from different vendors and solve design problems standards in the eda industry can be established by formal accredited committees by licensing made available to all or through open source licensing 

  

synopsys’ products support many formal standards including the most commonly used hardware description languages vhdl verilog hdl systemverilog and systemc as well as numerous industry standard data formats for the exchange of data between our tools other eda vendor’s products and applications customers develop internally 

  

synopsys is a board member andor participant in the following major eda standards organizations accellera a notforprofit formal standards organization that drives languagebased standards for systems semiconductor and design tool companies the interoperability committee of the eda consortium which helps promote quality and interoperability among eda products from different vendors the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee a nonprofit technical professional association and a leading developer of global industry standards the virtual socket interface alliance vsia an industry group formed to promote standards that facilitate the integration and reuse of functional blocks of intellectual property and the open systemc initiative osci a nonprofit organization that manages systemc a language developed by synopsys and donated to osci with representation from the systems semiconductor ip embedded software and eda industries 

  

synopsys’ tapin program provides interface standards to all companies through an open source licensing model synopsys manages changes and enhancements that come from the community of licensees synopsys other eda companies and eda customers use these standards to facilitate interoperability of their tools the standards offered through tapin include liberty for library modeling sdc for design constraints saif for switching activity and openvera for hardware verification synopsys’ common database milkyway is available for tool integration by eda vendors through our mapin program 

  

synopsys’ products are written mainly in the c and c languages and utilize industry standards for graphical user interfaces our software runs under unix operating systems such as solaris and hpux and under the redhat linux operating system synopsys’ products are offered on the most widely used hardware platforms including those from sun microsystems hewlettpackard ibm and pcs that are based upon intel and amd microprocessors 

  

sales distribution and backlog 

  

we market our products and services primarily through direct sales and application engineers or support personnel in the united states and principal foreign markets we employ highly skilled engineers and technically proficient sales persons in order to understand our customers’ needs and explain and demonstrate the value of our products 

  

in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 foreign revenues represented 43 35 and 37 respectively of synopsys’ total revenue additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations is contained in note 9 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  information relating to risks associated with foreign operations are described in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—factors that may affect future results—stagnation of foreign economies foreign exchange rate fluctuations or other international issues could adversely affect our performance  

  

we have salessupport centers throughout the united states in addition to our mountain view california headquarters outside the united states we have salessupport offices in canada denmark finland france germany hong kong india israel italy japan the netherlands the people’s republic of china singapore south korea sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom our foreign headquarters is in dublin ireland our offices are further described under part i item 2  properties  

  

in limited circumstances we use distributors to assist us in the sale of certain products in specified markets see note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information about one of our distributors 

  

historically orders and revenue have been lowest in our first fiscal quarter and highest in our fourth fiscal quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next fiscal year we expect the first fiscal quarter will remain our lowest orders and revenue quarter orders and revenue in other quarters will vary based on the particular timing and type of individual contracts entered into with large customers 

  

synopsys’ aggregate noncancelable backlog was approximately 16 billion on november 1 2003 representing a 17 increase from the end of the prior fiscal year aggregate noncancelable backlog includes deferred revenue operational backlog and financial backlog and excludes all items relating to consulting services deferred revenue represents orders for software products license maintenance and other services which have been delivered and billed to the customer but the revenue has not yet been earned operational backlog consists of orders for system and software products sold under perpetual or term licenses and tsls with customer requested ship dates within three months which have not been shipped financial backlog consists of future installments to be billed and received from the customer not yet currently due and payable in the case of a tsl financial backlog includes the full amount of the committed noncancelable order less any amount of revenue that has been recognized on such tsl 

  

we have not historically experienced significant order cancellations 

  

research and development 

  

our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms maintain and enhance our current products develop new products and meet an expanding range of customer requirements research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each business unit synopsys also maintains an advanced technology group which is responsible for exploring new technologies and maintaining strong research relationships outside synopsys within both industry and academia 

  

during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 research and development expenses net of capitalized software development costs were 2859 million 2255 million and 1898 million respectively synopsys capitalized software development costs were approximately 26 million 16 million and 10 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future 

  

manufacturing 

  

synopsys’ manufacturing operations consist of packaging and shipping cdroms containing software products and the related documentation we currently conduct these activities through contract vendors who provide the majority of cdrom replication and ondemand printing and distribution of product media and documentation we deliver an increasing proportion of our software products by electronic means rather than by shipping disks when specified by the customer or required by law synopsys delivers disks to the customer’s site we typically deliver our software products within 10 days of acceptance of customer purchase orders and execution of software license agreements unless the customer requests otherwise 

  

competition 

  

the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities in general we compete on product quality and features postsale support interoperability with other vendors’ products price payment terms and as discussed below the ability to offer a complete design flow 

  

our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services such as cadence design systems inc cadence and mentor graphics corporation and companies that offer products focused on 

  

a discrete phase or phases of the integrated circuit design process during the recent semiconductor downturn we have increasingly competed on the basis of payment terms and price during fiscal 2003 we increasingly agreed to extended payment terms on our tsls negatively affecting our deferred revenue and cash flow from operations in addition in certain situations our competitors offer aggressive discounts on their products as a result average prices may fall and we may lose potential business where we believe a given discount is not in our best interests 

  

increasingly eda companies compete on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical design products rather than on the basis of individual point tools performing a discrete phase of the design process the need to offer an integrated design flow will become increasingly important as ics grow more complex while we have introduced design and verification platforms that integrate many of the products required to design an ic into a unified flow we face significant competition from companies that also offer their own integrated design flows such as cadence and magma design automation inc to be successful in the future we believe we must further integrate our design and verification products which will continue to require significant engineering and development work there can be no guarantee that we will be able to offer a competitive complete design flow to customers if customers fail to adopt our design and verification platforms or if we are unable to develop new discrete design tools or enhance existing ones to add increased functionality or performance our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 

  

product sales and licensing agreements 

  

we typically license our software to customers under nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network license fees depend on the type of license product mix and number of copies of each product licensed in certain cases customers have the right to use our products over a widearea network or to exchange a portion of the software under license for different software products of equal value 

  

we currently offer our software products under three license types renewable tsls renewable term licenses and perpetual licenses for a full discussion of these licenses see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— critical accounting policies — revenue recognition below 

  

with respect to our designware core intellectual property products we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements which provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus in some cases royalties 

  

finally our professional services teams typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project 

  

proprietary rights 

  

synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work however third parties may develop similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future 

  

under our customer agreements and other license agreements in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights for example we are currently 

  

defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense 

  

these types of claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

employees 

  

as of november 1 2003 synopsys had 4362 employees of whom 2885 were based in north america and 1477 were based outside of north america our future financial results depend in part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we participate in a dynamic industry with startup activity and our headquarters is in silicon valley where competition for the most highly skilled technical sales and management employees is intense experience at synopsys is highly valued in the eda and general electronics industry and our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and by startup companies in many industries we have periodically experienced significant employee turnover we can provide no assurances that we can retain our key managerial and technical employees or continue to attract or retain additional highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and we believe our employee relations are good 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

synopsys’ principal offices are located in four adjacent buildings in mountain view california which together provide approximately 400000 square feet of available space this space is leased through february 2015 within one half mile of these buildings in sunnyvale california synopsys occupies approximately 200000 square feet of space in two adjacent buildings which are under lease through april 2007 and approximately 72000 square feet of space in a third building which is under lease through april 2007 we use these buildings for administrative marketing research and development and support activities in addition synopsys leases 16000 square feet of space in pleasanton and fremont california as telecommute centers as a result of fiscal 2002 and 2003 acquisitions we assumed leases of approximately 55000 square feet of space in san jose california 7500 square feet of space in pleasanton and 5000 square feet of space in austin texas none of which we currently occupy 

  

synopsys owns two buildings totaling approximately 230000 square feet on approximately 43 acres of land in hillsboro oregon which we use for administrative marketing research and development and support activities in addition we lease approximately 80000 square feet of space in marlboro massachusetts for sales and support research and development and customer education activities this facility is leased through january 2009 

  

synopsys owns a fourth building in sunnyvale california with approximately 120000 square feet which is leased to a third party through february 2009 synopsys also owns 34 acres of undeveloped land in san jose california and 13 acres of undeveloped land in marlboro massachusetts 

  

synopsys currently leases 32 other offices throughout the united states primarily for sales and support 

  

synopsys leases approximately 45000 square feet in dublin ireland for its foreign headquarters and for research and development purposes this space is leased through april 2026 in addition synopsys leases 34 foreign sales and service offices in canada denmark finland france germany hong kong india israel italy japan the netherlands the people’s republic of china singapore south korea sweden switzerland taiwan 

  

and the united kingdom we also lease research and development facilities in canada france germany india ireland japan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china south korea sweden taiwan and the united kingdom 

  

we believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

synopsys is currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business if management believes a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated we record the amount of the loss or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than another as additional information becomes available we assess any potential liability related to these actions and revise our estimates if necessary based on currently available information management believes the ultimate outcome of these actions individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations however litigation is inherently uncertain and we could therefore receive unfavorable rulings an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting synopsys from selling one or more products an unexpected unfavorable ruling could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods

overview 

  

the following is a summary of the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations and is qualified in its entirety by the fuller discussion contained in this item 7 this summary should be read in conjunction with part i item 1 “business” and is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors set forth in item 7 as described below under “factors that may affect future results” 

  

synopsys is the world leader in electronic design automation eda software used to design complex integrated circuits ics and systemsonchips socs in the global semiconductor and electronics industries our software and intellectual property products and design services provide a complete ic design and verification solution from original concept to the actual chip enabling our customers to bring advanced products to market quickly see “item 1 business” for a more complete description of our business 

  

business environment 

  

as an eda software provider we generate substantially all of our revenues from the semiconductor and electronics industries our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their research and development budgets as a result our revenues are heavily influenced by our customers’ longterm business outlook and willingness to invest in new chip designs 

  

beginning in late calendar 2000 the semiconductor industry entered its steepest and longest downturn of the past 20 years with industry sales dropping by approximately 46 from late 2000 to early 2002 as a result over the past three years our customers have focused on controlling costs and reducing risk including constraining rd expenditures cutting back on their design starts purchasing from fewer suppliers requiring more favorable pricing and payment terms from those suppliers and pursuing consolidation within their own industry further during this downturn many startup semiconductor design companies failed or were acquired and the pace of investment in new companies declined 

  

in response to these conditions we have focused on providing the most technologically advanced products to address each step in the ic design process on integrating these products into broad platforms and on expanding our product offerings our goal is to be the eda technology supplier of choice for our customers as they pursue longerterm broader more flexible relationships with fewer suppliers reflecting this trend in fiscal 2003 we signed 11 new contracts over 25 million up from only three in fiscal 2001 

  

while the semiconductor industry experienced a moderate recovery in 2003 our customers have remained cautious it is therefore not yet clear when improved demand in our own customers’ electronics end markets will cause them to significantly increase their rd spending or their design starts and hence their spending on eda 

  

product developments 

  

as the result of a multiyear strategy based upon focused internal development efforts and selective acquisitions we offer our customers a comprehensive endtoend design flow our suite of system design logic design functional verification physical design and physical verification products enables our customers to take an ic from concept all the way to manufacturing 

  

following the completion of the avant merger in mid2002 we moved quickly to integrate our operations and research and development teams we have also pursued integration of the products themselves in february 2003 we announced the combination of many of our leading ic design products into a single unified platform called the galaxy design platform which now includes seven of our twelve highest revenue products design compiler apolloastro physical compiler primetime hercules starrcxt and dft compiler concurrently with this announcement we also opened access to our milkyway design database which provides a common data repository and improves interoperability among multiple products enabling customers and other eda tool vendors to link their tools directly into the milkyway environment will benefit customers and other eda companies by reducing integration costs and advancing tool interoperability for the electronics industry 

  

we also announced our discovery verification platform in fiscal 2003 which combines many of our verification and nanometer level analysis tools in a unified environment to provide high performance and efficient interaction among these technologies and includes three of our twelve highest revenue products vcs hspice and nanosim 

  

finally in march 2003 we completed our acquisition of numerical technologies inc which specializes in subwavelength photolithographyenabling solutions expanding our offerings of manufacturing technologies and products geared towards small geometry designs

acquisitions 

  

in fiscal 2003 we completed i our acquisition of numerical technologies inc numerical to expand our offerings of design for manufacturing products and ii two other acquisitions we do not consider material for financial statement purposes 

  

in fiscal 2002 we acquired i avant corporation avant a leading developer of software used in the physical design and physical verification phases of ic design ii codesign automation inc codesign a developer of simulation software used in the highlevel verification stage of the chip design process and iii insilicon corporation insilicon which developed marketed and licensed an extensive portfolio of silicon intellectual property 

  

our results of operations include the revenues attributable to products acquired in these mergers that are recognized after the respective merger dates but not any revenues recognized by these acquired companies prior to their respective merger dates in addition these acquisitions caused us to incur charges related to these acquisitions such as amortization of goodwill intangible assets and deferred stock compensation and integration as more fully discussed below 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial statements which we prepare in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing these financial statements we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

revenue recognition  our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition as amended by sop 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and sop 984 deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop 972 software revenue recognition  

  

with respect to software sales synopsys utilizes three license types 

  

   

   

   

we report revenue in three categories upfront license revenue timebased license revenue and services 

  

upfront license revenue includes 

  

   

   

timebased license revenue includes 

  

   

   

services revenue includes 

  

   

   

we allocate revenue on software transactions referred to as an “arrangement” in the accounting literature involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 

  

we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multipleelement arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to consulting accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop 989 and recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term 

  

customers occasionally request the right to convert their existing tsls to perpetual licenses customers pay an incremental fee to convert the tsl to a perpetual license which we recognize upon contract signing in accordance with aicpa technical practice aid tpa 510074 assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met in some situations the contract converting the tsl to a perpetual license is modified to such an extent that a new arrangement exists the changes to the contract may include increases or decreases in the total technology under license changes in payment terms changes in license terms and other pertinent factors in these situations we account for all of the arrangement fees as a new sale and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we have a policy that defines the specific circumstances under which such transactions are accounted for as a new perpetual license sale 

  

we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition specifically in connection with each transaction involving our products we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred iii our fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable we apply these criteria as discussed below 

  

   

   

   

   

   

valuation of intangible assets  we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets consist of purchased technology contract rights intangibles customerinstalled baserelationships trademarks and tradenames covenants not to compete customer backlog and capitalized software factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the acquired entity or technology over the remaining amortization period we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2003 as of october 31 2003 the carrying amount of our intangible assets net was 2856 million 

  

we evaluate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 142 sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the twostep method prescribed by sfas 142 any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal 2003 as of october 31 2003 the carrying amount of our goodwill net was 5507 million 

  

income taxes  the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as of october 31 2003 current net deferred tax assets and longterm liabilities totaled 2484 million and 74 million respectively we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would charge to income an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination 

  

we provide for united states us income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the united states as of october 31 2003 the cumulative amount of earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided is approximately 1767 million as of october 31 2003 the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately 491 million 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts  we estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable on an accountbyaccount basis and establish a specific reserve for any particular receivable when we determine collectibility is not probable in addition we provide a general reserve on all accounts receivable which we calculate as a percentage determined within a specified range of percentages of the outstanding balance in each aged group in determining this percentage we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt expense customer creditworthiness current economic trends international exposures such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful 

  

accounts if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates impairing their ability to make payments we may need to establish additional allowances as of october 31 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts was 83 million 

  

strategic investments  we review our investments in nonpublic companies on a quarterly basis and estimate the amount of any impairment incurred during the current period based on a specific analysis of each investment considering the activities of and events occurring at each of the underlying portfolio companies during the quarter our portfolio companies operate in industries that are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive for equity investments in nonpublic companies where we cannot readily determine market value we assess each investment for indicators of impairment at each quarter end based primarily on achievement of business plan objectives and current market conditions among other factors and information available to us at the time of assessment the primary business plan objectives we consider include achievement of planned financial results completion of capital raising activities the launching of technology the hiring of key employees and the portfolio company’s overall progress on its business plan if we determine an investment in a portfolio company is impaired absent quantitative valuation metrics management estimates the impairment andor the net realizable value of the portfolio investment based on public and privatecompany market comparable information and valuations completed for companies similar to our portfolio companies future adverse changes in market conditions poor operating results of underlying investments and other information obtained after our quarterly assessment could result in additional losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investments thereby requiring a further impairment charge in the future as of october 31 2003 we valued our strategic investments at 86 million 

  

results of operations 

  

synopsys generates revenue primarily from licensing its software and intellectual property from sales of maintenance and from providing consulting services in our licensing activities to respond to our customers’ respective technology flexibility and budget requirements we have offered a variety of license types we generally classify those license types as tbls on which revenue is recognized over time and upfront licenses on which revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment these license types vary significantly in terms of access to technology duration flexibility and payment terms see critical accounting policies — revenue recognition above for a full discussion of our types of licenses and services and the revenue recognition associated with each 

  

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 we principally licensed our software via perpetual licenses and upfront term licenses with the license revenue typically recognized upfront at the time the order was received and maintenance recognized ratably over the maintenance term in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 we introduced time subscription licenses since we bundle products and maintenance in tsls we generally recognize both product and service tsl revenue ratably over the term of the license or if later as payments become due as a result a tsl order results in significantly lower currentperiod revenue than an equalsized order for a perpetual or upfront term license conversely a tsl order will result in higher revenues recognized in future periods than an equalsized order for a perpetual or upfront term license for example for a 120000 order for a perpetual or upfront term license we recognize 120000 of revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and no revenue in future quarters for a 120000 order for a 3year tsl shipped on the first day of the quarter we recognize 10000 of revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and in each of the 11 succeeding quarters 

  

because we generally recognize revenue on tsls ratably over the tsl term our reported revenue dropped significantly following our adoption of tsls in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 in each quarter since adoption however our ratable revenue has grown as tsl orders we receive each quarter contribute revenue that is “layered” over the revenue ratably recognizable from tsl orders we received in prior quarters as the tsl model matures growth in ratable revenue in any quarter will depend on revenue derived from new tsl orders 

  

received in the quarter offset by the loss of revenue from tsls that expire in such quarter or the prior quarter which cease to contribute to revenue due to the “layering” effect revenue may grow from quarter to quarter for some time even if orders do not grow the complete phasein period of the tsl model is difficult to predict as it is affected by mergers and acquisitions and by the precise mix of tsl orders received we expect however that when the tsl model is fully phased in over the long term revenue growth should track orders growth on a percentage basis 

  

our license revenue in any given quarter depends upon the volume of upfront licenses shipped during the quarter the amount of tbl revenue recognized from tbls booked in prior periods and to a much smaller degree the amount of revenue recognized on tbl orders booked during the quarter we set our revenue targets based in large part on orders targets and our expected mix of perpetual licenses term licenses and tsls for a given period if we achieve the total order target but not our target license mix we may not reach our revenue targets if upfront license orders are lower than we expect or may exceed them if upfront license orders are higher than we expect if we achieve the target license mix but orders are below target then we will not meet our revenue targets 

  

the precise mix of orders can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter our historical license order mix since adopting tsls in august 2000 has been 24 upfront licenses and 76 timebased licenses although the percentage of upfront license orders in any given quarter has been as high as 33 and as low as 14 the license mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was 33 upfront and 67 timebased as compared to 27 upfront and 73 timebased for the same period in fiscal 2002 

  

revenue  revenue consists of fees for upfront and timebased licenses of our software and intellectual property products maintenance customer training and consulting we classify revenue as upfront license timebased license or services upfront license revenue consists primarily of perpetual and upfront term software licenses timebased license revenue consists of revenue from our tsls and from term licenses which have extended payment terms as discussed above service revenue consists of maintenance under perpetual and term licenses and fees for consulting services and training 

  

total revenue for fiscal 2003 increased 30 to 11770 million as compared to 9065 million in fiscal 2002 the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2003 is primarily due to i contribution of avant products for a full fiscal year ii continued phasein of the tsl model and iii license renewals with many of our largest japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 a relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we reintroduced term licenses total revenue from term licenses in fiscal 2003 was 36 million 

  

total revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 33 to 9065 million as compared to 6804 million for fiscal 2001 the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 is due primarily to the contribution of avant products from june 2002 through the end of fiscal 2002 and to the ongoing phase in of the tsl license model 

  

upfront license revenue for fiscal 2003 increased 22 to 2983 million as compared to 2452 million in fiscal 2002 the increase in upfront license revenue is primarily due to the contribution of avant products for a full fiscal year and license renewals with many of our largest japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 a relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we began offering to some of our customers that entered into perpetual licenses in excess of 2 million variable maintenance arrangements under which the annual maintenance fee is calculated as a percentage of the net license fee rather than as a fixed percentage of the list price these arrangements accounted for 2200 million of our product sales in fiscal 2003 as compared to 1316 million in fiscal 2002 

  

upfront license revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 50 to 2452 million as compared to 1639 million for fiscal 2001 the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was due to an 

  

increase in perpetual licenses delivered during the period which resulted in large part from the increased volume of perpetual licenses after the avant merger 

  

timebased license revenue for fiscal 2003 increased 65 to 6180 million as compared to 3736 million in fiscal 2002 the increase in timebased license revenue is due to the additional quarters that the tsl license model has been used and to the increased volume of timebased license sales contributed by avant products for a full fiscal year 

  

timebased license revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 114 to 3736 million as compared to 1746 million in fiscal 2001 the increase in ratable license revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to the additional quarters that the tsl license model has been used and to the increased volume of ratable license sales resulting from the avant merger 

  

service revenue for fiscal 2003 decreased 9 to 2607 million as compared to 2877 million in fiscal 2002 service revenue for fiscal 2002 decreased 16 to 2877 million as compared to 3418 million for fiscal 2001 these decreases in service revenue were primarily due to the impact of our adoption of tsls which bundle maintenance with the software and do not contribute any separately recognized service revenue further economic conditions led our customers to reduce their costs by curtailing their use of outside consultants such as our professional services personnel and in some cases discontinuing maintenance on their perpetual licenses in addition customers deferred or cancelled a number of projects in our consulting backlog and reduced certain expenditures on training and finally our adoption of variable maintenance perpetual arrangements in fiscal 2002 has substantially lowered our maintenance fees from perpetual licenses 

  

related party transactions  revenues derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 95 and 79 of fiscal 2003 and 2002 revenues respectively andy d bryant intel corporation’s executive vice president and chief financial and enterprise services officer also serves on our board of directors management believes the transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm’s length basis 

  

revenue seasonality  historically orders and revenue have been lowest in our first fiscal quarter and highest in our fourth fiscal quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next fiscal year we expect the first fiscal quarter will remain our lowest orders and revenues quarter orders and revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular timing and type of individual contracts entered into with large customers 

  

revenue — product groups  for management reporting purposes we organize our products and services into five distinct groups galaxy design platform discovery verification platform intellectual property ip new ventures and professional services  other the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to these groups as a percentage of total revenue for the last twelve quarters we include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods for presentation purposes we allocate maintenance which represented approximately 18 of our total revenue and approximately 84 of our total services revenue for fiscal 2003 to the products to which those support services relate further with the adoption of our platform strategy in fiscal 2003 we redefined our product groups and have reclassified prior period revenues in accordance with this new grouping to provide a consistent presentation 

  

between any two quarters the percentage of our total revenue from each group fluctuates based on the mix of upfront versus timebased orders received for these products during the quarter further since our adoption of tsls in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 an increasing percentage of the revenue in a given quarter in the galaxy design platform discovery verification platform and new ventures groups is from customer orders placed in preceding quarters accordingly for the galaxy design platform discovery verification platform and new ventures groups quartertoquarter changes are not necessarily indicative of fundamental strength or weakness in those groups 

  

   

galaxy design platform  our galaxy design platform includes our logic synthesis physical synthesis physical design timing analysis signal integrity analysis and physical verification products our principal products in this category at october 31 2003 were design compiler apollo astro physical compiler prime time hercules star rxct and dft compiler 

  

revenue for this platform increased significantly in percentage and absolute dollar terms following the avant merger in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 primarily because this product group represented the largest portion of avant’s revenue before the acquisition the percentage increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 was due to a number of large orders many of which were perpetual licenses by japanese customers in that quarter going forward we believe physical implementation physical synthesis and design analysis products will account for an increasing share of galaxy design platform revenues relative to our logic synthesis products as customers recognize the importance of using physical level and design analysis tools to address design challenges particular to small geometry designs 

  

discovery verification platform  our discovery verification platform includes our verification and simulation products our principal products in this category are vcs hspice nanosim formality vera and system studio though the avant merger added few verification products revenue for this platform as a percentage of total revenue has remained fairly consistent reflecting continued adoption of these tools by our customers in absolute dollar terms revenue from this platform has generally increased consistently with our overall averages 

  

intellectual property  our ip products include the designware library of ic design components and verification models and insilicon products we acquired in september 2002 ip revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 principally because we acquired few ip products in the avant merger but increased beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 due to increased sales of our designware cores and products acquired in the insilicon merger particularly in the communications and connectivity areas 

  

new ventures  our new ventures products include our analog and mixed signal and design for manufacturing tools we had no revenue from these tools prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2002 when we acquired avant new ventures revenue as a percentage of total revenue has since increased moderately primarily as a result of the growing need for tools and methodologies required for smaller geometry designs and has increased in absolute dollar terms consistently with our overall averages 

  

professional services  other  the professional services group provides consulting services including design methodology assistance specialized systems design services turnkey design and training as a percentage of total revenue revenue from this product group declined significantly through the second quarter of fiscal 2003 reflecting a decrease in consulting orders from our customers due to difficult economic conditions as discussed above under revenue  and the fact that avant did not have a significant professional services business 

  

workforce realignment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we decided to realign our operations effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 in order to focus resources on more strategic areas of investment and to become more operationally efficient this realignment affected a total of approximately 240 employees 140 in the us and 100 outside the us in all departments in domestic and foreign locations the associated charge for fiscal 2003 was 149 million consisting of severance and other termination benefits which are generally much higher in locations outside the us and is reflected in the consolidated statement of income as follows 

  

   

we expect to incur additional costs between 3 million and 4 million during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2004 related to the consolidation of excess facilities and to the termination of certain lease obligations 

  

temporary shutdown of operations  during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we had a fourday shutdown of operations in north america as a costsaving measure the savings relates primarily to salaries and benefits as follows 

  

   

work force reduction  we reduced our workforce during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the purpose was to reduce expenses by decreasing the number of employees in all departments in domestic and foreign locations as a result we decreased our workforce by approximately 200 and 175 employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and the second quarter of fiscal 2002 respectively the associated charge for fiscal 2003 was 44 million as compared to 39 million for fiscal 2002 the charge consists of severance and other termination benefits and is reflected in the consolidated statements of income as follows 

  

   

cost of revenue  cost of revenue consists of the cost of product revenue cost of service revenue cost of ratable license revenue and amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation cost of product revenue includes personnel and related costs production costs product packaging documentation and 

  

amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased technology cost of service revenue includes consulting services personnel and related costs associated with providing training and maintenance on perpetual and term licenses cost of ratable license revenue includes the costs of product and services related to our tsls cost of product revenue cost of service revenue and cost of ratable license revenue during any period are heavily dependent on the mix of software orders received during such period 

  

cost of revenue amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core developed technology related to acquisitions which occurred in fiscal 2003 and 2002 there was no cost of revenue amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation in fiscal 2001 total amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation included in cost of revenues is as follows 

  

   

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2003 increased to 20 as compared to 19 in fiscal 2002 this increase is primarily due to an increase in amortization of contract rights intangible and coredeveloped technology recorded as a result of our acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and 2002 the cost of our realignment of operations totaling 26 million as discussed above under workforce realignment additional royalties of 15 million and other termination benefits of 12 million as discussed above under work force reduction our total product costs are relatively fixed and do not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or changes in revenue recognition methods 

  

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2002 remained relatively flat at 19 as compared to fiscal 2001 cost of revenue excluding amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation as a percentage of total revenue decreased due to the increase in quarterly amortization of deferred revenue and backlog which is an inherent result of the use of the ratable license model until fully phased in and due to the fact that other cost of revenue components remained relatively flat however this decrease as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2002 was offset by the commencement of amortization of the contract rights intangible and coredeveloped technology recorded as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 

  

research and development research and development expenses for fiscal 2003 increased 27 to 2859 million as compared to 2255 million in fiscal 2002 the increase consists primarily of i 307 million in research and development personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and including additional employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of an increase in the number of stock option exercises during the fiscal year ii 222 million in increased human resources information technology and facilities costs to research and development as a result of the increase in research and development headcount as a percentage of total headcount iii 63 million as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment and iv 23 million in consulting services these increases are partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 28 million 

  

research and development expenses for fiscal 2002 increased 19 to 2255 million as compared to 1898 million for fiscal 2001 the increase in expenses is due to increases of i 287 million in compensation and compensationrelated costs as a result of an increase in research and development headcount due to the avant merger ii 113 million in human resources technology and facilities costs as a result of increased research and 

  

development staffing and iii 42 million in depreciation expense these increases were partially offset by decreases of i 54 million in consulting expenses and ii 43 million of other expenses including facilities travel communications supplies and recruiting as a result of our cost reduction programs 

  

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2003 increased 17 to 3107 million as compared to 2648 million in fiscal 2002 the increase consists primarily of i 424 million in additional sales and marketing personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and including additional employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of an increase in the number of stock option exercises during the fiscal year offset by savings from a fourday shutdown of operations in north america ii 48 million as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment and iii 27 million in additional travel expenses these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 38 million in human resources technology and facilities costs to sales and marketing expenses as a result of a decrease in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount 

  

sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2002 decreased 3 to 2648 million as compared to 2740 million in fiscal 2001 the overall decrease is due to decreases of i 84 million in human resources technology and facilities costs as a result of a decrease in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount ii 13 million in employee functions iii 14 million in consulting expenses and iv 28 million in other expenses including communications and supplies foundation contributions professional services subscriptions and memberships as a result of our cost reduction efforts these decreases were partially offset by increases of i 48 million in compensation and related costs attributable to an increase in sales and marketing headcount resulting from the avant merger and ii 19 million in travel relating to customer visits to discuss the integration of synopsys and avant products 

  

general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2003 increased 15 to 900 million as compared to 785 million in fiscal 2002 the increase consists primarily of i 128 million in additional general and administrative personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and including additional employer taxes incurred as a result of an increase in the number of stock option exercises during the current year ii 70 million in depreciation on upgrades to our information technology infrastructure iii 57 million in facilities costs due to new leases during the current year and the expiration of a sublease on one of synopsys’ buildings in june 2003 iv 37 million in professional services costs patent prosecution expenditures sarbanesoxley act compliance and litigation v 28 million in maintenance agreements covering more software and computing equipment due to acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and vi 12 million related to the realignment of operations as discussed above under workforce realignment  these increases were offset by a decrease of i 142 million in human resources technology and facilities costs to general and administrative expenses as a result of a decrease in general and administrative headcount as a percentage of total headcount and ii a decrease of 66 million in bad debt expense as accounts receivable aging improved year over year 

  

general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002 increased 13 to 785 million as compared to 697 million in fiscal 2001 the overall increase is due to increases of i 111 million in facilities costs as a result of an increased number of sites due to the avant merger ii 70 million in compensation and compensationrelated costs as a result of increased headcount due to the avant merger iii 56 million in professional service fees iv 22 million in communications costs v 16 million in equipment to update licenses for our internal enterprise application systems vi 14 million in depreciation and vii 29 million in other expenses including travel and property tax assessments these increases were offset by decreases of i 200 million as a result of decreased general and administrative headcount as a percentage of total headcount and ii 39 million in consulting costs as a result of our cost reduction efforts 

  

integration costs nonrecurring integration costs incurred relate to merger activities which are not included in the purchase consideration under emerging issues task force number 953 eitf 953 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  these costs are expensed as 

  

incurred during fiscal 2002 integration costs were 1285 million and consisted primarily of i 950 million related to the premium for the insurance policy acquired in conjunction with the avant merger ii 147 million related to writedowns of synopsys facilities and property under the management approved facility exit plan for the avant merger iii 100 million and 07 million related to severance costs for synopsys employees who were terminated and costs associated with transition employees as a result of the avant and insilicon mergers respectively iv 13 million related to the writeoff of software licenses owned by synopsys which were originally purchased from avant v 37 million goodwill impairment charge related to a prior synopsys acquisition as a result of the acquisition of avant and vi 12 million and 19 million of other expenses including travel and certain professional fees for the avant and codesign mergers respectively 

  

inprocess research and development purchased inprocess research and development iprd of 199 million and 877 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively represents the writeoff of inprocess technologies associated with our acquisitions of numerical in fiscal 2003 and avant and insilicon in fiscal 2002 there were no acquisitions during fiscal 2001 at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses accordingly these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition dates of each of the acquired companies 

  

valuation of iprd the value assigned to acquired inprocess technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established the value of inprocess technology is then segmented into two classifications i developed technology completed and ii inprocess technology tobecompleted giving explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and to be created by synopsys after the acquisition these value creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors i timebased data ii costbased data and iii complexitybased data 

  

the value of the inprocess technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the income producing capabilities of the inprocess technologies under this approach the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified products within the classification segments revenue estimates were based on i individual product revenues ii anticipated growth rates iii anticipated product development and introduction schedules iv product sales cycles and v the estimated life of a product’s underlying technology from the revenue estimates operating expense estimates including costs of sales general and administrative selling and marketing income taxes and a use charge for contributory assets were deducted to arrive at operating income revenue growth rates were estimated by management for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors expected industry trends the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product’s underlying technology operating expense estimates reflect synopsys’ historical expense ratios additionally these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition 

  

the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology is our weightedaverage cost of capital wacc taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at this time 

  

numerical  on march 1 2003 we acquired numerical which specialized in subwavelength lithographyenabling solutions the iprd expense related to the numerical acquisition was 183 million numerical had five iprd projects—phase shift masking psm subwavelength software equipment software cadabra and computer aided transcription system cats—representing 25 7 6 5 and 57 respectively of the total 

  

iprd value these projects were expected to be completed shortly following the completion of the merger psm subwavelength software and cats were completed in fiscal 2003 cadabra was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 the equipment software project consists of inprocess technology for multiple products these products were either completed in fiscal 2003 discontinued or are expected to be integrated with other synopsys products during fiscal 2004 expenditures to complete numerical’s iprd approximate the original estimates 

  

insilicon  on september 20 2002 we acquired insilicon a leading provider of connectivity semiconductor intellectual property used by semiconductor and systems companies to design systemsonchip that are critical components of innovative wired and wireless products the iprd expense related to the insilicon acquisition was 52 million insilicon had three iprd projects—dela peripheral component interconnect pci express and universal serial business physical usb phy—accounting for 54 23 and 23 of the total iprd value respectively these projects were 25 67 and 20 complete at the time of acquisition respectively during fiscal 2003 synopsys decided to no longer pursue the dela project pci express is approximately 80 complete and usb phy has been completed expenditures to complete usb phy and expected expenditures to complete pci express approximate the original estimates 

  

avant on june 6 2002 we acquired avant a leading developer of software used in the physical design and physical verification stages of ic design the iprd expense related to the avant merger was 825 million the principal inprocess technologies were identified based on the following product families 

  

   

these projects were completed during fiscal 2002 and 2003 expenditures to complete the acquired inprocess technologies approximated the original estimates 

  

the risks associated with acquired research and development are considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit to us or meet market expectations 

  

amortization of goodwill intangible assets and deferred stock compensation amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of trademarks tradenames customer relationships and covenants not to compete and is included in operating expenses as follows 

  

   

the increase in amortization of intangible assets is due primarily to fiscal 2003 and 2002 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of sfas 142 on november 1 2002 

  

the following table presents the estimated future amortization of deferred stock compensation reported in both cost of revenue and operating expenses 

  

   

impairment of intangible assets in fiscal 2002 we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of 38 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value approximately 37 million and 01 million are included in integration expense and amortization of intangible assets respectively on the consolidated statement of operations the impairment charge is primarily attributable to certain technology acquired from and goodwill related to the acquisition of stanza inc stanza in 1999 during fiscal 2002 we determined that we would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology as products acquired in the merger with avant provided customers with superior capabilities as a result we do not anticipate any future sales of the stanza product 

  

in fiscal 2001 we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of 22 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value approximately 18 million and 04 million are included in cost of revenues and amortization of intangible assets respectively on the consolidated statement of operations the impairment charge is attributable to certain technology acquired from and goodwill related to the acquisition of eagle design automation inc eagle in 1997 during fiscal 2001 we determined that we would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology as a result we do not anticipate any future sales of the eagle product 

  

there were no impairment charges during fiscal 2003 

  

other expense income net  other income net was 241 million in fiscal 2003 and consisted primarily of i realized gain on investments of 207 million ii rental income of 63 million iii interest income of 52 million iv impairment charges related to certain assets in our venture portfolio of 45 million vii foundation contributions of 21 million and viii interest expense of 16 million

other income net was 838 million in fiscal 2001 and consisted primarily of i a gain of 106 million on the sale of our silicon libraries business to artisan components inc ii 58 million in impairment charges related to certain assets in our venture portfolio iii realized gains on investments of 553 million iv rental income of 86 million v interest income of 128 million and vi other miscellaneous income including amortization of premium forwards and foreign exchange gains and losses recognized during the fiscal year of 23 million 

  

termination of agreement to acquire ikos systems inc on july 2 2001 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization the ikos merger agreement with ikos systems inc the ikos merger agreement provided for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of ikos common stock by synopsys 

  

on december 7 2001 mentor graphics corporation mentor commenced a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ikos common stock at 1100 per share subject to a number of conditions on march 12 2002 synopsys and ikos executed a termination agreement by which the parties terminated the ikos merger agreement and pursuant to which ikos paid synopsys the 55 million termination fee required by the ikos merger agreement this termination fee and 24 million of expenses incurred in conjunction with the acquisition are included in other income net on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended october 31 2002 synopsys subsequently executed a revised termination agreement with mentor and ikos in order to add mentor as a party thereto 

  

effect of new accounting standards 

  

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  we adopted sfas 142 on november 1 2002 and ceased amortizing goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july 1 2001 in addition as of november 1 2002 we assessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets recorded on the balance sheet and also tested goodwill for impairment per sfas 142 in our impairment analysis we determined we have one reporting unit we completed the goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 and found no indicators of impairment this impairment review was based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization as of october 31 2003 unamortized goodwill was 5507 million which in accordance with sfas 142 we will not amortize 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 2836 million or 68 to 6984 million as of october 31 2003 from 4147 million as of october 31 2002 our source of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments over the last three years has been from funds generated from our business including cash on hand from companies we have acquired 

  

cash provided by operations was 3915 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to cash used by operations of 1810 million in fiscal 2002 cash flow in fiscal 2002 reflected the payment of 3358 million in insurance premiums related to settlement of litigation between avant which we acquired in june 2002 and cadence resulting in a net loss for the year cash provided by operations is directly related to the payment terms we grant on sales of our software and services during fiscal 2003 we have increasingly granted extended payment terms to our customers negatively affecting cash flow from operations cash flow from operations in 2003 reflected a significant cash tax benefit resulting form the net loss in fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2003 cash was provided by net income adjusted for noncash related items for cash flows related to hedging activities and by an increase in deferred revenue due to continued sales of tsls cash used for changes in working capital balances included decreases in accounts payable accrued liabilities and accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased as a result of payments of mergerrelated accruals commissions and yearend bonuses partially offset by current year accruals accounts receivable decreased due to the timing of installment billings to customers on longterm arrangements 

  

cash used in investing activities was 2583 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 2757 million in fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2003 the following occurred i cash paid for acquisitions totaled 1677 million ii net purchases of short and longterm investments totaled 378 million and iii capital expenditures totaled 501 million in fiscal 2002 the following occurred i cash received from acquisitions totaled 1683 million ii proceeds from net sales of investments totaled 1578 million and iii capital expenditures totaled 488 million 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 742 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to cash used in financing activities of 518 million in fiscal 2002 the increase of 1260 million in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to an increase in proceeds of 2151 million from the sale of shares pursuant to our 

  

employee stock option plans during fiscal 2003 offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock during fiscal 2003 synopsys repurchased treasury stock of 2607 million as compared to 1717 million in fiscal 2002 

  

accounts receivable net of allowances decreased 62 million or 3 to 2010 million as of october 31 2003 from 2072 million as of october 31 2002 days sales outstanding calculated based on revenues for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable at the balance sheet date decreased to 58 days as of october 31 2003 from 61 days as of october 31 2002 the decrease in days sales outstanding is due in part to the timing of large cash collections realized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 

  

on november 22 2002 and december 16 2002 we made payments to cadence totaling 200 million and 2450 million respectively under the terms of the settlement agreement relating to litigation between cadence and avant see note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

on march 1 2003 we completed our acquisition of numerical technologies inc we paid numerical common stock holders 700 in cash in exchange for each share of numerical common stock owned as of the merger date or approximately 2402 million in total and 1613 million net of cash held by numerical at the merger date we paid for numerical common stock out of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months

preapprovals of nonaudit services by audit committee 

  

pursuant to section 10ai3 of the exchange act during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 the audit committee preapproved the following nonaudit services to be performed by kpmg llp our independent auditors 

  

   

   

factors that may affect future results 

  

weakness or budgetary caution in the semiconductor and electronics industries would negatively impact our business 

  

the semiconductor and electronics industries experienced steep declines in orders and revenue in 2001 and 2002 before recovering moderately in 2003 further recovery is subject to significant risks and these manufacturers have been cautious to adopt an improved outlook on demand for their products accordingly they may continue to constrain their eda investments and we cannot predict whether or when further recovery will translate into increased eda investments should our customers and prospective customers remain cautious in their eda purchases due to market conditions or other factors our business operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

  

the eda industry is highly competitive and competition may have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 

  

we compete with other eda vendors that offer a broad range of products and services such as cadence design systems and mentor graphics corporation and with eda vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process we also compete with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities if we fail to compete effectively our business will be materially and adversely affected 

  

we compete principally on technology leadership product quality and features postsale support interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products price and payment terms additional competitive challenges include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our revenue and earnings fluctuate which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline 

  

many factors affect our revenue and earnings making it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period including customer demand license terms and the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold accordingly stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance if our financial results or targets do not meet investor and analyst expectations our stock price could decline 

  

the following are some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the decline in starts of new ic designs industry consolidation and other potentially longterm trends may have an adverse affect on the eda industry including demand for our products and services 

  

technology innovations such as systemonachip designs and ic designs with features of 130 nanometers and below have substantially increased the complexity cost and risk of designing and manufacturing ics these trends require semiconductor manufactures to purchase increasingly sophisticated eda software and predesigned and preverified ip components creating market opportunity for us at the same time they contribute along with the downturn in the semiconductor industry in 2001 and 2002 to the following potentially longterm trends 

  

   

   

   

these trends if sustained could have an adverse effect on the eda industry including the demand for our products and services 

  

businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project 

  

we have acquired a number of companies in recent years and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we may acquire additional companies during fiscal 2002 we acquired avant insilicon and codesign during fiscal 2003 we acquired numerical innologic systems inc and the verification ip assets of qualis inc bidding for future acquisitions may be intense which may make it difficult for us to acquire additional companies at acceptable prices if at all 

  

in addition to direct costs acquisitions pose a number of risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us we can provide no assurances that any acquisition will have a positive effect on our performance furthermore if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology we could be required to write down the goodwill associated with such product or technology these writedowns if significant could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

stagnation of foreign economies foreign exchange rate fluctuations or other international issues could adversely affect our performance 

  

during fiscal 2003 we derived 43 of our revenue from outside north america as compared to 35 during fiscal 2002 foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic political and health conditions including the effects of international political conflict and hostilities and the outbreak of diseases such as sars in particular continued weakness in the telecommunications equipment business would adversely impact many of our largest europeanbased customers and which would cause them to curtail their eda investments while our sales in japan were relatively strong during fiscal 2003 the japanese economy remains generally weak and future growth is thus difficult to predict furthermore achievement of our overall orders and revenue plans assume sales growth in the asia pacific region which may not occur if growth in the rest of the world’s economies does not accelerate 

  

our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies particularly the 

  

euro and to a lesser extent the japanese yen if the us dollar should continue to weaken in fiscal 2004 relative to other currencies particularly the euro our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

a failure to recruit and retain key employees would have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete 

  

to be successful we must attract and retain key technical sales and managerial employees including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and competition for these individuals is intense companies in the eda industry and in the general electronics industry value experience at synopsys accordingly our employees including employees who have joined synopsys in connection with acquisitions are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and to a lesser extent our customers in the past we have had high employee turnover which may recur in the future our failure to recruit and retain key technical sales and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we issue stock options as a key component of our overall compensation recently enacted regulations of the nasdaq national market regarding stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult for us to grant stock options to employees in the future in addition the fasb and other regulatory bodies have proposed changes to generally accepted accounting principles gaap that may require us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options because of these enacted and proposed changes it is possible that we may in the future incur increased cash compensation costs as a substitute for reduced stock option grants may lose top employees to nonpublic startup companies or may generally find it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

  

despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products software products frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products could cause us to lose revenues or market share increase our service costs subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

failing to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology to protect this technology we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide we can provide no assurances that these agreements will not be breached that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors moreover certain foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright or trade secret protection for any reason or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies however there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 

  

from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 

  

under our customer agreements and other license agreements in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights as a result we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights for example we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by a japanese electronics company we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense 

  

these types of claims can result in costly and timeconsuming litigation require us to enter into royalty arrangements subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to changes in financial accounting standards which may affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business 

  

accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations significantly effecting the way we license our products as a result of the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act and the review of accounting policies by the sec and national and international accounting standards bodies the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate future changes in financial accounting standards including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition may have a significant effect on our reported results including reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of the changes 

  

the fasb and various federal legislative proposals have proposed changes to gaap that may require us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options synopsys currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stockbased awards to our employees under this standard we generally do not consider stock option grants issued under our employee stock option plans to be compensation when the exercise price of the stock option is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant if any change to gaap is adopted that requires us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options our reported results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our operating results 

  

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition we are undergoing an audit of our federal income taxes for fiscal 2001 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation there could be a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

computer viruses intrusion attempts on our information technology infrastructure and denial of service attacks could seriously disrupt our business operations 

  

recently “hackers” and others have created a number of computer viruses or otherwise initiated “denial of service” attacks on computer networks and systems our information technology infrastructure is regularly subject to various attacks and intrusion efforts of differing seriousness and sophistication while we diligently maintain our information technology infrastructure and continuously implement protections against such viruses 

  

or intrusions if our defensive measures fail or should similar defensive measures by our customers fail our business could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we have adopted antitakeover provisions which may delay or prevent changes in control of management 

  

we have a number of provisions that could have antitakeover effects in 1997 our board of directors adopted a preferred shares rights plan commonly referred to as a “poison pill” in addition our board of directors has the authority without further action by our stockholders to issue additional shares of common stock to fix the rights and preferences of authorized but undesignated shares of preferred stock and to issue shares of such preferred stock these and other provisions of synopsys’ restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may deter hostile takeovers or delay or prevent changes in control of synopsys management including transactions in which synopsys’ stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 

  

if export controls affecting our products are expanded our business will be adversely affected 

  

the us department of commerce regulates the sale and shipment of certain technologies by us companies to foreign countries to date we believe we have successfully complied with applicable export regulations however if the us department of commerce places significant export controls on our existing future or acquired products our business would be materially and adversely affected 

  

terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may damage or disrupt synopsys our employees facilities partners suppliers or customers or cause unpredictable swings in foreign currency exchange rates all of which could significantly impact our results of operations and expenses and financial condition the potential for future terrorist attacks the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways we cannot presently predict we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by acts of war 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk to achieve this objective we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy none of our investments are held for trading purposes our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument 

  

the following table presents the carrying value and related weightedaverage total return for our investment portfolio the carrying value approximates fair value as of october 31 2003 in accordance with our investment policy the weightedaverage maturities of our total invested funds do not exceed one year 

  

   

as of october 31 2003 the stated maturities of our current investments are 366 million within one year 840 million within one to five years 138 million within five to ten years and 396 million after ten years these investments are generally classified as availableforsale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax realized gains and losses on sales of shortterm investments have not been material 

  

our strategic investment portfolio consists of minority equity investments in publicly traded companies and investments in privately held companies the securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as availableforsale securities accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method these securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value 

  

see note 5 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information on investment maturity dates longterm debt and equity price risk related to our longterm investments and carrying value and writedowns of our strategic investments 

  

foreign currency risk the functional currency of each of synopsys’ foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for our principal irish subsidiary whose functional currency is the us dollar at the present time we hedge only i those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and ii forecasted accounts receivable backlog and accounts payable denominated in nonfunctional currencies our hedging activities are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on the value of these balances the success of these activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of balances denominated in various currencies we do not attempt to hedge operating expenses denominated in any foreign currency looking forward to the extent our estimates of various balances denominated in nonfunctional currencies prove inaccurate then we will not be completely hedged and we will record a gain or loss depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy we can provide no assurances that our hedging transactions will be effective 

  

  

foreign currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we have limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk furthermore we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes 

  

effective may 4 2003 we changed the functional reporting currency of our principal irish subsidiary from the euro to the us dollar because an increasing percentage of that subsidiary’s sales in europe and asia and the resulting accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars the expenses of our irish subsidiary which manages all of our european offices are predominantly in euros the accounts receivable and the expenses of our japanese subsidiary are denominated in yen 

  

the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31 2003 due to the shortterm nature of these contracts the contract rates approximate the weightedaverage currency exchange rates as of october 31 2003 these forward contracts mature in approximately thirty days and contracts are rolled forward on a monthly basis to match firmly committed transactions 

  

   

net unrealized gains of approximately 193 million and 100 million net of tax on the outstanding forward contracts as of october 31 2003 and 2002 respectively are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet net unrealized losses net of tax on the outstanding forward contracts as of october 31 2001 were not material net cash inflows on maturing forward contracts during fiscal 2003 were 377 million

item 1 business

introduction

    synopsys inc synopsys or the company is a leading supplier of electronic
design  automation  eda  software  to the  global  electronics  industry  the
companys products are used by designers of integrated circuits ics including
systemonachip  ics and the  electronic  products  such as  computers  cell
phones and internet routers that use such ics to automate significant portions
of their chip design process  ics are  distinguished by the speed at which they
run  their area  the amount of power they consume and the cost of  production
the companys  products  offer its customers the  opportunity to design ics that
are optimized for speed  area  power  consumption and production  cost  while
reducing  overall  design time  synopsys also provides  consulting  services to
assist  customers  with  their  ic  designs  as well as  training  and  support
services synopsys was incorporated in delaware in 1987

the role of eda in the electronics industry

    over  the past  three  decades  technology  advances  in the  semiconductor
industry have dramatically increased the size speed and capacity of ics

    o   the  number of  transistors  that can be  placed  on a chip has  doubled
        roughly  every 18  months  a  phenomenon  known  as  moores  law  a
        stateoftheart ic may hold over 50 million  transistors  this is made
        possible in large part  because the width of the features on the chip is
        steadily  shrinking  mainstream ic designs today are produced at a 018
        micron  process  with  advanced  chips being  produced at a 013 micron
        process  over the next several  years  it is expected that the bulk of
        production will shift to 013 micron or below  chip  manufacturers  are
        beginning to design andor produce chips at a 009 micron process

    o   the speed at which chips operate has steadily increased microprocessors
        operating  at more than 2  gigahertz  a speed that was unheard of a few
        years ago are available today

    o   chips are also  becoming  more  economical  in their power  consumption
        which is necessary to drive more and more powerful handheld devices

    o   increasingly  functions  that formerly  were  performed by multiple ics
        attached to a printed circuit board are being combined in a single chip
        referred to as a systemonachip



                                       1

    combined these changes have fostered the development of computers wireless
communications  networks   handheld  personal  digital  assistants   internet
routers  and many other goods and  services  with  tremendous  capabilities  at
relatively low cost

    while the  capabilities  of ics have  increased  competition and continuing
innovation   have   shortened  the  life  cycle  of  electronic   products   so
timetomarket  is crucial to the  success  of a product  timetomarket  for a
product is in part  determined by the time it takes to design the chip that will
run such product eda software plays a critical role in reducing  timetomarket
for new  products by providing ic  designers  with tools and  techniques  to a
reduce  the time and  manual  effort  required  to  design  analyze  and verify
individual  ics b improve the  performance and density of complex ic designs
c   enhance   the   reliability   of  the  ic  design  and  d   improve  the
manufacturability of the design

the design process

    in simplified  form  the design of an integrated  circuit  consists of five
basic steps

    system design first a designer describes the functions that the chip is to
perform in a  specialized  highlevel  computer  language  during  this  phase
designers perform high level architectural design tradeoffs  to determine  for
example  which  algorithms to use to implement the design  and the portions of
the functionality to implement in hardware versus software at the completion of
this  phase  the  designer  produces  a  register  transfer  level  or  rtl
description of the chip  most of this process is completed  manually  although
there is a small but growing  market for products that help automate  design and
verification at the system level

    logic synthesis  after the designer is satisfied with the rtl code a logic
synthesis  program  converts  the rtl code into a logical  diagram  of the chip
related  programs  insert the  circuitry  that will be required to test the chip
after  manufacture  a gate level so called  because it describes the various
groups of transistors or gates required to implement the chip data file or
net list is produced  in addition in a growing number of designs the logic
synthesis phase is performed  together with a portion of physical  design  this
combined  process  known as physical  synthesis  produces a file  containing
placed gates  which describes the logic blocks and includes information about
where they will be physically  located  or placed  on a chip see discussion
below  under  current  issues  facing ic  designers  in a  growing  number of
systemonachip  ics  in  which  multiple  functions  previously  captured  on
multiple  chips  are  combined  in a single  chip  designers  are  increasingly
performing  design  planning  either  before  or in  conjunction  with  logic
synthesis  in design  planning  the  designer  determines  the location of the
functional blocks that will be captured on the  systemonachip and plans the
principal  wire  connections  between  the  blocks   logic  synthesis  is  then
performed  more or less  independently  on each  block  before the blocks are
stitched back together

    functional  verification  at this stage the designer  uses  simulation  and
related programs to verify that the design successfully  performed the functions
that the designer  intended  by feeding an exhaustive array of potential inputs
into  a  specialized  program  simulating  the  functioning  of the  chip  as
designed  and  checking to confirm  that the outputs  match what was  expected
techniques that use advanced  mathematical  calculations  rather than simulation
are also used the designer also uses a timing analysis  program to confirm that
the chip as designed will operate at the speed the designer intended

    physical design if the designer is satisfied with the results of high level
verification the transistors and all of the wires connecting each one of them
are mapped out in a series of transformations  that gradually gets more and more
detailed  first  the  location  on the chip  die of each  block of the chip is
finalized  and the location of each transistor  within each block is determined
 a process known as  placement   then all of the  connections  between the
transistors are determined  a process known as routing the result is one or
more data files that can be read by physical  verification  programs see below
or by the equipment used to manufacture the chip

    physical  verification  before  sending  the  design  data  file  to a chip
manufacturer  for  fabrication  a series  of  further  verification  steps  are
undertaken  the  designer  must confirm that the chip as placed and routed will

                                       2

operate at the speed  anticipated  during the logic design  phase  the designer
also  must  check  for  unintended  electrical  effects  that  may  arise  as  a
consequence of placing  certain  portions of the chip or routing certain of its
wires  too close  together  or  otherwise  inefficiently  in  addition  the
designer must verify that the final design complies with all of the design rules
set forth by the party that will manufacture the chip finally the designer may
need to add  features to the design to ensure that the chip can be  manufactured
successfully

    the foregoing  discussion has been greatly simplified  in the actual design
of a chip each of these steps has a number of different elements  the steps or
the different  elements within the steps may be undertaken in a different order
or repeated  multiple  times  and as  described  below  several of the steps
especially  logic design and physical  design are becoming more  integrated with
each  other  in any  event  if at any stage of the  process  the chip does not
perform as intended  then the designer must go back one or more steps to either
redesign  the rtl  redesign  the  logic  rerun the  verification  or redo the
physical  design of the chip  each iteration  takes time and the more time the
process takes the more expensive the process becomes and the more difficult it
will be for the designer to meet his or her timetomarket goals

current issues facing ic designers

    as  chip  technology   continues  to  advance   and   particularly  as  the
stateoftheart  in chip  design  moves to a 013  micron  and  below  process
synopsys customers are facing a number of difficult design challenges

    timing  closure  ensuring that a chip will run at the desired speed becomes
substantially more difficult when transistor sizes are 018 micron and below at
larger  transistor  feature sizes ic designers could use standard  estimates of
chip timing  during the logic design  phase  and be  confident  that the timing
characteristics  would be preserved  through the physical  design phase at 018
micron and below  these estimates become  increasingly  unreliable  to address
this problem  designers will  increasingly  need products that integrate  logic
design  and  physical  design  as a result  of  synopsys  merger  with  avant
corporation synopsys now offers its customers a complete portfolio of logic and
physical  design  products  synopsys is currently  working to  integrate  these
products with a single chip implementation  platform based on a common database
common  timing  constraints  and  libraries  integration of logic and physical
design  products will greatly improve the  correlation  between  original timing
estimates after logic design and timing results after physical design

    signal integrity closure signal integrity refers to a variety of electrical
effects that can cause  circuits to behave in  undesirable  ways the electrical
characteristics  of ics of 013 micron and below cause previously  insignificant
effects to become problematic  these effects include crosstalk  voltage drop
and electromigration  crosstalk  in particular  is becoming a major problem
for  advanced  designs  today  in order to address  signal  integrity  problems
designers need products that help them analyze prevent and repair errors caused
by signal integrity issues

    verification  verification is the process of ensuring at various stages of
the  design  process  that a chip will  perform as  intended  as the number of
transistors on a chip grows the verification  problem grows  geometrically  in
fact with todays chips  verification  often is the single most time consuming
and  resource  intensive  aspect of the  overall  design  process  verification
products must offer  customers a combination of speed  accuracy and the ability
to focus on the portions of the chip most likely to cause problems

    manufacturing  closure as the features on a chip continue to shrink it has
become more  difficult  to  faithfully  translate  the design as produced by eda
tools into the intricate pattern of wires and transistors on the chip chips are
produced by a process known as  photolithography or optical  lithography  which
consists of shining a light  through a photomask a template on which the design
has been  drawn  onto  the  surface  of the  semiconductor  beginning  at 018
microns  the  wavelength of light used is larger than the features on the chip
resulting in degraded image quality  a number of eda products help address this
and other manufacturability issues

    designer productivity historically finding hiring and retaining qualified
design engineers has been one of the most difficult  problems that our customers
face  without enough  designers it is difficult for a company to meet ambitious

                                       3

development  schedules  and to get its  products to market in a timely  manner
although  hiring  qualified  designers has become less  difficult in the current
economic environment the increase in ic complexity and time to market pressures
have  resulted  in a  continuing  emphasis  on  designer  productivity  for eda
companies   this  creates   opportunities  both  in  providing   fullfeatured
integrated  design flows  that reduce the number of iterations  required during
the design process and in offering predesigned  preverified design building
blocks that can be reused in multiple designs

strategy

    synopsys  strategy  is to develop  and offer to its  customers  a broad and
integrated array of tools and services required to enable design of complex ics
especially  systemonachip  ics  the  company is seeking to build and enhance
products that help customers  address the most pressing problems of ic design at
013  micron  and  below   timing  closure   signal   integrity  and  closure
verification  designer productivity and design for  manufacturability  to that
end synopsys has organized its products into two distinct product platforms 
a design  implementation  platform and a design verification  platform  the
design implementation platform includes all of the products required to design a
chip from concept down to the handoff from the designer to the manufacturer the
design implementation  platform incorporates  synopsys  intellectual  property
logic design physical design design analysis timing analysis and design rule
checking products  many of these individual products or point tools are the
leading  products in their  category  synopsys  strategy is to integrate these
products  tightly  together  through the use of a common  database  and a common
timing engine  among other things and to develop new products that incorporate
technologies from multiple products  the design verification  platform includes
products  required  to verify the  functionality  of a chip at each phase of the
design  at the system rtl gate and transistor levels many of the point tools
in the  verification  platform are also the leading  products in their category

products

    synopsys  products  and  services  are  focused  on the  principal  needs of
semiconductor  designers  and at a business  level  are divided  into the four
categories  specified  above    ic  implementation  verification  nanometer
analysis and test and  intellectual  property  and  professional  services  the
products  and  services  included  in  these  categories  are  discussed  below
financial  information  regarding  synopsys  products  and services is included
under item 7  managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations  results of operations  revenue  product groups

ic implementation products

    synopsys ic  implementation  products  include most of the products used in
the logic  synthesis  and physical  design  phases of ic design  including  the
companys logic synthesis physical synthesis design planning place and route
extraction and reliability  analysis  products  the companys ic implementation
products include the largest proportion of the products acquired from avant

    historically   the  key  technologies  for  ic  implementation  were  logic
synthesis  and  placeandroute  logic  synthesis  is the  process  by  which a
highlevel  description  of desired  chip  functions  is mapped into a connected
collection  of logic gates and other  circuit  elements that perform the desired
functions  place and route is the  process  by which an ic  designer  takes the
logical description of an ic design created by design compiler and translates it
into a physical design

    design  compilertm is the marketleading  logic synthesis tool and is used
by a broad range of  companies  engaged in the design of ics to  optimize  their
designs for performance and area design compiler was introduced in 1988 and has
been updated  regularly since then  design  compiler 2002 features  significant
enhancements   including  improved  optimization   algorithms   runtimes  and
capacity design compiler expert is the companys basic logic synthesis product
customers  seeking  additional  features can purchase the  higherpriced  design
compiler  ultra  an upgrade path from design compiler expert to design compiler
ultra is also available

    design   compiler  has  become  a  cornerstone   of  ic  designers   design
methodology  and the company  expects that it will  continue to be an important
element in designers  overall suite of design tools  especially for performing
logic synthesis on nontimingcritical  portions of a design as the size of the
transistors  on a chip shrink and the number of  transistors on a chip increase
however  designers are increasingly faced with problems that are best addressed
by physical  design  tools  or by physical  synthesis  products  which combine

                                       5

elements of logic and physical design  consequently  the company believes that
its orders and revenue from design compiler  peaked in fiscal year 2001  orders
for this product as a percentage of synopsys  orders declined from 29 to 18 in
2001 and 2002 respectively  and may decline further

    the  company  released  its  first  physical  synthesis  product   physical
compiler in fiscal 2000 physical compiler unites logic synthesis and placement
functionality  and was  designed to  addresses  the  critical  timing  problems
encountered in designing advanced ics and systemsonachip prior to the avant
merger   the  company  was  developing  routing  and  related  physical  design
technologies  and its route compiler and clock tree compiler  products had been
released to beta  customers  the company also offered  separate point tools for
physical analysis  arcadia  top level routing  flexroute and floor planning
chip  architect  and  floorplan  compiler  our  strategy  was  to  transition
customers from design compiler to physical compiler and to introduce  additional
physical  design  products   integrated  with  physical  compiler  that  enabled
customers  to more  efficiently  complete  the design of their  systemonachip
products

    in the merger with  avant  the  company  acquired  avants  full suite of
physical  design  products  including the place and route  products  apollo and
astro avants successor  placeandroute  product the floor planning product
jupiter the analysis product star rc the reliability testing product mars rail
and the chip finishing product saturn based on a full technical evaluation  we
have decided to base the physical  synthesis and physical design portions of our
implementation  platform on  physical  compiler  and astro  during 2002 we made
progress on  integrating  these  products  while  beginning  development of new
products that unify logic and physical design route compiler is no longer being
sold to customers and we are  determining  how to integrate some of its features
into astro with respect to other products containing overlapping functions  we
determined  the  products  on which to focus our  efforts  and began  developing
smooth transition paths to these products for our customers

    most of the  products  acquired  from avant  shared  data  through a common
proprietary  database  known as milkyway  milkyway  enables  these  products to
exchange  critical data  algorithms and language in a highly efficient  manner
the  milkyway  database   facilitates  faster  convergence  of  critical  design
properties  including  timing  area  power and signal  integrity  by  allowing
certain  point tools to  directly  access  critical  data  use of the  milkyway
database is a critical  element in the  integration  plan for the  synopsys  and
avant  products we are actively working on putting milkyway functionality into
the core  products of the  companys  implementation  platform  and expect this
project to be completed during fiscal 2003

    the  companys  ic  implementation  products  also include  logic  synthesis
products for field  programmable  gate arrays  fpgas and complex  programmable
logic devices cplds

verification products

    the  companys  verification  products  consist  of high  level  or  logic
simulation and  verification  products and system level design and  verification
tools  these  products  enable ic designers to quickly and reliably  verify the
behavior of a design before it is committed to the expensive and  timeconsuming
process of gate level design and ic  fabrication  and also assist in the testing
of the chip after manufacturing

    simulation  and related  products  simulation  software  exercises  an ic
design by running it through a series of tests and comparing the actual  outputs
from the design with the expected output the goal of simulation is to make sure
that the  functionality of the design meets the original  specifications  of the
chip  synopsys  offers two products for  highlevel  simulation  vcstm  for
designs   written  in  verilog  one  of  the  two  principal   languages   and
sciroccotm  for  designs  written  in vhdl the  other  principal  language
simulation products are distinguished  principally by their runtime and capacity
 ie  how fast they can fully  simulate  a  proposed  design and how large a
design  they can  handle  the company is focused on  providing  the  industrys
fastest and  highestcapacity  simulation  technology and believes that both vcs
and scirocco are industry leaders in performance and capacity  vcs is supported
by all major  semiconductor  manufacturers  and many  thirdparty  eda  software
providers  vcs 70 which is expected to be released  during the first calendar
quarter of 2003 will increase vcs capabilities by integrating  significant new
functionality  including advanced assertion verification  testbench capability


                                       6

and next generation  coverage  these  capabilities are integrated into a single
open  platform  that  is  also  highly   automated   which  improves   designer
productivity

    in  addition to focusing  on  building  the fastest  simulator  synopsys is
focused on  developing a suite of products  that help  simulation  products work
smarter  the company  estimates  that ic  designers  spend more time  writing
verification  testbenches than creating the design  description  testbenches
which create  stimuli for chips and check the results  are used in  conjunction
with simulation tools to verify that a design  functions as expected  synopsys
verar is a tool that automates the design of testbenches thereby offering the
ic designer significant reductions in overall design and verification time vera
is integrated with the companys other simulation  products to provide increased
productivity   benefits   in  addition   synopsys  acquisition  of  codesign
automation  inc  provides the company with next generation  hardware  language
verification technology that will be used in future releases of its verification
products  synopsys  has  bundled  verification  tools  such as vcs and  vera to
provide  a  comprehensive  verification  environment  for  its  customers  with
particular emphasis on mixed signal analog and digital chip verification

    systems  design  and  verification  products  currently  automated  design
generally begins at the register transfer level with logic synthesis  the goal
of  systemlevel  products is to permit  designers  to design and verify their
products at a level of abstraction above rtl synopsys systems products consist
of the cocentrictm  family of tools and  methodologies for concurrent  design
validation refinement and implementation of an electronic system

    the  company  offers  two  principal  products  based on  systemc  tm a
standard  language  developed by synopsys and now available under an open source
license  systemc enables  designers to create  validate and share system level
models of a complex ic or system  incorporating  the chip  and therefore can be
used to explore and verify design  alternatives  at an early stage of the design
process  cocentric system studio is a systemlevel  design  environment for the
rapid  creation of  executable  system  specifications  that can be verified and
implemented as hardware and software functions  system studio enables designers
to use hierarchical graphical and language modeling to capture system complexity
in a unified environment based on c c and systemc cocentric systemc compiler
is a synthesis  tool that allows  designers to implement  complex  circuits from
systemc   enabling  design  to  progress  from  an  initial  cc   executable
specification into a database readable by synopsys design compiler

    through the  acquisition  of avant  synopsys  acquired its saber  product
which  offers  mixed  signal  system  level  design  tools for the power  test
automotive telecommunications and militaryaerospace markets

nanometer analysis and test products

    synopsys  nanometer  analysis and test  products  include a broad range of
software  tools in the areas of physical  verification  timing  analysis  gate
level circuit  simulation  power  management  and parasitic  extraction  these
products which are used after the completion of physical design help customers
analyze the increasingly  important  electrical effects resulting from designing
at 018 micron and below and to locate implementation errors that can be costly
and  timeconsuming  to  correct  during or after  production  as the logic and
physical design phases of ic implementation  grow more and more integrated  the
company is also  integrating  many of its nanometer  analysis and test products
with  its  high  level  verification  products  particularly  in the  areas  of
simulation timing and power analysis

    static  timing  analysis  synopsys  provides a complete  tool suite to help
designers  perform static timing analysis at the gate and transistor  levels and
analyze  signal  integrity  issues  such as cross  talk  synopsys  gate  level
analysis  tool is called  primetimer  primetime  is a  fullchip  gatelevel
static  timing  analysis tool  targeted for complex  multimillion  gate designs
which is used by designers to verify  at various stages of the design  process
the speed at which a design  will  operate  when it is  fabricated  primetimes
analysis of a designs  speed is accepted as a sign off tool by virtually  all
major semiconductor manufacturers  which means that they accept its analysis as
determinative  in fiscal 2001 synopsys extended primetimes  capabilities with

plus extends pathmill to offer advanced modeling model merging and verification
to speed  characterization of custom ip blocks the combination of primetime and
pathmill  offers  fullchip  static timing  analysis that covers  transistor to
gatelevel designs

    formal  verification  formal  verification  is a method for  comparing  two
versions of a design to determine if they are equivalent usually an rtl version
of the design is  validated  using  simulation  and other  dynamic  verification
tools  establishing it as the golden version  subsequent versions ie after
each step of the design process are then compared to the golden version  using
mathematical algorithms  to determine if they are functionally equivalent  the
use of formal verification greatly reduces the need to perform simulation which
is substantially more timeconsuming  at each stage of the design process thus
potentially  saving a significant  amount of time in the overall design process
synopsys formal verification product is formalityr  formality was one of the
industrys  first  commercial  equivalency  checkers  to  employ a  multisolver
architecture  which  enables  the  verification  of  complex  multimilliongate
systemonachip designs in days or minutes

     circuit  simulation  while synopsys high level verification tools such as
vcs simulate an ic design at a logical or higher level of abstraction synopsys
circuit simulation products perform simulation at the gate and transistor level
these products  include the taurus and hspice tools  acquired in the avant  and
the nanosim product  which synopsys  introduced during fiscal 2001 taurus is a
tcad tool used for new  process  simulation  at  semiconductor  foundaries  the
hspice product is a highly  accurate  circuit  simulation  tool used to simulate
designs at transistor level nanosim is an advanced circuit simulator for memory

transistorlevels  and enable mixedsignal  multilevel verification of complex
ics in addition through the acquisition of starsim and starsim xt from avant
synopsys suite of circuit  simulation tools has expanded to include  simulators
for  nanometerlevel  processes  and  applications  such  as  graphics  memory
communications  and  mixedsignal ic designs  synopsys is offering  customers a
smooth  migration  path from starsim and starsim xt to nanosim while adding some
of the key features from starsim into nanosim

    power  management  synopsys  delivers a complete solution to help designers
manage and verify power  consumption at different  levels of the design process
based   principally  on  power  compiler   which  offers  push  button  power
optimization  and is fully integrated into the design compiler  environment  in
addition  through the acquisition of starmtb from avant  synopsys extends its
solution in this area by offering library characterization capability with power

    physical  verification  synopsys offers classleading physical verification
products that provide  geometric and electrical  verification of physical design
layouts in  designs  containing  hundreds  of  millions  of  transistors  these
products verify a design at the gate level rather than at the higher  rtl level
of  abstraction  synopsys  physical  verification  product  family  is  called
hercules

    design for  manufacturing  synopsys markets products for optical proximity
correction  circuit packaging and final design validation used in order to help
ensure the final ic design will be manufacturable by the semiconductor  foundry
synopsys opc product family is called  proteus  in addition  in january 2003
synopsys entered into an agreement to acquire  numerical  technologies  inc a
developer of subwavelength  lithography solutions  this acquisition is expected
to complement synopsys existing design for manufacturing tools

intellectual property ip and systems level design

     the  companys ip products  include our  designware  ip library and systems
design and  verification  products  as well as the  physical  library  products
acquired from avant  synopsys also offers a full range of professional services
to help customers improve their internal design methodologies as well as design
services ranging from specialized assistance to turnkey design

    intellectual  property  products  as ic designs  continue  to grow in size
reusing design blocks is becoming a more important  method for reducing  overall
design cycle time by reusing portions of a design  and particularly those that
implement basic or standardized  functions a company can let its ic design team
focus on designing  the chip  features  that will give its product a competitive
advantage  it can also  reduce its  verification  risk by  ensuring  that these
portions  of the  chip  are of high  quality  enabling  reuse  of  intellectual
property ip  requires a  significant  methodology  shift from  traditional  ic
design in the past designs were intimately tied to a particular  semiconductor
process technology or design methodology making reuse of design blocks from one
chip design to the next both difficult and costly

    synopsys  designwarer library products provide ic designers with a single
library of predesigned and preverified  synthesizable ip cores as well as over
22500 verification ip models both groups of cores range in complexity from the
simple to the very complex  giving  designers access to a broad range of models
to  assist  them with  verification  of their  designs  during  2002  synopsys
introduced a complete amba onchipbus to designware  providing  designers with
access to the most popular bus architecture  for designers using  microprocessor
cores from third party vendors

    through the acquisition of insilicon corporation in september 2002 synopsys
expanded its offering of  standardsbased  connectivity  ip to include usb ieee
1394  80211  and other  products  these  cores  are sold on a peruse  basis
sometimes with a royalty based on the number of chips  produced  rather than as
perpetual  licenses or technology  subscription  licenses tsls  as designware
foundation  libraries are sold  the company  expects to expand its inventory of
cores sold on a per use basis during 2003

    in 2001 synopsys announced its star ip program in which designware users can
gain  access  to  popular  microprocessors  from  mips  technologies   infineon

months which have not been shipped  orders for customer training and consulting
services which are expected to be completed  within one year  and  subscription
services  maintenance and support with contract periods extending up to fifteen
months  in the case of a tsl backlog includes the full amount of the committed
noncancelable  order  less any amount of revenue that has been  recognized  on
such tsl

    the company has not historically  experienced  significant  cancellations of
orders   customers  frequently  reschedule  or  revise  the  requested  service
performance  dates for  service  orders  however  which can have the effect of
deferring  recognition  of service  revenue for these orders beyond the expected
time period

research and development

    the  companys  future  performance  depends in large part on its ability to
maintain and enhance its current product lines  develop new products  maintain
technological   competitiveness   and  meet  an  expanding   range  of  customer
requirements  in addition to research  and  development  conducted  within each
business  unit  the  company  maintains  an  advanced  research  group  that is
responsible   for  exploring  new  directions  and   applications  of  its  core
technologies  migrating new  technologies  into the existing  product lines and
maintaining  strong  research  relationships  outside  the  company  within both
industry and academia

    during fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 research and development expenses net of
capitalized software development costs were 2255 million  1898 million and
1893 million respectively synopsys capitalized software development costs of
approximately  16 million  10 million and 10 million in fiscal 2002 2001
and 2000 respectively  the company anticipates that it will continue to commit

and  shipping  its system and  software  products  and  documentation  needed to
fulfill each order  manufacturing  is currently  coordinated  through  contract
vendors  located near synopsys  mountain view  california and dublin  ireland
facilities  the contract vendors provide the majority of cdrom replication and
ondemand printing and distribution of product media and documentation synopsys
delivers an increasing  proportion of its software  products by electronic means
rather than by shipping  disks  when  specified  by the customer or required by
law synopsys delivers disks to the customers site synopsys typically delivers
its software  products within 10 days of acceptance of customer  purchase orders
and execution of software license  agreements  unless the customer has requested
otherwise

competition

    the eda  industry  is  highly  competitive  we  compete  against  other eda
vendors  and with  customers  internally  developed  design tools and internal
design  capabilities  for a share of the overall  eda  budgets of our  potential
customers  in general  competition  is based on product  quality and features
postsale support interoperability with other vendors products price payment
terms and as discussed  below the ability to offer a complete design flow our
competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services
such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation as well as
companies  that offer  products  focused on a discrete  phase of the  integrated
circuit design process in the current economic  environment  price and payment
terms have  increased in  importance as a basis for  competition  during fiscal
2002 we have  increasingly  agreed to extended payment terms on our tsls which
has had a negative effect on cash flow from operations  in addition in certain
situations our competitors are offering aggressive  discounts on their products
as a result average prices may fall


                                       12
page

     increasingly  eda companies compete on the basis of design flows involving
integrated  logic  and  physical  design  products  rather  than on the basis of
individual  point tools  performing a discrete phase of the design process  the
need to offer an integrated  design flow will become  increasingly  important as
ics grow more  complex  after the  acquisition  of avant  we offer all of the
point tools required to design an ic some of which integrate logic and physical
design capabilities  our products compete principally with design flow products
from cadence and magma  design  automation  which in some  respects may be more
integrated  than our  products  our future  success  depends on our  ability to
integrate  synopsys  logic  design and  physical  synthesis  products  with the
physical design products  acquired from avant  which will require  significant
engineering  and  development  work  success  in  this  project  is  especially
important  as the  company  believes  that its orders and  revenue  from  design
compiler  which has  accounted  for 29 and 18 of synopsys  orders in 2001 and
2002  respectively peaked in fiscal year 2001 as predicted  and are likely to
continue to decline over time there can be no guarantee that we will be able to
offer a competitive complete design flow to customers if we are unsuccessful in
developing  integrated  design  flow  products  on a  timely  basis or if we are
unsuccessful in developing or convincing  customers to adopt such products  our
competitive position could be significantly weakened

    in order to  sustain  revenue  growth  over the long  term  we will have to
enhance our existing  products  introduce  new products  that are accepted by a
broad range of  customers  and to  generate  growth in our  consulting  services
business in addition to the development of integrated logic and physical design
products  synopsys is attempting to integrate its verification  products into a
comprehensive  functional  verification platform and is expanding its offerings
of  intellectual  property  design  components  product success is difficult to
predict  the  introduction  of new  products  and  growth of a market  for such
products cannot be assured in the past we like all companies  have introduced
new products that have failed to meet our revenue expectations  there can be no
assurance  that we will be successful in expanding  revenue from existing or new
products  at the  desired  rate  and the failure to do so would have a material
adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

product sales and licensing agreements

    synopsys  typically  licenses its software to customers under  nonexclusive
license  agreements  that transfer title to the media only and that restrict use
of the software to specified purposes within specified  geographical  areas the
company  currently  licenses the  majority of its software as a network  license
that  allows a number of  individual  users to access the  software on a defined
network  license  fees are  dependent  on the type of license  product mix and
number of copies of each product licensed

    synopsys  currently  offers its software  products  under either a perpetual
license or a tsl under a perpetual  license a customer pays a onetime  license
fee for the right to use the  software  the vast  majority of customers  buying
perpetual  licenses also purchase annual software support services  under which
they receive minor  enhancements to the products  developed during the year bug
fixes and technical assistance  during the past two years a number of customers
have  discontinued  software support on perpetual  licenses  see  managements

results of operations  revenue  a tsl operates like a rental of software and
includes  software  support services for the tsl term a customer pays a fee for
license  and  support  over a fixed  period of time  and at the end of the time
period the license  expires  unless the  customer  pays for a renewal  tsls are
offered  with a range of terms  the average  length of tsls sold during  fiscal
2002 was approximately  33 years see managements  discussion and analysis of
financial  condition  and  results of  operations   results of  operations  
revenue

    during  fiscal  2002  orders for tsls  accounted  for 73 of total  product
orders compared to 80 in fiscal 2001

     during fiscal 2003  synopsys has  established a target for ratable license
orders as a proportion of total  license  orders of between 73 and 78 and for
perpetual  license orders as a proportion of total product orders of between 22
to 27 this range may be subject to change in market conditions during the year

proprietary rights

    the  company  primarily  relies upon a  combination  of  copyright  patent
trademark  and trade  secret laws and license and  nondisclosure  agreements  to
establish and protect  proprietary  rights in its products  the source code for
synopsys  products is protected  both as a trade  secret and as an  unpublished

included in its products and will continue to pursue  additional  patents in the
future

    although  the  company  believes  that its  products  trademarks  and other
proprietary  rights do not infringe on the proprietary  rights of third parties
there can be no assurance that infringement  claims will not be asserted against
the  company in the future or that any such  claims will not require the company
to enter  into  royalty  arrangements  or result in  costly  and  timeconsuming
litigation

employees

    as of november 2 2002  synopsys  had a total of 4254  employees  of whom
2849 were based in north america and 1405 were based outside of north america
synopsys future financial  results depend  in part upon the continued service
of its key technical and senior management  personnel and its continuing ability
to attract and retain  highly  qualified  technical  and  managerial  personnel
competition for such personnel is intense our success is dependent on technical
and other contributions of key employees  we participate in a dynamic industry
with significant  startup activity  and our headquarters is in silicon valley
where  skilled  technical  sales and  management  employees are in high demand
there are a limited  number of qualified  eda and ic design  engineers  and the
competition  for such  individuals is intense  experience at synopsys is highly
valued  in the  eda  industry  and the  general  electronics  industry  and our
employees  are  recruited  aggressively  by  our  competitors  and  by  startup
companies in many industries in the past we have experienced and may continue
to experience  significant  employee  turnover  there can be no assurance that
synopsys can retain its key  managerial  and technical  employees or that it can
attract  assimilate or retain other highly  qualified  technical and managerial
personnel in the future  none of synopsys  employees is represented by a labor
union  synopsys  has not  experienced  any work  stoppages  and  considers  its
relations with its employees to be good

item 3 legal proceedings

avant litigation

     avant  which  upon  completion  of the  synopsysavant  merger  became a
whollyowned  subsidiary of synopsys  is or was a party to a number of material
civil litigation matters

     on november 13 2002  synopsys entered into a settlement  agreement by and
among synopsys  cadence design systems  inc  avant  corporation llc and the
individuals named in the litigation entitled cadence design systems inc et al
v  avant  corporation  et al  pursuant  to  which  cadence  avant  and such
individuals  agreed to dismiss  all  pending  claims and  counterclaims  in such
litigation  and to  release  all  claims  they  made or could  have  made in the
litigation  under the  agreement  cadence  has been paid 265  million and the
litigation has been dismissed by all parties in addition  under the settlement
agreement cadence avant and synopsys as the acquirer of avant have granted
each other reciprocal  licenses  covering the intellectual  property that was at
issue in the litigation

     the payment was made by illinois national  insurance  company a subsidiary
of the  american  international  group  aig  insurer for  synopsys  under an
insurance policy purchased by synopsys upon the completion of its acquisition of
avant

     as a result of the payment synopsys recorded expense in the fourth quarter
of its fiscal year 2002 of approximately  2408 million  which is equal to the
contingently refundable portion of the insurance premium recorded as a longterm
restricted  asset on the companys  balance  sheet plus  interest  earned on the
restricted  asset  the expense and the  reversal  of the  restricted  asset are
reflected in the  financial  statements  included in this annual  report on form
10k see note 3 of notes to synopsys consolidated financial statements

     prior to the merger  avant  leased five buildings in fremont  california
for its headquarters after the merger the functions performed in the buildings
were consolidated  into synopsys  mountain view and sunnyvale  facilities  the
fremont buildings were closed and avant  stopped paying rent on the underlying
leases in november 2002  synopsys settled all claims of the landlord of two of
the  buildings  the other three  buildings  located at 46859  46871 and 46897
bayside  parkway  and owned by renco  investment  company  are the  subject  of
litigation  as of october 31  2002  synopsys  maintained  an accrual of 542
million with respect to closure of these three buildings synopsys believes that
the amount  accrued will be  sufficient  to satisfy any current or future claims
relating to former avant  facilities  but cannot assure stockholders that this
will be the case

     on  february  7 2002 renco  filed suit in alameda  county  superior  court
claiming  damages  against  avant  on account of  rejection of the lease on the
premises at 46897  bayside  parkway by  comdisco  inc  comdisco  occupied  the
premises  pursuant to an assignment  dated september 14 2000 between avant and
comdisco  comdisco  filed  chapter 11  bankruptcy in july 2001 and rejected the
lease in the  bankruptcy  proceeding in september  2001  renco is alleging that
under the  assignment  avant  remained  obligated  to pay rent and common area
maintenance  charges on its underlying  lease with renco  renco is arguing that
the assignment  documentation  obligated avant to guarantee  rencos portion of
the additional rent to be owed by comdisco accordingly  rencos complaint asks
for rent damages in the sum of  approximately  372  million and  approximately
59 million in build out damages  avant is vigorously defending these claims
though no assurances can be given regarding the outcome of the litigation or the
amount that avant  may ultimately be required to pay to renco the court in the
comdisco  bankruptcy  proceeding has reserved 62 million in aggregate for rent
payable to renco or avant  there is no  assurance  that avant  and renco will
ultimately  be able to collect such amount in such  proceeding  but the reserve
acts as a cap on their collective recovery from comdisco

     renco  has  declared  a  default  on the  avant  leases on 46859 and 46871
bayside  parkway  based on the  crossdefault  provisions in those leases and in
november 2002 renco filed suit to recover unpaid rent on those buildings

     on august 10 2001  silicon  valley  research  inc svr filed an action
against avant in the united states district court for the northern  district of
california  the  complaint  purports  to  state  claims  for  statutory  unfair
competition receipt sale and concealment of stolen property interference with
prospective economic advantage conspiracy false advertising  violation of the
lanham act and violation of 18 usca  ss 1962 rico  in the complaint
svr alleges that avants use of cadence  trade secrets  damaged svr by allowing
avant  to develop and market  products  more  quickly and cheaply than it could
have  otherwise  the  complaint  seeks  an  accounting  the  imposition  of  a
constructive  trust  and actual and exemplary  damages  in september 2002 the
court granted motions to dismiss filed by avant  and  codefendant  stephen wuu
and in october 2002 svr filed an amended complaint  substantially repeating its
prior claims  avant  has moved to dismiss the complaint and each of the claims
and each of the codefendants  has joined that motion  the motion to dismiss is
currently scheduled to be heard in february 2003

     avant  believes  it has  defenses  to svrs  claims and  intends to defend
itself  vigorously  these defenses  include  but are not limited to  defenses
based on the authority granted to avant by the written release agreement signed
between  cadence  and  avant  in 1994 and the  settlement  agreement  signed in
november 2002  avants denial of any postrelease  misappropriation of cadence
trade secrets  avants  belief that any use by avant of cadence trade secrets
did not confer any competitive advantage on avant over svr and avants belief
that svrs loss of market  share  resulted  from  factors  other than any use by
avant of cadence trade secrets  should svrs claims succeed  however  avant
could be  required  to pay  monetary  damages  to svr  accordingly  an adverse
judgment could seriously harm avants business  financial position and results
of operations

     between july and october 2001 three derivative  actions were filed against
avant and certain of its officers and directors  scott v muraki  et al no
01017548 cal superior ct louisiana school employees  retirement system v
muraki et al ca no 19091 del chancery ct and peterson v hsu et al
ca no 19178 del  chancery  ct  the actions  allege  in substance  that
certain present and former avant officers and directors caused damage to avant
by misappropriating trade secrets from competitors making false representations
to investors and the public  and causing avant to award  lucrative  employment
contracts  bonuses  stock option grants and valuable consulting contracts and
ownership  interests in companies  affiliated with avant  the louisiana school
employees  retirement  system case was dismissed in august 2002 also in august
2002  the  plaintiffs  in the  remaining  actions  have agreed to a  settlement
involving payment of attorneys fees only for the plaintiffs

     other litigation

     in july 2001  synopsys  entered into an agreement to acquire ikos systems
inc in december 2001 mentor graphics  inc mentor  submitted an unsolicited
offer to acquire ikos and in connection therewith filed a lawsuit in the court
of chancery of the state of delaware  ca no 19299 against ikos the members
of ikos  board of  directors  synopsys  and  synopsys  subsidiary  oak merger
corporation oak the lawsuit claimed that certain provisions of the synopsys
 ikos merger agreement merger agreement were entered into in breach of the
ikos directors  fiduciary  duties  and that synopsys and oak aided and abetted
those breaches  a second lawsuit was filed by an alleged shareholder of ikos on
essentially  the same grounds  in march 2002  synopsys and ikos entered into a
termination  agreement by which they  mutually  agreed to  terminate  the merger
agreement subsequently mentor acquired ikos as a result the company believes
this suit to be moot and  expects  it to be  dismissed  during the first half of
2003 a third  lawsuit  relating to this matter  filed in  california  superior
court in santa clara county  california was dismissed with prejudice in august
2002

     there are no other material legal  proceedings  pending against the company

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

    the following  discussion  contains  forwardlooking  statements  within the
meaning of section 21e of the  securities  exchange  act of 1934  for  example
statements   including   terms  such  as  projects   expects   believes
anticipates or targets are forwardlooking statements  actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in such forwardlooking statements as a
result of certain  factors  including  those set forth under  factors that may
affect future results

critical accounting policies

    the  discussion  and  analysis  of our  financial  condition  and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make  estimates  and  judgments  that affect the reported  amounts of assets
liabilities  revenues and expenses and related  disclosure of contingent assets
and  liabilities  on an ongoing  basis  we evaluate our estimates  including
those related to revenue recognition bad debts investments  intangible assets
and income  taxes  our  estimates  are based on  historical  experience  and on
various other  assumptions  we believe are reasonable  under the  circumstances
actual results may differ from these estimates

    the  accounting  policies  described  below are those  that most  frequently
require us to make  estimates  and  judgments  and are  therefore  critical  to
understanding our results of operations

    revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note 2 of
the notes to consolidated financial statements  management has made significant
judgments related to revenue recognition  specifically in connection with each
transaction  involving  our  products  referred to as an  arrangement  in the
accounting   literature  we  must  evaluate   whether  our  fee  is  fixed  or
determinable  and we must assess whether  collectibility  is probable  these
judgments are discussed below

    the fee is fixed or determinable  with respect to each arrangement we must
make a judgment as to whether the arrangement fee is fixed or  determinable  if
the fee is fixed or  determinable  then revenue is recognized  upon delivery of
software  assuming other revenue  recognition  criteria are met if the fee is
not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each quarter subject
to application of other revenue recognition  criteria will be the lesser of the
aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the  arrangement  fee that
would have been recognized if the fees had been fixed or determinable

    except  in cases  where  we  grant  extended  payment  terms  to a  specific
customer  we have  determined  that our fees are fixed or  determinable  at the
inception of our arrangements based on the following

o        the fee our  customers pay for our products is negotiated at the outset
         of an  arrangement  and is generally  based on the  specific  volume of
         products to be delivered

o        our license fees are not a function of variablepricing mechanisms such
         as the number of units  distributed  or copied by the  customer  or the
         expected number of users of the product delivered


                                       19
page

     a  determination  that an  arrangement  fee is fixed or  determinable  also
depends upon the payment terms  relating to such an  arrangement  our customary
payment terms  supported by historical practice  require that a minimum of 75
of the arrangement fee is due within one year or less arrangements with payment
terms  extending  beyond the customary  payment terms are  considered  not to be
fixed or  determinable  a determination of whether the arrangement fee is fixed
or  determinable is  particularly  relevant to revenue  recognition on perpetual
licenses

     collectibility is probable  in order to recognize revenue  we must make a
judgment of the  collectibility  of the  arrangement  fee  our  judgment of the
collectibility is applied on a customerbycustomer basis pursuant to our credit
review  policy  we typically  sell to customers for which there is a history of
successful  collection  new customers are subjected to a credit review process
which  evaluates  the  customers  financial  positions  and ability to pay new
customers are typically  assigned a credit limit based on a formulated review of
their  financial  position  such  credit  limits  are  only  increased  after a
successful  collection history with the customer has been established  if it is
determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable
based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cashcollected
basis

    valuation of  strategic  investments  as of october 31 2002  the adjusted
cost of our strategic  investments totaled 251 million  excluding  unrealized
gains and  losses  we review  our  investments  in  nonpublic  companies  on a
quarterly  basis and estimate the amount of any impairment  incurred  during the
current period based on specific  analysis of each  investment  considering the
activities of and events occurring at each of the underlying portfolio companies
during the quarter  our  portfolio  companies  operate in  industries  that are
rapidly evolving and extremely competitive for equity investments in nonpublic
companies  where  there  is  not a  market  in  which  their  value  is  readily
determinable  we assess each  investment  for  indicators of impairment at each
quarter end based  primarily on  achievement  of business  plan  objectives  and
current market conditions  among other factors and information available to us
at the time of this quarterly  assessment  the primary business plan objectives
we consider  include  achievement of planned  financial  results  completion of
capital  raising  activities  the  launching of  technology  the hiring of key
employees and overall progress on the portfolio  companys  business plan if it
is determined that an impairment has occurred with respect to an investment in a
portfolio company in the absence of quantitative valuation metrics  management
estimates  the  impairment  andor  the net  realizable  value of the  portfolio
investment based on public and  privatecompany  market comparable  information
and valuations completed for companies similar to our portfolio companies based
on these measurements impairment losses aggregating 113 million were recorded
during fiscal 2002 future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating
results of  underlying  investments  and other  information  obtained  after our
quarterly  assessment  could  result in  additional  losses or an  inability  to
recover  the  current  carrying  value of the  investments  thereby  requiring a
further impairment charge in the future

    valuation  of  intangible  assets  intangible  assets  net of  accumulated
amortization  totaled  3553  million as of october 31 2002 we  periodically
evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment  whenever events or
changes  in   circumstances   indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  not  be
recoverable  intangible  assets  consist  of  goodwill  purchased  technology
contract  rights   intangibles  as  defined  under  results  of  operations  
acquisition  of avant  corporation   contract  rights  intangible  customer
installed  baserelationship   trademarks  and  tradenames  covenants  not  to
compete  customer  backlog  and  capitalized  software   factors  we  consider
important  which  could  trigger  an  impairment   review  include   significant
underperformance  relative to expected historical or projected future operating
results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or
the  strategy  for our overall  business  or  significant  negative  industry or
economic trends  if this evaluation  indicates that the value of the intangible
asset may be impaired  an assessment of the  recoverability of the net carrying
value of the asset over its remaining  useful life is made  if this  assessment
indicates that the intangible asset is not  recoverable  based on the estimated
undiscounted  future cash flows of the entity or  technology  acquired  over the
remaining  amortization period the net carrying value of the related intangible
asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be
adjusted  any such  impairment  charge  could be  significant  and could have a
material  adverse effect on our reported  financial  statements  based on these
measurements  we recorded an impairment  charge of  approximately  01 million
during  fiscal  2002 and an  impairment  charge of 37  million  related to the
avant merger as described under integration costs below

     allowance for doubtful accounts  as of october 31 2002 our allowance for
doubtful accounts totaled 116 million management estimates the collectibility
of our accounts  receivable  on an  accountbyaccount  basis  in addition  we
provide  for a general  reserve on all  accounts  receivable  using a specified
percentage  of  the   outstanding   balance  in  each  aged  group   management
specifically  analyzes  accounts  receivable and historical bad debt experience

such as currency  devaluation  and changes in our customer payment terms when
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial
condition of our customers  were to  deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of
their ability to make payments  additional  allowances may be required  during
the current year  writeoffs  net of  recoveries  and  additional  allowances
totaled 65 million and 70 million respectively

     income taxes  our effective tax rate is directly  affected by the relative
proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income  we are also subject
to changing tax laws in the multiple  jurisdictions  in which we operate  as of
october 31 2002 deferred tax assets and liabilities totaled 3822 million and
1059  million  respectively  we believe that it is more likely than not that
the results of future  operations  will generate  sufficient  taxable  income to
utilize these net deferred tax assets  while we have considered  future taxable
income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the
need for any valuation allowance  should we determine that we would not be able
to  realize  all or  part of our net  deferred  tax  assets  in the  future  an
adjustment  to the  deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period
such determination was made

results of operations

    mergers and  acquisitions  on june 6 2002  we  completed  our merger with
avant  avant was a leader in the development of software used in the physical
design  and  physical  verification  phases of chip  design  as a result of the
merger  we are now able to offer a  comprehensive  array  of  products  for the
design  and  verification  of chips  products  obtained  in the  merger are key
components of the  implementation  and verification  platforms  discussed above
under the terms of the merger  agreement  between  synopsys  and avant  avant
merged with and into a whollyowned subsidiary of synopsys the aggregate merger
consideration  including the fair value of stock issued was approximately 10
billion  and was determined  primarily as a result of competitive  bidding with
other potential  acquirors  as a result of the merger  we recorded goodwill of
3695  million  which is reflected  on the  consolidated  balance  sheet as of
october  31  2002  we believe  that the value of the  products  acquired  from
avant when combined with the premerger synopsys products justifies the price
paid  the results of  operations  of avant  are  included in the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements  for the  period  from june 6 2002  through
october 31 2002

    on september 6 2002 we completed our  acquisition of codesign  a private
company  which  was  developing  simulation  software  used  in the  high  level
verification  stage of the chip design  process  and a new design language that
permits  designers to describe the behavior of their chips more efficiently than
current standard languages the aggregate purchase price for codesign was 323
million  which was determined  principally by competitive  bidding with another
potential  acquiror  as a result of the merger we  recorded  goodwill  of 277
million  which is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of october 31
2002 we believe that we will derive a competitive  advantage through the use of
codesigns new design language in our design and verification  products and the
expertise of its employees and therefore the price is justified the results of
operations of codesign are included in the accompanying  consolidated financial
statements for the period from september 6 2002 through october 31 2002

    on september 20 2002 we completed our acquisition of insilicon  a company
that  developed  marketed  and  licensed  an  extensive  portfolio  of  complex
intellectual property blocks or predesigned  preverified  subportions of a
chip that can be used as  building  blocks for  complex  systemsonachip  and
therefore accelerate the development of such chips the aggregate purchase price
for insilicon was 746 million as a result of the merger we recorded goodwill
of 222  million  which is reflected on the  consolidated  balance  sheet as of
october 31 2002 we believe that the  combination of  insilicons  portfolio of
intellectual  property with our own portfolio will provide us with a competitive
advantage over other providers of intellectual  property  blocks  and therefore
justifies the price  the results of operations of insilicon are included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the period from the september
20 2002 through october 31 2002

    revenue  revenue consists of fees for perpetual and ratable licenses of our
software products  postcontract  customer support pcs customer training and
consulting we classify revenues as product service or ratable license product
revenue  consists  primarily of perpetual  software  licenses  service  revenue
consists of pcs under  perpetual  licenses and fees for consulting  services and
training ratable license revenue consists of all revenue from our tsls and from
timebased  licenses  sold  prior to the  adoption  of tsls in august  2000 that
include extended payment terms or unspecified additional products

     adoption of subscription licenses impact on revenue in the fourth quarter
of  fiscal  2000  we  introduced  a new  type of  license  called  a  technology
subscription  license  a tsl is a  license  to use one or more of our  software
products  and to receive support services such as hotline support and updates
for a limited  period of time  usually one to three  years  since tsls include
bundled  products and  services  both product and service  revenue is generally
recognized  ratably  over the term of the  license  or if later  as  payments
become due the terms of tsls  and the payments due thereon  may be structured
flexibly to meet the needs of the  customer  in certain  situations  customers
have limited  rights to new  technology  through  reconfiguration  clauses under
their agreements

    prior to the  adoption  of  tsls  we sold  perpetual  licenses  and  term
licenses a type of timebased license under these types of licenses software
support is  purchased  separately  revenue  from the license  sale is generally
recognized in the quarter that the product is shipped or upfront and revenue
from  software  support is  recognized  ratably  over the support  period  term
licenses were discontinued when tsls were introduced

    due to the different  treatment of tsls and  perpetualterm  licenses  under
applicable  accounting rules each type of license has a different impact on our
financial  statements  when a customer buys a tsl relatively little revenue is
recognized during the quarter the product is initially delivered  the remaining
amount not recognized will either be recorded as deferred revenue on our balance
sheet or  considered  backlog by us and not recorded on the balance  sheet  the
amount  recorded as deferred  revenue is equal to the portion of the license fee
that has been invoiced or paid but not recognized the amount considered backlog
moves out of backlog  and is  recorded  as  deferred  revenue as  invoiced or as
additional  payments  are made  deferred  revenue  is  reduced  as  revenue  is
recognized  under perpetual licenses and term licenses  a high proportion of
all license  revenue is recognized in the quarter that the product is delivered
with relatively little recorded as deferred revenue or as backlog therefore an
order for a tsl will result in significantly lower  currentperiod  revenue than
an equalsized order under the prior form of timebased licenses conversely an
order for a tsl will result in higher revenues recognized in future periods than
an equalsized  order for a perpetual or term license  for example  a 120000
order for a perpetual  license will result in 120000 of revenue  recognized in
the quarter the product is shipped and no revenue in future  quarters  the same
order for a 3year tsl shipped at the  beginning  of the quarter  will result in
10000 of revenue  recognized in the quarter the product is shipped and in each
of the 11 succeeding quarters

    on an aggregate  basis  the introduction of tsls has had and will continue
to have a significant  impact on our reported revenue and on our balance sheet
in the quarter  immediately  following  the adoption of tsls  reported  revenue
dropped  significantly  in each quarter  since  adoption  ratable  revenue has
grown  as tsl  orders  received  in each  quarter  contribute  revenue  that is
layered  over  the  revenue  recognized  from  tsl  orders  received  in prior
quarters  this effect will repeat itself each quarter in varying  degrees until
the tsl model is fully phased in during this transition  period ratable revenue
will continue to grow even if the overall level of tsl orders does not grow and
could grow even if the overall level of tsl orders declines the phase in period
of the tsl model is difficult  to predict  absent any  acquisitions  the model
would be substantially phased in approximately 325 years following the adoption
of the  model  the phase in period  has been  extended  by the  acquisition  of
avant and will be extended to some extent by any future  acquisitions we make
over the long  term  as the tsl model  becomes  more fully  phased in  average
revenue growth will closely track average orders growth

    synopsys  license revenue in any given quarter is dependent upon the volume
of  perpetual  orders  shipped  during the quarter and the amount of tsl revenue
amortized  from  deferred  revenue  recognized  out of backlog  and to a small
degree recognized on tsl orders received during the quarter we set our revenue
targets for any given period based  in part  upon an  assumption  that we will
achieve  a certain  level of  orders  and a  certain  license  mix of  perpetual
licenses  and  tsls  the  precise  mix of  orders  is  subject  to  substantial


                                       22
page


fluctuation in any given quarter or multiple quarter periods and the actual mix
of licenses  sold affects the revenue we recognize in the period  if we achieve
the target  level of total  orders but are unable to achieve our target  license
mix we may not meet our revenue targets if we deliver morethanexpected tsls
or may exceed them if we deliver morethanexpected  perpetuals if we achieve
the  target  license  mix but the  overall  level of orders is below the  target
level then we will not meet our revenue targets

     since  our  introduction  of  tsls  the  average  tsl  duration  has  been
approximately 13 quarters  our historical license order mix from august 2000 to
the present ie  since our adoption of tsls has been 24 perpetual licenses
and 76 ratable licenses  our target license mix for total new software license
orders  for the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2003 is 18 to 23  perpetual
licenses and 77 to 82 ratable  licenses  the precise mix of orders is subject
to substantial  fluctuation in any given quarter or multiple quarter periods in
the  fourth  quarter of fiscal  2002  the  license  mix was  approximately  27
perpetual licenses and 73 tsls in comparison to 14 perpetual licenses and 86
tsls in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2001 the license mix for full fiscal 2002
year was approximately 27 perpetual licenses and 73 tsls in comparison to 20
perpetual  licenses and 80 tsls for fiscal 2001 our target license mix for new
software license orders for fiscal 2003 is 22 to 27 perpetual licenses and 73
to 78  ratable  licenses  this range may be subject to change  based on market
conditions during the year

    revenue  total revenue for fiscal 2002  increased 33 to 9065  million as
compared to 6804  million for fiscal 2001  the increase in total  revenue for
fiscal  2002  as  compared  to  fiscal  2001  is due  primarily  to  the  avant
acquisition  and to the additional quarters that the tsl license model has been
used

    total revenue for fiscal 2001 decreased 13 to 6804 million as compared to
7838 million for fiscal 2000 the decrease in total revenue for fiscal 2001 as
compared to fiscal 2000 is due to the  utilization for the full 2001 fiscal year
of the tsl license  model and the related  inherent  decrease in current  period
revenue due to the timing of revenue recognition under this license model

    product  revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 50 to 2452 million as compared
to 1639  million for fiscal 2001  the increase in product  revenue for fiscal
2002 as compared to fiscal  2001 is due to an  increase  in  perpetual  licenses
delivered  during the period  which  resulted in large part from the  increased
volume of perpetual licenses after the avant merger  during the second quarter
of 2002 we began offering variable  maintenance  arrangements  vmp to certain
customers that entered into perpetual license technology  arrangements in excess
of 20 million under these arrangements  the annual fee for pcs is calculated
as a  percentage  of the net license fee rather than a fixed  percentage  of the
list price

    product  revenue for fiscal 2001 decreased 62 to 1639 million as compared
to 4341  million for fiscal 2000  the decrease in product  revenue for fiscal
2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was due to the  adoption of the tsl model under
which as explained above  revenue is recognized  ratably from a license model
under which virtually all license revenue was recognized in the quarter shipped

    service  revenue for fiscal 2002 decreased 16 to 2877 million as compared
to 3418  million for fiscal 2001  the decrease in service  revenue for fiscal
2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 is due to economic factors and the impact of our
adoption of tsls  economic  conditions  have led our  customers to reduce their
costs by  curtailing  their  use of  outside  consultants  and  in some  cases
discontinuing  maintenance on their perpetual licenses as a result we received
a lower volume of new  consulting  orders and  maintenance  renewal  orders than
expected in addition  certain projects in our consulting backlog were deferred
or cancelled  customer  expenditures on training have also been reduced  which
has accordingly reduced revenue from training  these conditions are expected to
continue at least until research and development  spending by the  semiconductor
industry  returns to historic  levels of growth  the shift to tsls has impacted
service  revenue in two ways  first  new licenses  structured  as tsls include
bundled  pcs  which means that revenue  attributable  to pcs is  recognized  as
ratable license revenue  if such licenses were perpetual licenses or timebased
licenses similar to the type formerly offered  the pcs revenue relating to such
licenses would be recognized as service revenue second customers with existing
perpetual  licenses are entering  into new tsls rather than  renewing the pcs on
the existing perpetual licenses  in each case revenue attributable to pcs that
otherwise  would have been  reflected  in service  revenue is now  reflected  in
ratable license revenue

    the decline in service revenue was partly offset by revenue  recognized from
services  contracts  acquired in the avant  merger  synopsys  recognized  less
revenue on these  contracts  than avant  would have  recognized due to the fact
that under  purchase  accounting  rules the  deferred  revenue  balance of these
contracts was significantly reduced upon acquisition

    service  revenue for fiscal 2001 remained  relatively flat at 3418 million
as compared to 3408  million in fiscal 2000 as growth in consulting  services
business  in the first  half of the year was  offset by  reduction  in  business
attributable to costcutting efforts by customers

    ratable  license revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 114 to 3736 million as
compared to 1746  million in fiscal  2001  the  increase  in ratable  license
revenue  for  fiscal  2002  compared  to  fiscal  2001 is due to the  additional
quarters that the tsl license model has been used

    ratable  license  revenue for fiscal  2001  increased  to 1746  million as
compared to 89 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in ratable license revenue
for fiscal 2001  compared  to fiscal 2002 is due to the fact that we  introduced
tsls  in the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2000  august  2000  and  therefore
relatively  little tsl revenue was  recognized  in fiscal 2000 because under the
tsl model relatively  little revenue is recognized in the quarter the product is
initially delivered

    related  party  transaction  approximately  8 of fiscal 2002 revenues were
derived from a company whose chief  financial and  enterprise  officer serves on
the synopsys board of directors  management  believes the transactions  between
the  two  parties  were  carried  out  under  the  companys  normal  terms  and
conditions

    revenue  seasonality  our revenue is seasonal  in general  revenue in the
first  quarter of our fiscal year is the lowest of any  quarter  and revenue in
the fourth quarter is the largest of any quarter with revenue in the second and
third  quarters  roughly in the middle of the first and  fourth  quarters  this
seasonal pattern may be attributed to a variety of factors  including  customer
buying patterns  the timing of major contract  renewals and sales  compensation
incentives

    revenue  product groups for management  reporting  purposes  our products
have been organized into four distinct product groups  design  implementation
verification  and test  design  analysis  intellectual  property ip  and a
services group   professional  services  the following  table  summarizes the
revenue  attributable  to the various  groups as a percentage  of total  company
revenue for the last eight quarters  revenue  attributable to products acquired
from avant that was recognized by avant prior to june 6 2002 is not reflected
in the following tables revenue attributable to such products from june 6 2002
through october 31 2002 is included in fiscal 2002 revenue  as a result of the
avant  merger we redefined our product groups  effective in the third quarter

     design implementation  design implementation includes products used in the
logic design and physical design phases of chip design as described above under
business  products  ic implementation  products for the design of a chip from
a high level functional description to a complete description of the transistors
and  connections  that  implement  such  functions  that can be  delivered  to a
semiconductor  company for  manufacturing  design  implementation  technologies
include logic synthesis  physical synthesis floor planning and placeandroute
products and technologies the principal products in this category as of the end
of fiscal 2002 are design compiler physical compiler chip architect floorplan
compiler   jupiter   apollo  and  astro  as  a  percent  of  revenue  design
implementation  fluctuated  between  38 and 42 in the  period  from the  first

quarter of fiscal 2000 through the second  quarter of fiscal 2002 and exhibited
a generally  increasing  trend from the first quarter of fiscal 2001 through the
second  quarter  of fiscal  2002  this trend  reflects  the  companys  growing
portfolio of design implementation  products during the period most notably the
introduction  of physical  compiler  the 3 increase from the second quarter of
fiscal  2002 to the third  quarter  of  fiscal  2002 is due  principally  to the
addition of avant  products  to this  category  since the  largest  portion of
avants  revenue was derived from products  including its principal  place and
route products that were added to the design implementation category

    verification  and test  verification  and test  includes  products used for
verification and analysis performed at the system level register transfer level
rtl and gate level of design  including  simulation  system level design and
verification  timing analysis formal verification  test and related products
the  principal  products in this  category  are vcs  polaris  vera  pathmill
cocentric system studio primetime formality design verifyer dft compiler and
tetramax  which  are used in  several  different  phases of chip  design  as a
percent of revenue  revenue from this product family fluctuated between 31 and
37 in the period  from the first  quarter  of fiscal  2001  through  the second
quarter of fiscal 2002 principally  attributable to the mix of perpetual versus
tsl orders received for verification and test products during any given quarter
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 verification and test revenues as
a  percent  of  total  company  revenue  were  lower  principally  because  the
verification and test product group does not include many products acquired from
avant

    design analysis design analysis includes products used for verification and
analysis performed  principally  during the physical  verification phase of chip
design  including  analog and mixed  signal  circuit  simulation  design  rule
checking  power analysis  customer design  semiconductor process modeling and
reliability  analysis  the  principal  products in this  category  are nanosim
starsim  hspice starrc  arcadia  tcad hercules  venus opc primepower and
cosmos  revenue from this product group as a percentage  of total  revenues has
ranged between 5 and 7 since the  introduction  of tsls as a result of the mix
of perpetual  versus  timebased  license  orders  received  during a particular
quarter  during the third  quarter of fiscal  2002  revenue  from this product
group as a percentage of total  revenues  increased to 17 due primarily to the
avant  acquisition  as the second  largest  portion of  avants  revenue  was
derived from products that were added to the design analysis category

    intellectual  property  our ip products  include the designware  library of
design  components and  verification  models  and the products  acquired in the
insilicon transaction effective in the fourth quarter of 2002 ip revenue as a
percent of total revenue was relatively stable from the fourth quarter of fiscal
2000 to the second quarter of fiscal 2002 reflecting growth consistent with the
company average beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2002 ip revenues as
a percent of total company revenue decreased  principally because the ip product
group does not include many products acquired from avant

    professional  services  the professional services group includes consulting
and training  activities  this group provides  consulting  services  including
design methodology  assistance  specialized  telecommunications  systems design
services and turnkey design  revenue from professional services as a percentage
of total  revenues has declined  from 14 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to
6 in the third  quarter of fiscal 2002  reflecting  as described  above under
revenue the impact of the economic environment

    cost of revenue  cost of revenue  consists of the cost of product  revenue
cost of service  revenue  cost of ratable license  revenue and  amortization of
intangible  assets and  deferred  stock  compensation  cost of product  revenue
includes  personnel and related  costs  production  costs  product  packaging
documentation  and amortization of capitalized  software  development costs and
purchased  technology  the cost of internally developed capitalized software is
amortized on the  straightline  method over the softwares  estimated  economic
life of approximately  two years  cost of service revenue  includes  consulting
services personnel and related costs associated with providing training and pcs
on perpetual  licenses  cost of ratable license  revenue  includes the costs of
product  and  services  related to our tsls tsls  include  bundled  product and
services  cost of product revenue cost of service revenue and cost of ratable
license  revenue during any period are heavily  dependent on the mix of software
orders received during such period

     cost of  revenue  amortization  of  intangible  assets and  deferred  stock
compensation  includes the  amortization of the contract  rights  intangible and
customer  backlog  assets  associated  with  certain  executory  contracts   as
discussed  under  acquisition  of  avant   corporation  and  acquisition  of
insilicon   corporation   respectively   below   and  the   amortization  of
coredeveloped  technology  acquired  in the  avant  insilicon  and  codesign
mergers total amortization of intangible assets which commenced on the date of
the  respective  acquisition  included in cost of revenues  for fiscal 2002 was
337 million which  includes  265 million and 72 million for core developed
technology  and  contract  rights  intangible  respectively  cost  of  revenue
amortization  also includes the  amortization of deferred stock  compensation as
discussed below under  amortization of intangible assets totaling 02 million
for the year ended october 2002

    total cost of revenue  as a  percentage  of total  revenue  for fiscal  2002
remained  relatively  flat at 19 as compared to fiscal 2001 cost of goods sold
which   excludes   amortization   of  intangible   assets  and  deferred  stock
compensation as a percentage of total revenue  decreased due to the increase in
quarterly  amortization  of deferred  revenue and backlog  which is an inherent
result of the use of the  ratable  license  model and due to the fact that other
cost of goods sold components remained relatively flat however the decrease in
cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2002 was offset by
the  commencement  of  amortization  of  the  contract  rights   intangible  and
coredeveloped technology recorded as a result of current year acquisitions

    total cost of revenue  as a  percentage  of total  revenue  for fiscal  2001
increased to 19 as compared to 16 in fiscal 2000 this 19 increase in cost of
revenue as a percentage  of total  revenue for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal
2000 is due to the writeoff of  intangible  assets  relating to a  discontinued
product totaling 18 million and an increase in the inventory  reserve totaling
13 million related to our hardware modeling product

    work force reduction during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 as part of an
overall cost reduction program  we implemented a workforce  reduction affecting
all  departments  both  domestic and foreign  as a result  our  workforce was
reduced  by  approximately  175  employees  and a charge of  approximately  39
million was included in operating  expenses  during the second quarter of fiscal
2002 this charge consists of severance and other special termination  benefits
these costs are reflected in the statement of operations as follows

    research and development  research and development expenses for fiscal 2002
increased 19 to 2255  million as compared to 1898  million for fiscal 2001
the increase in expenses is due to increases  of 287  million in  compensation
and  compensationrelated  costs as a result  of an  increase  in  research  and
development  headcount  due to the avant  acquisition  113  million in human
resources technology and facilities costs as a result of increased research and
development staffing and 42 million in depreciation  expense  these increases
were offset by decreases of 54 million in consulting expenses and 43 million
of other expenses including  facilities  travel  communications  supplies and
recruiting as a result of our cost reduction programs

    research and development  expenses for fiscal 2001 remained  relatively flat
at 1898  million as compared to 1893  million in fiscal  2000  research and
development  expenses increased in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 due to
increases in personnel related costs recruiting costs and depreciation expense
these increases were offset by a decrease in facilities  expense due to the fact
that  during the  fourth  quarter of fiscal  2000 we closed  certain  facilities
acquired  in the gambit  acquisition  and to  decreases  in  equipment  repairs
advertising expenses and travel and entertainment costs

     sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2002 decreased
3 to 2648  million as compared to 2740  million in fiscal 2001 the overall
decrease is due to decreases of 84 million in human resources  technology and
facilities costs as a result of a decrease in sales and marketing headcount as a
percentage of total headcount  13 million in employee functions 14 million
in   consulting   expenses  and  28  million  in  other   expenses   including
communications and supplies  charitable  contributions  professional services
subscriptions and memberships as a result of our cost reduction  efforts  these
decreases  are offset by increases of 48 million in  compensation  and related
costs  attributable  to an increase in sales and marketing  headcount  resulting
from the avant merger and 19 million in travel relating to customer visits to
discuss the potential integration of synopsys and avant products

     sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2001 decreased 5 to 2740 million
as  compared  to 2888  million in fiscal  2000  the  decrease  in fiscal 2001
compared to fiscal 2000 was due to  decreases  in annual  commissions  bonuses
travel consulting expenses  recruiting  advertising and depreciation expense
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in personnelrelated costs

     general and administrative  general and administrative expenses for fiscal
2002 increased 13 to 785 million as compared to 697 million in fiscal 2001
the overall increase is due to increases of 111 million in facilities costs as
a result of an increased number of sites due to the avant  merger 70 million
in  compensation  and  compensationrelated  costs  as  a  result  of  increased
headcount due to the avant  merger 56 million in professional  service fees
22  million in  communications  costs  16  million in  equipment  to update
licenses  for our  internal  enterprise  application  systems  14  million in
depreciation  and 29 million in other expenses  including  travel and property
tax assessments  these increases were offset by decreases of 200 million as a
result of decreased  general and  administrative  headcount  as a percentage  of
total  headcount  and 39 million in  consulting  costs as a result of our cost
reduction efforts

    general and  administrative  expenses for fiscal 2001 increased 18 to 697
as compared to 592 million  the increase in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal
2000  was due to  increases  in bad  debt  expense  facility  expenditures  and
consulting  services  related to the  upgrade of our current  computer  systems
these increases are offset by a decrease in personnel costs

    integration costs nonrecurring integration costs incurred relate to merger
activities which are not included in the purchase  consideration  under emerging
issues  task force  number  953 eitf  953  recognition  of  liabilities  in
connection  with a purchase  business  combination  these costs are expensed as
incurred  during fiscal 2002  integration costs totaled 1285 million  these
costs  consisted  primarily of i 950 million  related to the premium for the
insurance  policy  acquired in conjunction  with the avant  merger  ii 147
million  related to  writedowns  of synopsys  facilities and property under the
management  approved  facility  exit plan for the  avant  merger  iii  100
million and 07 million related to severance  costs for synopsys  employees who
were terminated and costs  associated  with transition  employees as a result of
the avant and insilicon mergers respectively iv 13 million related to the
writeoff of software licenses owned by synopsys which were originally purchased
from avant  v 37 million  goodwill  impairment  charge  related to a prior
synopsys  acquisition  as a result of the  acquisition  of avant  and vi 12

    purchased  inprocess  research and development  iprd of 877 million and
17 million in fiscal 2002 and 2000 respectively  represents the writeoff of
inprocess technologies associated with our acquisitions of avant and insilicon
in fiscal 2002 and leda in fiscal 2000 there were no acquisitions during fiscal
2001 at the date of each  acquisition  the projects  associated  with the iprd
efforts had not yet  reached  technological  feasibility  and the  research  and
development  in process  had no  alternative  future  uses  accordingly  these
amounts were charged to expense on the respective  acquisition  dates of each of
the acquired  companies  also see note 3  business  combinations  of notes to
synopsys consolidated financial statements

     valuation of iprd  we use an  independent  third party  valuation  firm to
assist  us  valuing  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  and the  inprocess
technologies acquired in each of our business  combinations  the value assigned
to acquired  inprocess  technology is determined by identifying  products under
research in areas for which technological  feasibility had not been established
the value of inprocess  technology is then segmented into two  classifications
i  developed   technology    completed  and  ii  inprocess   technology  
tobecompleted  giving  explicit  consideration  to the value  created  by the
research and development  efforts of the acquired  business prior to the date of
acquisition  and to be created by synopsys  after the  acquisition  these value
creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors  i
timebased data ii costbased data and iii complexitybased data

    the value of the inprocess  technology  was  determined  using a discounted
cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the incomeproducing
capabilities of the inprocess  technologies  under this approach the value is
determined  by  estimating  the revenue  contribution  generated  by each of the
identified products within the classification  segments  revenue estimates were
based on i individual  product revenues  ii anticipated growth rates iii
anticipated product development and introduction  schedules  iv product sales
cycles and v the estimated life of a products underlying technology from the
revenue  estimates  operating  expense  estimates  including  costs of  sales
general and administrative selling and marketing income taxes and a use charge
for contributory  assets  were deducted to arrive at operating income  revenue
growth  rates  were   estimated  by   management   for  each  product  and  gave
consideration  to relevant  market sizes and growth factors  expected  industry
trends the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and
our competitors individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each
products underlying  technology  operating expense estimates reflect synopsys
historical expense ratios  additionally  these projects will require continued
research and development  after they have reached a state of  technological  and
commercial feasibility  the resulting operating income stream was discounted to
reflect its present value at the date of the  acquisition  these  estimates are
subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development  process  and no
assurance can be given that  deviations  from these  estimates will not occur or
that we will realize any anticipated benefits of the acquisition

    the rate used to  discount  the net cash  flows  from  purchased  inprocess
technology is our weighted  average cost of capital wacc  taking into account
our  required  rates  of  return  from  investments  in  various  areas  of  the
enterprise   and  reflecting  the  inherent  uncertainties  in  future  revenue
estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty  surrounding the
successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of
such technology  the profitability  levels of such technology  if any and the
uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at this time

    avant the iprd expense related to the avant  merger was 825 million at
the date of the  avant  merger  the  principal  inprocess  technologies  were
identified based on the following avant  product  families  physical  products
division ppd verification products division vpd analysis products division
apd  logical products division lpd mtb technology  computeraided  design
tcad and  analogy  for  purposes of valuing the iprd in  accordance  with the
methodology  discussed above the following  estimates were used revenue growth
ranging from 16 beginning in year two to 10 in year nine  cost of sales  7
of revenue in each year general and administrative expenses  5 of revenue in
each year  and sales and marketing  28 of revenue in each year in addition

it was assumed there would be no expense reduction due to economic  synergies as
a result of the  acquisition  the rate used to discount the net cash flows from
the purchased  inprocess  technology was in the range of 27 the  technologies
were  approximately  40 to 90 complete at the acquisition  date the nature of
the efforts to complete  these  projects  related  in varying  degrees  to the
completion of all planning designing  prototyping  verification  and testing
activities  that are necessary to establish that the proposed  technologies  met
their  design  specifications  including  functional  technical  and economic
performance  requirements  expenditures  to complete  the  acquired  inprocess
technologies are expected to total approximately 175 million

    insilicon  the iprd expense  related to the insilicon  acquisition was 52
million  at  the  date  of  the  insilicon  merger  the  principal  inprocess
technologies  were identified  based on the following  insilicon  product lines
ethernet  joint photographic experts group jpeg java technology  peripheral
component  interconnect  pci  pcix and universal  serial business usb for
purposes of valuing the iprd in accordance with the methodology discussed above
the following estimates were used revenue growth ranging from 300 beginning in
year three for certain  products to revenue  decline of 50 in year ten cost of
sales  8 of revenue in each year  and  selling  general and  administrative
expenses   ranging  from 45 of  revenue  in year two to 30 of revenue in year
seven  in addition  it was assumed there would be no expense  reduction due to
economic  synergies as a result of the  acquisition  the rates used to discount
the net cash flows from the purchased  inprocess  technology  range from 26 to
36 the technologies were  approximately 20 to 67 complete at the acquisition
date the nature of the efforts to complete these projects  related  in varying
degrees   to  the   completion   of  all  planning   designing   prototyping
verification  and testing  activities  that are necessary to establish that the
proposed  technologies met their design  specifications  including  functional
technical and economic performance  requirements  expenditures to complete the
acquired  inprocess  technologies  are  expected  to total  approximately  49
million

    during  fiscal 2000  we made an  acquisition  resulting  in aggregate  iprd
charges of 17 million  which was not  individually  material to the results of
our  operations in the  respective  year the fair value of the related iprd was
determined in a manner substantially similar to that described above

    the risks  associated with acquired  research and development are considered
high and no assurance can be made that these  products will generate any benefit
to us or meet market expectations

     amortization of intangible  assets  goodwill  represents the excess of the
aggregate  purchase  price over the fair value of the tangible and  identifiable
intangible   assets  we  have  acquired   goodwill  for  our  prefiscal   2002
acquisitions  and intangible  assets are amortized over their  estimated  useful
lives of three to ten  years  we  assess  the  recoverability  of  goodwill  by
estimating  whether the  unamortized  cost will be recovered  through  estimated
future  undiscounted  cash flows  amortization of intangible  assets charged to
operating expenses for fiscal 2002 increased 68 to 286 million as compared to
170 million for fiscal 2001 the increase in amortization of intangible assets
charged to  operations  for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 is due to the
amortization  of  intangible  assets  acquired  in  the  avant  insilicon  and
codesign  mergers during the current year the financial  accounting  standards
board  recently  issued  new  guidance  with  respect  to the  amortization  and
evaluation  of goodwill  this new guidance is discussed  below under effect of
new accounting standards

     in connection with the current year mergers we also assumed unvested stock
options held by avant  insilicon  and  codesign  employees  we have recorded
deferred stock compensation totaling 81 million 17 million and 07 million
based on the intrinsic value of these assumed unvested stock options for avant
insilicon  and  codesign  respectively  the deferred  stock  compensation  is
amortized  over the  options  remaining  vesting  period of one to three years
during fiscal 2002 we recorded  amortization of deferred stock  compensation in
each of the following expense classifications in the statement of operations

    amortization of intangible  assets charged to operating  expenses for fiscal
2001 increased 13 to 170 million as compared to 151 million in fiscal 2000
the increase in  amortization  of intangible  assets  charged to operations  for
fiscal  2001 as  compared  to fiscal  2000 is due to the  writeoff  of  certain
technology  totaling  18 million  acquired  from  and goodwill  totaling 04
million related to the acquisition of eagle design automation inc in 1997 and
to the  fact  that  the  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  related  to  certain
acquisitions  completed  during fiscal 2000 were  amortized for the full year of
fiscal 2001

    we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not  be  recoverable  if  this  evaluation  indicates  that  the  value  of the
intangible asset may be impaired an assessment of the recoverability of the net
carrying  value of the asset over its  remaining  useful  life is made  if this
assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the
estimated  undiscounted  future cash flows of the entity or technology  acquired
over the remaining  amortization  period  the net carrying value of the related
intangible  asset will be reduced to fair value and the  remaining  amortization
period may be adjusted  in fiscal 2002 we  recognized an aggregate  impairment
charge  of 38  million  to reduce  the  amount of  certain  intangible  assets
associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value  approximately
37  million  and  01  million  are  included  in  integration   expense  and
amortization of intangible assets respectively on the statement of operations
the impairment charge is primarily  attributable to certain technology  acquired
from and goodwill related to the acquisition of stanza  inc in 1999  during
the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2002  we  determined  that we would not allocate
future  resources to assist in the market growth of this  technology as products
acquired in the merger with avant provide customers with superior  capabilities
and we do not anticipate any future sales of the product

    in fiscal 2001 we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of 22 million

    the initial  allocation of the purchase  price  included  certain assets and
liabilities that we recorded using preliminary  estimates of fair value  during
the fourth  quarter of 2002  the value  assigned  to avants  investment  in a
venture capital fund was reduced from the preliminary  value of 128 million to
50  million  upon  obtaining  additional  information  on the  venture  funds
nonpublic  investments  and subsequent sale of the investment to a third party
the decrease in the fair value of the  investment  increased  the  consideration
allocated to goodwill by 78 million  during the fourth  quarter of 2002  the
company also increased the value of the acquired customs and usetax liabilities
by 25 million resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill

determined  that the  libraries  business  would not be sold  and  accordingly

     contract rights  intangible  avant had executed signed license agreements
and delivered the initial  configuration of licensed  technologies under ratable
license arrangements and had executed signed contracts to provide pcs over a one
to three year period  for which avant did not consider the fees to be fixed or
determinable  at the outset of the  arrangement  there were no  receivables  or
deferred revenues recorded on avants  historical  financial  statements at the
closing date as the related  payments  were not yet due under  extended  payment
terms and deliveries are scheduled to occur over the terms of the  arrangements
these ratable licenses and pcs arrangements  require future  performance by both
parties  and  as such  represent  executory  contracts  the  contract  rights
intangible asset  associated with these  arrangements is being amortized to cost
of revenue over the related contract lives of three years

     the amortization of intangible  assets  with the exception of the contract
rights  intangible  and  coredeveloped  technology  is included  in  operating
expenses in the  statement of  operations  for the fiscal year ended october 31

effect of new accounting standards

    in july  2001  the  financial  accounting  standards  board  fasb  issued
statements  of financial  accounting  standards no 141  business  combinations
sfas 141  and  financial  accounting  standards  no 142  goodwill and other
intangible  assets  sfas 142  sfas 141 requires  that the purchase  method of
accounting be used for all business  combinations  initiated after june 30 2001
and specifies criteria  intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business
combination  must meet to be recognized  apart from goodwill  sfas 142 requires
that goodwill and intangible  assets with  indefinite  useful lives no longer be
amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance
with the provisions of sfas 142

    we adopted sfas 142 on november 1 2002 as of october 31 2002 unamortized
goodwill is 4346 million  which will no longer be amortized subsequent to the
adoption of sfas 142  related  goodwill  amortization  expense for fiscal 2002
2001 and 2000 is 162 million 170 million and 151 million respectively

    we  adopted  the  provisions  of sfas 141 on july 1  2001  under sfas 141
goodwill  and  intangible  assets with  indefinite  useful  lives  acquired in a
purchase business combination completed after june 30 2001 but before sfas 142
is  adopted  will  not be  amortized  but will  continue  to be  evaluated  for
impairment in accordance with sfas 121  goodwill and intangible assets acquired
in  business  combinations  completed  before  july 1 2001 will  continue to be
amortized  and tested for  impairment  in  accordance  with  current  accounting
guidance until the date of adoption of sfas 142

    upon adoption of sfas 142 we must evaluate our existing  intangible  assets
and goodwill acquired in purchase business  combinations  prior to july 1 2001
and make any  necessary  reclassifications  in  order  to  conform  with the new
criteria in sfas 141 for recognition apart from goodwill  upon adoption of sfas
142 we have assessed useful lives and residual values of all intangible  assets
acquired  we have also tested  goodwill for  impairment in accordance  with the
provisions  of  sfas  142  in  completing  our  impairment  analysis  we  have
determined  that we have  one  reporting  unit as the  company  operates  in one
reportable  segment  in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 142 we
have completed a goodwill  impairment  review as of the beginning of fiscal 2003
and found no impairment  this impairment  review was based on the fair value of
the company as determined by its market capitalization

    in july 2001 the fasb issued  statement of financial  accounting  standards
no 143  accounting  for asset  retirement  obligations  sfas  143  sfas 143
requires  that  asset  retirement   obligations   that  are  identifiable   upon
acquisition  construction  or  development  and during the operating  life of a
longlived  asset be  recorded as a  liability  using the  present  value of the
estimated cash flows a corresponding amount would be capitalized as part of the
assets  carrying  amount and amortized to expense over the assets useful life
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas 143 effective  november 1 2002
the  adoption of sfas 143 will not have a  significant  impact on our  financial
position and results of operations

    in august 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial  accounting standards
no 144  accounting for the  impairment or disposal of longlived  assets sfas
144 which addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived  assets and supersedes  sfas no 121  accounting for the
impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of and
the  accounting  and reporting  provisions of apb opinion no 30  reporting the
results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business we are required
to adopt the provisions of sfas 144 no later than november 1 2002 the adoption
of sfas 144 will not have a  significant  impact on our  financial  position and
results of operations

    in july 2002 the fasb issued  statement of financial  accounting  standards
no  146  sfas  146  accounting  for exit or  disposal  activities  sfas 146
addresses  the  recognition  measurement  and  reporting  of  costs  that  are
associated  with  exit and  disposal  activities  including  costs  related  to
terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that
employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a onetime
benefit  arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual
deferredcompensation  contract  sfas 146 supersedes emerging issues task force
issue no 943 liability  recognition for certain employee termination benefits
and other  costs to exit an  activity  including  certain  costs  incurred in a
restructuring  and  requires  liabilities  associated  with  exit and  disposal
activities  to be expensed as incurred  sfas 146 will be effective  for exit or
disposal  activities  of ours that are  initiated  after  december 31 2002  we
believe that the adoption of sfas 146 will not have a significant  impact on our
financial position and results of operations

transition  and  disclosure  sfas 148 amends fasb statement no 123 sfas 123
accounting  for  stockbased  compensation  to provide  alternative  methods of
transition  for a voluntary  change to the fair value based method of accounting
for  stockbased  employee  compensation  in  addition  sfas  148  amends  the
disclosure  requirements  of sfas 123 to require  prominent  disclosures in both
annual and  interim  financial  statements  about the method of  accounting  for
stockbased employee  compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results  the transition  guidance and annual disclosure  provisions of sfas 148
are  effective  for fiscal  years ending  after  december 15 2002  the interim
disclosure  provisions are effective for financial reports containing  financial
statements  for interim  periods  beginning  after  december  15  2002  we are
currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  adoption  of sfas  148 on our  financial
position and results of operations

    in november  2002  the eitf  reached a consensus  on issue no  0021 eitf
0021  revenue arrangements with multiple  deliverables  eitf 0021 addresses
certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for  arrangements  under which the
vendor will perform multiple revenue generating  activities  eitf 0021 will be
effective for fiscal years  beginning  after june 15 2003 we do not expect the
adoption of eitf 0021 to have a material  impact on our financial  position and
results of operations

    in  november  2002  the fasb  interpretation  no 45  interpretation  45
guarantors  accounting and disclosure  requirements  for guarantees  including
indirect  guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies  disclosure and
recognitionmeasurement   requirements   related  to  certain  guarantees   the
disclosure  requirements  are effective for  financial  statements  issued after

a prospective  basis for guarantees  issued or modified after december 31 2002
we are currently  evaluating the impact of adoption of  interpretation 45 on our

liquidity and capital resources

    cash  cash  equivalents and shortterm  investments  were 4147 million at
october 31 2002 a decrease of 617  million  or 13 from 4764  million at
october 31  2001  cash used in  operating  activities  was 1810  million for
fiscal 2002 compared to cash provided by operating  activities of 2955 million
in fiscal 2001  the  decrease in cash flows from  operating  activities  is due
primarily to the insurance  premium payments  totaling 3358 million related to
the avant  acquisition and payments for income taxes and other liabilities made
during the year

    cash  provided by  investing  activities  was 2757  million in fiscal 2002
compared to 618 million provided by investing  activities  during fiscal 2001
the increase of 2139 million in 2002 in cash provided by investing  activities
is due  primarily  to the cash  acquired in the 2002  acquisitions  net of cash
received  of 1683 million net proceeds from the sale of short and longterm
investments  totaled  1578 million for fiscal 2002 as compared to net proceeds
of  investments  of 1415  million for fiscal 2001  the cash received from the
sales of investments  during fiscal 2002 was primarily used to purchase treasury
stock capital expenditures totaled 488 million during fiscal 2002 compared to
825  million in fiscal 2001  during fiscal 2001 we invested in fixed assets
primarily  related  to  construction  of our  oregon  facilities  and  computing
equipment  to  upgrade  our  internal  engineering  and  enterprise  application
systems

    we used  518  million in net cash for  financing  activities  during  2002
compared to 2327 in fiscal  2001  the primary  financing  uses of cash during
2002 were the  repurchase  of 39 million  shares of common  stock at an average
price of 4420 per share  financing  proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant
to our employee stock plans during fiscal 2002 were 1199  million  compared to
1054 million during fiscal 2001

    accounts  receivable  increased 609 million  or 41 to 2072 million at
october  31 2002 from  1463  million at october  31 2001  largely due to the
avant merger days sales outstanding which is calculated based on revenues for
the most recent  quarter and accounts  receivable  as of the balance  sheet date
decreased  to 61 days as of october 31  2002 from 73 days at october 31  2001
the  decrease  in days sales  outstanding  is due in part to the timing of large
cash collections realized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002

    we believe that our current cash cash equivalents  shortterm  investments
and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at
least the next twelve months

grants  in a given  year to the  number  of  shares  outstanding  the  dilution
percentage is  calculated as the new option grants for the year  net of options
forfeited by employees  leaving the  company  divided by the total  outstanding
shares at the end of the year  the option  dilution  percentages  were 34 and
63 for fiscal  2002 and 2001  respectively  we also have a share  repurchase
program  where we  regularly  repurchase  shares  from the open market to offset
dilution related to our option program

factors that may affect future results

     weakness in the  semiconductor  and  electronics  businesses may negatively
impact synopsys  business  synopsys business depends on the semiconductor and
electronics industries during 2001 and 2002 these industries experienced steep
declines in orders and revenue  in february  2002  for example  semiconductor
sales on a three month rolling average basis were down  approximately 45 from
their  alltime peak  reached in october 2000 by october 2002  sales remained
33  below the peak  despite  this  marginal  improvement  customers  report a
significant lack of visibility in their businesses  and this has affected their
buying behavior customers are scrutinizing their purchases of eda software very
carefully in addition  they are increasingly  demanding  and we have granted
extended  payment  terms on their  purchases  which has affected our cash flow
based on our  interactions  with customers  synopsys does not expect a material
recovery in the  semiconductor  and electronics  industries in 2003 if recovery
continues  we  believe  that it will be very  gradual  at  best  consequently
synopsys is not expecting material growth in the eda industry in 2003


     demand for electronic design automation  products is largely dependent upon
the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their
customers  the  increasing  complexity  of  designs  and the  number  of design
engineers  during 2001 and 2002 many  semiconductor  and  electronic  companies
cancelled  or deferred  design  projects and reduced  their  design  engineering
staffs  the  formation  of  new  companies  engaged  in  semiconductor  design
traditionally  an  important  source of new  business  for the  company  slowed
significantly  and a small number of existing  customers  went out of business
each of these developments  negatively  impacted our orders and revenue  demand
for our  products  and  services  may also be  affected by  partnerships  andor
mergers in the  semiconductor  and  systems  industries  given  current  market
conditions  the rate of mergers and acquisitions may increase during 2003 such
combinations  may reduce the  aggregate  level of  purchases of our products and
services by the companies involved

     continuation  or worsening of the current  conditions in the  semiconductor
and electronics industries and continued consolidation among our customers all
could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial  condition and
results of operations

    synopsys  revenue and  earnings  may  fluctuate  many  factors  affect our
revenue and earnings  which makes it difficult to predict  revenue and earnings
for any given  fiscal  period  among  these  factors are  customer  product and
service demand  product license terms and the timing of revenue recognition on
products and services sold the following are some of the specific  factors that
could affect our revenue and  earnings in a  particular  quarter or over several
quarterly or annual periods

o    our products are complex  and before buying them  customers  spend a great
     deal of time  reviewing and testing them  our  customers  evaluation  and
     purchase  cycles do not  necessarily  match our quarterly  periods  in the
     past we have received a disproportionate volume of orders in the last week
     of a quarter  this trend has become more pronounced in recent quarters in
     addition a large proportion of our business is attributable to our largest
     customers  as a result  if any order  and  especially a large order  is
     delayed beyond the end of a fiscal period our orders for that period could
     be below our plan and our revenue for that period or future  periods  could
     be below our plan and any targets we may have published

o    our business is seasonal  orders and revenue are  typically  lowest in our
     first  fiscal  quarter and  highest in our fourth  fiscal  quarter  with a
     material  decline  between  the fourth  quarter of one fiscal  year and the
     first quarter of the next fiscal year this difference is driven largely by
     the  volume of  perpetual  licenses  shipped  during  the  quarter  which
     following the seasonal pattern of overall orders  typically  declines from
     the fourth quarter to the first quarter

o    our revenue and earnings  targets for any fiscal period are based in part
     upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain volume of overall orders
     and a mix of perpetual  licenses  on which  revenue is  recognized  in the
     quarter  shipped and tsls on which revenue is recognized over the term of
     license within a specified range  which is adjusted from time to time if
     we receive the targeted volume of overall orders but a lowerthan  expected
     proportion  of perpetual  orders  then our revenue for the quarter will be
     below our target for the quarter  though the shortfall  will be recognized
     in future quarters conversely if we receive a lowerthanexpected volume
     of overall  orders but the expected  volume of perpetual  orders  then our
     revenue for the period may be on target  though  revenue in future periods
     will be lower than expected

o    accounting  rules  determine when revenue is recognized on our orders  and
     therefore  impact  how much  revenue  we will  report in any  given  fiscal
     period in general  revenue is recognized on tsls ratably over the term of
     the license and on perpetual licenses upon delivery of the license for any
     given order however the specific terms agreed to with a customer may have
     the  effect  under the  accounting  rules of  requiring  revenue  treatment
     different  from the treatment we intended and in developing  our financial
     plans  expected as a result  revenue for the fiscal period may be higher
     or lower than it otherwise  would have been and different than our plan or
     any announced targets for such period


    competition  may have a  material  adverse  effect on  synopsys  results of
operations the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda
vendors  and with  customers  internally  developed  design tools and internal
design  capabilities  for a share of the overall  eda  budgets of our  potential
customers  in general  competition  is based on product  quality and features
postsale support interoperability with other vendors products price payment
terms and as discussed  below the ability to offer a complete design flow our
competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services
such as cadence design systems inc and mentor graphics corporation as well as
companies  that offer  products  focused on a discrete  phase of the  integrated
circuit design process  in the current economic  environment  price and payment
terms have  increased in  importance as a basis for  competition  during fiscal
2002 we have  increasingly  agreed to extended  payment terms on our tsls which
has had a negative effect on cash flow from operations  in addition in certain
situations our competitors are offering aggressive  discounts on their products
as a result average prices may fall

                                       46
page

    if we are unable to develop an integrated  design flow product and other new
products we may be unable to compete  effectively  increasingly  eda companies
compete on the basis of design  flows  involving  integrated  logic and physical
design products rather than on the basis of individual  point tools performing a
discrete  phase of the design  process  the need to offer an integrated  design
flow will become  increasingly  important  as ics grow more  complex  after the
acquisition of avant we offer all of the point tools required to design an ic
some of which  integrate logic and physical  design  capabilities  our products
compete  principally  with design flow  products  from  cadence and magma design
automation which in some respects may be more integrated than our products our
future success  depends on our ability to integrate  synopsys  logic design and
physical  synthesis  products with the physical  design  products  acquired from
avant which will require significant engineering and development work success
in this project is especially  important as the company believes that its orders
and  revenue  from  design  compiler  which  has  accounted  for 29 and 18 of
synopsys  orders in 2001 and 2002  respectively  peaked in fiscal year 2001 as
predicted  and are likely to  continue  to decline  over time  there can be no
guarantee  that we will be able to offer a competitive  complete  design flow to
customers  if we are unsuccessful in developing integrated design flow products
on a  timely  basis  or if we  are  unsuccessful  in  developing  or  convincing
customers  to  adopt  such   products   our   competitive   position  could  be
significantly weakened

    in order to  sustain  revenue  growth  over the long  term  we will have to
enhance our existing  products  introduce  new products  that are accepted by a
broad range of  customers  and to  generate  growth in our  consulting  services
business in addition to the development of integrated logic and physical design
products  synopsys is attempting to integrate its verification  products into a
comprehensive  functional  verification platform and is expanding its offerings
of  intellectual  property  design  components  product success is difficult to
predict  the  introduction  of new  products  and  growth of a market  for such
products cannot be assured in the past we like all companies  have introduced
new products that have failed to meet our revenue expectations  there can be no
assurance  that we will be successful in expanding  revenue from existing or new
products  at the  desired  rate  and the failure to do so would have a material
adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

    businesses  that  synopsys has acquired or that  synopsys may acquire in the
future may not perform as projected we have acquired or merged with a number of
companies in recent  years  and as part of our efforts to increase  revenue and
expand our product and services offerings we may acquire  additional  companies
during 2002 we acquired avant insilicon corporation and codesign automation
inc in addition to direct costs acquisitions pose a number of risks including
potential  dilution of earnings per share  problems in integrating the acquired
products  and  employees  into our  business  the  failure to realize  expected
synergies or cost savings the failure of acquired products to achieve projected
sales the drain on management time for acquisitionrelated  activities adverse
effects on customer buying patterns and assumption of unknown liabilities while
we attempt to review  proposed  acquisitions  carefully and negotiate terms that
are  favorable  to us there is no assurance  that any  acquisition  will have a
positive effect on our performance

     delays or cancellation of consulting  projects or customer payment defaults
could have a material  adverse effect on the companys  financial  condition and
results of  operations  as of december 1 2002  the company had  approximately
13 billion in backlog as defined in item 1  business  sales  distribution
and  backlog  the company  expects that this  backlog will turn into  revenue
orders for professional services which constitute less than 100 million of the
total backlog  may be deferred or cancelled by the customer in the event that a
project  is  delayed or  cancelled  though in some cases the  company is paid a
cancellation  fee  in the case of orders for the  companys  software  backlog
includes only amounts subject to committed  noncancelable  orders such orders
are not subject to cancellation or delay by the customer  but may fail to yield
the expected  revenue in the event that the  customer  defaults and fails to pay
amounts  owed  in  such  cases  the  company  will  generally  institute  legal
proceedings to recover  amounts owed to date the company has not experienced a
material  level of defaults  though in the current  economic  environment it is
possible that the level of defaults will increase see managements  discussion
and  analysis  of  results  of  operation  and  financial  condition   critical
accounting  policies  allowance for doubtful  accounts  any material  payment
default by the companys  customers could have a material  adverse effect on the
companys financial condition and results of operations

    continued  stagnation  of  foreign  economies  would  adversely  affect  our
performance  during  fiscal  2002  35 of our revenue was derived from outside
north  america  as  compared  to 37  during  fiscal  2001  foreign  sales are
vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic or political conditions the global
electronics  industry has  experienced  steep declines in 2001 and 2002 and the
company does not expect  material  recovery in 2003 in particular  a number of
our largest european customers are in the telecommunications equipment business
which has been  disproportionately  affected  during this  period  the japanese
economy has been  stagnant for several  years  and there is no  expectation  of
improvement in the near future  if the japanese  economy remains weak  revenue
and  orders  from  japan  and  perhaps  the  rest of asia  could be  adversely
affected


                                       47
page

    foreign sales are also  vulnerable to changes in foreign  currency  exchange
rates  either by making  the  companys  products  more  expensive  to  foreign
customers or by reducing the reported  revenue realized from overseas sales the
company is  particularly  exposed to the euro and the japanese  yen  though the
company  attempts to hedge its risks related to forecasted  accounts  receivable
generally  associated  with sales  contracts  with  extended  payment  terms and
accounts payable  denominated in nonfunctional  currencies  the yendollar and
eurodollar  exchange  rates  remain  subject  to  unpredictable   fluctuations
weakness of either currency could adversely affect revenue and orders from those
regions conversely if those currencies strengthen our expenses denominated in
those currencies  which are not hedged  could increase  asian countries other
than japan also have experienced economic and currency problems in recent years
and in some  cases  they have not fully  recovered  although  the asia  pacific
region is growing it is relatively  small as a percentage of our business and it
could be  difficult  to sustain  growth in the region if the rest of the worlds
economies  continue  to  stagnate  if  economic  conditions  worsen  orders and
revenues from the asia pacific region would be adversely affected

    a failure to recruit and retain key employees would have a material  adverse
effect on our ability to compete  our  success is  dependent  on our ability to
attract and retain key  technical  sales and  managerial  employees  including
those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions despite recent economic
conditions  skilled  technical  sales  and  management  employees  are in high
demand there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and
the  competition  for such  individuals  is intense  experience  at synopsys is
highly valued in the eda industry and the general electronics industry  and our
employees  including  employees  that have joined  synopsys in connection  with
acquisitions  are recruited  aggressively  in the past we have  experienced a
high rate of employee turnover  which may recur in the future  there can be no
assurance  that  we can  continue  to  recruit  and  retain  the  technical  and
managerial personnel we need to run our business successfully  failure to do so
could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial  condition and
results of operations

    in  addition  new  regulations  proposed  by  the  nasdaq  national  market
requiring  shareholder  approval  for  all  stock  option  plans  as well as new
regulations  proposed  by the new york stock  exchange  prohibiting  nyse member
organizations  from giving a proxy to vote on  equitycompensation  plans unless
the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting  instructions  could make it
more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future to the extent
that new  regulations  make it more  difficult or expensive to grant  options to
employees  we may incur increased cash compensation  costs or find it difficult
to attract retain and motivate employees  either of which could materially and
adversely affect our business

    a failure  to  protect  our  proprietary  technology  would  have a material
adverse effect on synopsys financial  condition and results of operations  our
success  is  dependent  in part  upon our  proprietary  technology  and  other
intellectual  property rights  we rely on agreements with customers  employees
and  others  and  intellectual   property  laws  to  protect  our  proprietary
technology  there  can  be no  assurance  that  these  agreements  will  not be
breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade
secrets  will not  otherwise  become  known  or be  independently  developed  by
competitors   moreover  effective  intellectual  property  protection  may  be
unavailable  or  limited  in  certain  foreign  countries  failure to obtain or
maintain  appropriate  patent  copyright  or trade secret  protection  for any
reason  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on our  business  financial
condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurance that
infringement  claims will not be asserted  against us and any such claims  could
require  us  to  enter  into  royalty  arrangements  or  result  in  costly  and
timeconsuming  litigation  or  could  subject  us  to  damages  or  injunctions
restricting our sale of products or could require us to redesign products

    our operating expenses do not fluctuate proportionately with fluctuations in
revenues  which could materially  adversely affect our results of operations in
the event of a shortfall in revenue our operating expenses are based in part on
our expectations of future revenue  and expense levels are generally  committed
in advance of revenue  since only a small  portion of our expenses  varies with
revenue  a shortfall  in revenue  translates  directly  into a reduction in net
income if we are unsuccessful in generating  anticipated revenue or maintaining
expenses within the expected range  however our business  financial condition
and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

    synopsys has adopted antitakeover provisions  which may have the effect of
delaying  or  preventing  changes of control or  management  we have  adopted a
number  of  provisions  that  could  have  antitakeover  effects  our board of
directors has adopted a preferred shares rights plan  commonly referred to as a
poison pill  in addition  our board of directors  has the  authority  without
further action by its  stockholders  to issue additional shares of common stock
and  to  fix  the  rights  and  preferences  of  and to  issue  authorized  but
undesignated  shares of preferred stock these and other provisions of synopsys
restated  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws and the  delaware  general
corporation law may have the effect of deterring  hostile  takeovers or delaying
or  preventing   changes  in  control  or  management  of  synopsys   including
transactions in which the  stockholders  of synopsys might  otherwise  receive a
premium for their shares over then current market prices

    synopsys is subject to changes in financial accounting standards  which may
affect our  reported  revenue  or the way we conduct  business  we prepare our
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the united states of america gaap  gaap are subject to  interpretation  by
the financial  accounting  standards board the american  institute of certified
public  accountants  aicpa  the sec and  various  bodies  appointed  by these
organizations  to interpret  existing rules and create new accounting  policies
accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition  in particular have
been the subject of frequent  interpretations  which have had a profound affect
on the way we license our products  as a result of the recent  enactment of the
sarbanesoxley  act and the related  scrutiny of accounting  policies by the sec
and the various national and international accounting industry bodies we expect
the frequency of accounting  policy  changes to  accelerate  future  changes in
financial accounting  standards  including  pronouncements  relating to revenue
recognition  may have a significant effect on our reported results and may even
affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective

      the fasb and other accounting bodies are currently considering a change to
us gaap that  if  implemented  would  require us to account  for  options as a
compensation expense in the period in which they are granted synopsys currently
accounts for stock options under statement of financial accounting standards no
123  accounting for stockbased  compensation  sfas 123 as permitted by sfas
123 the company has elected to use the  intrinsic  value method  prescribed  by
accounting  principles  board  opinion no 25  accounting  for stock  issued to
employees apb 25 to measure  compensation  expense for stockbased  awards to
employees  under  which  the  granting  of a  stock  option  is not  considered
compensation  although the impact of expensing  stock options is disclosed in
note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we cannot predict
whether  such a  requirement  will be  adopted  but if it is  there  would be a
significant negative effect on our reported results of operations

pending acquisitions

     on july 2 2001 the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger
with ikos systems inc ikos which manufactures hardwareassisted
verification systems on december 3 2001 the company entered into an agreement
and plan of merger with avant corporation which makes eda software principally
serving the physical design portion of the market the proposed mergers are
described under item 7 below

     except in limited respects this report on form 10k discusses synopsys
business as of the end of fiscal 2001 and before giving effect to either
proposed merger

introduction

     synopsys inc synopsys or the company is a leading supplier of
electronic design automation eda software to the global electronics industry
the companys products are used by designers of integrated circuits ics
including systemonachip ics and the electronic products such as computers
cell phones and internet routers that use such ics to automate significant
portions of their chip design process ics are distinguished by the speed at
which they run their area the amount of power they consume and the cost of
production the companys products offer its customers the opportunity to design
ics that are optimized for speed area power consumption and production cost

services to assist customers with their ic designs as well as training and
support services synopsys was incorporated in delaware in 1987

the role of eda in the electronics industry

     over the past three decades technology advances in the semiconductor
industry have dramatically increased the size speed and capacity of ics

      the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip has doubled
       roughly every 18 months a stateoftheart ic may hold over 40 million
       transistors this is made possible in large part because the width of the
       features on the chip is steadily shrinking mainstream ic designs today
       are produced at a 018 micron process with advanced chips being produced
       at a 013 micron process over the next several years the bulk of
       production will shift to 013 micron or below

      the speed at which chips operate has steadily increased microprocessors
       operating at 2 gigahertz a speed that was unheard of a few years ago
       are available today

      chips are also becoming more economical in their power consumption which
       is necessary to drive more and more powerful handheld devices

                                        2

      increasingly functions that formerly were performed by multiple ics
       attached to a printed circuit board are being combined in a single chip
       referred to as a systemonachip

     combined these changes have fostered the development of computers
internet routers wireless communications networks handheld personal digital
assistants and many other goods and services with tremendous capabilities at
relatively low cost

     competition and continuing innovation have shortened the life cycle of
electronic products so timetomarket is crucial to the success of a product
timetomarket can in large part be determined by the time it takes to design
the chip that will run such product eda products play a critical role in
reducing timetomarket for new products by providing ic designers with tools
and techniques to a reduce the time and manual effort required to design
analyze and verify individual ics b improve the performance and density of
complex ic designs and c enhance the reliability of the ic design and
manufacturing process

the design process

     in simplified form the design of an integrated circuit consists of five
basic steps

     system design  first a designer describes the functions that the chip is
to perform in a specialized highlevel computer language during this phase
designers perform high level architectural design tradeoffs to determine for
example which algorithms to use to implement the design and what portions of
the design to implement in hardware and what portions in software at the
completion of this phase the designer produces a register transfer level or
rtl description of the chip most of this process is completed manually
although there is a small but growing market for products that help automate
design and verification at the system level

     logic synthesis  after the designer is satisfied with the rtl code a
logic synthesis program converts the rtl code into a logical diagram of the
chip related programs insert the circuitry that will be required to test the
chip after manufacture a gate level so called because it describes the
various logic blocks or gates required to implement the chip data file or
net list is produced in a growing number of designs the logic synthesis
phase is performed together with a portion of physical design this combined
process known as physical synthesis produces a file containing placed
gates which describes the logic blocks and includes information about where
they will be physically located or placed on a chip see discussion below
under current issues facing ic designers in a growing number of
systemonachip ics in which multiple functions previously captured on
multiple chips are combined in a single chip designers are increasingly
performing chip planning either before or in conjunction with logic
synthesis in chip planning the designer determines the location of the
functional blocks that will be captured on the systemonachip and plans the
principal wire connections between the blocks logic synthesis is then
performed more or less independently on each block before the blocks are
stitched back together

     high level verification  at this stage the designer uses simulation and
related programs to verify that the design and for the individual blocks
successfully perform the functions that the designer intended by feeding an
exhaustive array of potential inputs into a specialized program simulating
the functioning of the chip as designed and checking to confirm that the
outputs match what was expected other techniques which use advanced
mathematical calculations rather than simulation are also used the designer
also uses a timing analysis program to confirm that the chip as designed will
operate at the speed the designer intended

     physical design  if the designer is satisfied with the results of high
level verification the transistors and all of the wires connecting each one of
them are mapped out in a series of transformations that gradually gets more and
more detailed first the location on the chip die of each block of the chip is
finalized and the location of each transistor within each block is
determined  a process known as placement  then all of the connections
between the transistors are determined  a process known as routing the
result is one or more data files that can be read by physical verification
programs see below or by the equipment used to manufacture the chip

     physical verification  before sending the design data file to a chip
manufacturer for fabrication a further verification step is undertaken the
designer must confirm that the chip as placed and routed will
                                        3
page

operate at the speed anticipated during the logic design phase the designer
also must check for unintended electrical effects that may arise as a
consequence of placing certain portions of the chip or routing certain of its
wires too close together or in a bad position finally the designer must
verify that the final design complies with all of the design rules set forth by
the party that will manufacture the chip

     the foregoing discussion has been greatly simplified in the actual design
of a chip each of these steps has a number of different elements the steps or
the different elements within the steps may be undertaken in a different order
or repeated one to multiple times in any event if at any stage of the process
the chip does not perform as intended then the designer must go back one or
more steps to either redesign the rtl redesign the logic rerun the
verification or redo the physical design of the chip each iteration takes time
and the more time the process takes the more difficult it will be for the
designer to meet his or her timetomarket goals

current issues facing ic designers

     as chip technology continues to advance and particularly as the
stateoftheart in chip design moves to 018 micron and below synopsys
customers are facing a number of difficult design challenges

     timing closure  ensuring that a chip will run at the desired speed becomes
substantially more difficult as transistor sizes move to 018 micron and below
at larger transistor feature sizes ic designers could use standard estimates of
chip timing during the logic design phase and be confident that the timing
characteristics would be preserved through the physical design phase at 018
micron and below these estimates become more and more unreliable to address
this problem customers will increasingly need products referred to in the eda
industry as physical synthesis products that integrate logic design and
physical design synopsys physical synthesis solution takes physical design
information into account during logic design and produces a file containing
placed gates physical synthesis provides more accurate timing estimates at
the logic design phase greatly improving the correlation between original
timing estimates after logic design and timing results after physical design

     signal integrity closure  signal integrity refers to a variety of
electrical effects that can cause circuits to behave in undesirable ways the
electrical characteristics of ics of 013 micron and below cause previously
insignificant effects to become problematic these effects include crosstalk
voltage drop and electromigration crosstalk in particular is becoming a
major problem for advanced designs today in order to address signal integrity
problems designers need products that help them analyze prevent and repair
errors caused by signal integrity issues synopsys has added crosstalk analysis
to its primetime timing analysis product to aid designers in detecting
crosstalkinduced timing violations synopsys physical synthesis tools include
analysis prevention and repair features to achieve signal integrity closure
more quickly and reliably

     verification  verification is the process of ensuring at various stages
of the design process that a chip will perform as intended as the number of
transistors on a chip grows the verification problem grows geometrically in
fact with todays chips verification often takes up the single largest
proportion of the overall design process verification products must offer
customers a combination of speed accuracy and the ability to focus on the
portions of the chip most likely to cause problems

     designer productivity  historically finding hiring and retaining
qualified design engineers has been one of the most difficult problems that our
customers face without enough designers it is difficult for a company to meet
ambitious development schedules and to get its products to market in a timely
manner although hiring qualified designers has become less difficult in the
current economic environment the increase in ic complexity and time to market
pressures have resulted in a continuing emphasis on designer productivity for
eda companies this creates opportunities both in providing fullfeatured
integrated design flows that reduce the number of iterations required during
the design process and in offering predesigned preverified design building
blocks that can be reused in multiple designs

significant enhancements including improved optimization algorithms runtimes
and capacity over time synopsys expects that a significant portion of the
existing design compiler license base will be upgraded to physical compiler
discussed below although design compiler will continue to be an important
element in designers overall suite of design tools especially for performing
logic synthesis on nontimingcritical portions of a design

     physical synthesis unites logic synthesis placement and in the future
routing and links them together with common timing when used together the
physical synthesis suite of products provides customers with an integrated
design flow from register transfer level through placement and routing and
addresses the critical timing problems encountered in designing advanced ics and
systemsonachip

of a design before it is committed to the expensive and timeconsuming process
of ic fabrication and to assist in the testing of the chip after manufacturing

     during fiscal 2001 verification and test products accounted for 29 of the
companys revenues

     simulation and related products  simulation software exercises an ic
design by running it through a series of tests and comparing the actual outputs
from the design with the expected output as such simulation products are the
key products for functional verification the goal of simulation is to make sure
that the functionality of the design meets the original specifications of the
chip synopsys offers two products for highlevel simulation vcstm for
designs written in verilog one of the two principal languages and
sciroccotm for designs written in vhdl the other principal language
simulation products are distinguished principally by their runtime and
capacity  ie how fast they can fully simulate a proposed design and how
large a design they can handle the company is focused on providing the
industrys fastest and highestcapacity simulation technology and believes that
both vcs and scirocco are industry leaders in performance and capacity vcs is
supported by all major semiconductor manufacturers and many thirdparty eda
software providers

     in addition to focusing on building the fastest simulator synopsys is
focused on developing a suite of products that help simulation products work
smarter the company estimates that more time is spent in writing verification
testbenches than in creating the design description testbenches which create
stimuli for chips and check the results are used in conjunction with simulation
tools to verify that a design functions as expected synopsys provides software
that helps generate and manage testbenches as well as evaluate the effectiveness
of the simulation process verar is a tool that automates the design of
testbenches thereby offering the ic designer significant reductions in overall
design and verification time vera provides a highlevel language designed
specifically for verifying complex designs vera is integrated with the
companys other simulation products

     test automation  in order to meet todays stringent quality requirements
chips must pass through rigorous testing after manufacturing synopsys

the dft flow synopsys test methodology also includes software to facilitate the
failure diagnosis of chips after manufacturing test expediting the
timeconsuming and expensive postfabrication activities required to determine
the cause of manufacturing defects

     static timing analysis  synopsys provides a complete tool suite to help
designers perform static timing analysis at the gate and transistor levels and
analyze signal integrity issues such as crosstalk synopsys gate level
analysis tool is called primetimer primetime is a fullchip gatelevel
static timing analysis tool targeted for complex multimillion gate designs
which is used by designers to verify at various stages of the design process
the speed at which a design will operate when it is fabricated primetimes
analysis of a designs speed is accepted as a sign off tool by virtually all
major semiconductor manufacturers which means that they accept its analysis as
determinative synopsys transistorlevel timing analysis products are described
below under transistor level design in fiscal 2001 synopsys extended
primetimes capabilities with the introduction of primetimesi which analyzes
the effect of crosstalk on timing an increasingly important issue at chip
geometries below 018 micron

     formal verification  equivalence checking  formal verification is a
method for comparing two versions of a design to determine if they are
equivalent usually an rtl version of the design is validated using simulation
and other dynamic verification tools establishing it as the golden version
subsequent versions ie after each step of the design process are then
compared to the golden version using mathematical algorithms to determine if
they are functionally equivalent the use of formal verification greatly reduces
the need to perform simulation which is substantially more timeconsuming at
each stage of the design process thus potentially saving a significant amount
of time in the overall design process synopsys formal verification product is
formalityr formality was one of the industrys first commercial equivalency
checkers to employ a multisolver architecture which enables the verification
of complex multimilliongate systemonachip designs in days or minutes

  intellectual property ip and systems level design

     the companys ip and systems level design products include our designware
ip library and systems design and verification products

     during fiscal 2001 ip and systems level design products accounted for 12
of the companys revenues

     intellectual property products  as ic designs continue to grow in size
reusing design blocks is becoming a more important method for reducing overall
design cycle time by reusing portions of a design and particularly those that
implement basic or standardized functions a company can let its ic design team
focus on designing the chip features that will give its product a competitive
advantage it can also reduce its verification risk by ensuring that these
portions of the chip are of high quality enabling reuse of intellectual
property ip requires a significant methodology shift from traditional ic
design in the past designs were intimately tied to a particular semiconductor
process technology or design methodology making reuse of design blocks from one
chip design to the next both difficult and costly

     synopsys designwarer product provides ic designers with a single library
of predesigned and preverified synthesizable ip cores as well as over 18500
verification ip models the synthesizable ip cores range in complexity from
simple adders and multipliers to pcix and usb20 cones the verification ip
models range in complexity from standard 74xx ttl parts to models of complex bus
interface protocols these models support all major eda simulation environments
and a wide range of eda platforms giving designers access to a broad range of
models to assist them with verification of their designs

     to meet the new challenges of soc designs in 2001 synopsys announced its
star ip program in which designware users can gain access to popular
microprocessors from mips technologies infineon technologies nec and other
providers in addition during 2002 the company expects to add a complete amba
onchipbus to designware

different vendors and the virtual socket interface alliance vsia an industry
group formed to promote standards that facilitate the integration and reuse of
functional blocks of intellectual property

     synopsys tapin program provides interface standards to all companies
through an open source licensing model interface formats and reference
implementations such as parsers and screeners are available to everyone at no
cost through the internet synopsys manages changes and enhancements that come
from the community of licensees the open source standards and reference
implementations are used by synopsys other eda companies and eda customers to
interface tools with each other to produce flexible design flows the standards
provided by synopsys as open sources include liberty for library modeling sdc
for design constraints and openvera for hardware verification

     systemc an open industry standard language is discussed above under
intellectual property and systems products

     synopsys products are written mainly in the c and c languages and
utilize industry standards for graphical user interfaces synopsys software
runs under unix operating systems such as solaris and hpux and most products
also run on the open source linux operating system synopsys products are
offered on the most widely used hardware platforms including those from sun
microsystems hewlettpackard ibm and intel microprocessorbased pcs

sales distribution and backlog

     synopsys markets its products and services primarily through its direct
sales and application service forces in the united states and principal
international markets synopsys employs highly skilled engineers and technically
proficient sales persons in order to understand our customers needs and to
explain and demonstrate the value of synopsys products

     for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 international sales represented 37 42
and 34 respectively of synopsys total revenue additional information
relating to domestic and foreign operations is contained in note 8 of notes to

sweden taiwan and the united kingdom including international headquarters
offices in ireland on a very limited basis the company also utilizes
manufacturers representatives and distributors the companys offices are
further described under item 2  properties

     synopsys backlog on december 1 2001 was approximately 8027 million
compared to approximately 4628 million on december 1 2000

     this backlog consists of orders for system and software products sold under
perpetual and timebased licenses with customer requested ship dates within
three months which have not been shipped orders for customer training and
consulting services which are expected to be completed within one year and
subscription services maintenance and support with contract periods extending
up to fifteen months in the case of a technology subscription license tsl
including a multiyear tsl backlog includes the full amount of the committed
noncancelable order less any amount of revenue that has been recognized on
such tsl

     the company has not historically experienced significant cancellations of
orders customers frequently reschedule or revise the requested ship dates of
orders however which can have the effect of deferring recognition of revenue
for these orders beyond the expected time period

research and development

     the companys future performance depends in large part on its ability to
maintain and enhance its current product lines develop new products maintain
technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer
requirements in addition to research and development conducted within each
business unit the company maintains an advanced research group that is
responsible for exploring new directions and applications of its core
technologies migrating new technologies into the existing product lines and
maintaining strong research relationships outside the company within both
industry and academia

     during fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 research and development expenses net
of capitalized software development costs were 1898 million 1893 million
and 1671 million respectively synopsys capitalized software development
costs of approximately 10 million 10 million and 09 million in fiscal
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the company anticipates that it will continue
to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future

manufacturing

     synopsys manufacturing operations consist of assembling testing
packaging and shipping its system and software products and documentation needed
to fulfill each order manufacturing is currently performed in synopsys
mountain view california and dublin ireland facilities outside vendors
provide cdrom replication printing of documentation and manufacturing of
packaging materials synopsys typically ships its software products within 10
days of acceptance of customer purchase orders and execution of software license
agreements unless the customer has requested otherwise upon customer request
synopsys delivers its software products through electronic means rather than
shipping disks this method of delivery is becoming increasingly common for
customers worldwide

     synopsys employees manufacture and test the hardware modeling system
products with most subassembly performed by outside vendors for its hardware
modeling products synopsys buys components and assemblies in anticipation of
orders and configures units to match orders typically shipping within one to
ten weeks of order acceptance unless the customer has requested otherwise

competition

     the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda
vendors and with customers internally developed design tools and internal
design capabilities for a share of the overall eda budgets of our potential
customers in general competition is based on product quality and features
postsale support price and as discussed below the ability to offer a
complete design flow our competitors include companies that offer a broad range
of products and services such as cadence design systems inc avant and
mentor
                                        12

graphics corporation as well as companies including numerous startup
companies that offer products focused on a discrete phase of the integrated
circuit design process in certain situations synopsys competitors have been
offering aggressive discounts on certain of their products in particular
simulation and synthesis products as a result average prices for these
products may fall in order to compete successfully we must continue to enhance
our products and bring to market new products that address the needs of our
customers we also will have to expand our consulting services business the
failure to enhance existing products develop andor acquire new products or
expand our ability to offer consulting services could have a material adverse
effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

     technology advances and customer requirements continue to fuel a change in
the nature of competition among eda vendors increasingly eda companies compete
on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical design
products rather than on the basis of individual point tools performing a
discrete phase of the design process a number of companies including cadence
avant magma design synplicity and monterey design are developing or selling
products that link logic and physical design the need to offer such design flow
synthesis products will become increasingly important as ics grow more complex
in fiscal 2001 we announced new products that would extend our design flow
through physical design and begin working with target customers to prepare such
products for broader release if we are unsuccessful in developing a complete
design flow on a timely basis or in convincing customers to adopt our integrated
logical and physical design products and methodology our competitive position
could be significantly weakened

product sales and licensing agreements

     synopsys typically licenses its software to customers under nonexclusive
license agreements that transfer title to the media only and that restrict use
of the software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas the
company currently licenses the majority of its software as a network license
that allows a number of individual users to access the software on a defined
network license fees are dependent on the type of license product mix and
number of copies of each product licensed

     synopsys currently offers its software products under either a perpetual
license or a shortterm ratable license under a perpetual license a customer
pays a onetime license fee for the right to use the software the vast majority
of customers buying perpetual licenses also purchase annual software support
services for perpetual licenses under which they receive minor enhancements to
the products developed during the year bug fixes and technical assistance a
ratable license and the various forms of timebased licenses that the company
has offered before introducing ratable licenses operates like a rental of
software which typically includes software support services a customer pays a
fee for license and support over a fixed period of time and at the end of the
time period the license expires unless the customer pays for a renewal ratable
licenses are offered with a range of terms the average length is approximately
30 to 35 years see managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations  results of operations  revenue

     over the past several years orders for timebased licenses now ratable
licenses have increased significantly as a percentage of total product orders
during fiscal 2001 orders for timebased licenses including ratable licenses
accounted for 86 of total product orders compared to 74 in fiscal 2000 and 64
in fiscal 1999

     during fiscal 2002 synopsys expects that orders for ratable licenses will
account for approximately 75 to 85 of total product orders and orders for
perpetual licenses approximately 15 to 25 of total product orders

     synopsys offers its hardware modeler products for sale or lease

proprietary rights

     the company primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent
trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to
establish and protect proprietary rights in its products the source code for
synopsys products is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished
copyrighted work

                                        13

however it may be possible for third parties to develop similar technology
independently in addition effective copyright and trade secret protection may
be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries the company currently
holds us and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in its
products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future

     although the company believes that its products trademarks and other
proprietary rights do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties
there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against
the company in the future or that any such claims will not require the company
to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly and timeconsuming
litigation

employees

     as of november 3 2001 synopsys had a total of 3223 employees of whom
2351 were based in north america and 872 were based internationally synopsys
future financial results depend in part upon the continued service of its key
technical and senior management personnel and its continuing ability to attract
and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel competition for
such personnel is intense our success is dependent on technical and other
contributions of key employees we participate in a dynamic industry with
significant startup activity and our headquarters is in silicon valley where
skilled technical sales and management employees are in high demand there are
a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers and the competition
for such individuals is intense experience at synopsys is highly valued in the
eda industry and the general electronics industry and our employees are
recruited aggressively by our competitors and by startup companies in many
industries in the past we have experienced and may continue to experience
significant employee turnover there can be no assurance that synopsys can
retain its key managerial and technical employees or that it can attract
assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel
in the future none of synopsys employees is represented by a labor union
synopsys has not experienced any work stoppages and considers its relations with
its employees to be good

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

     the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements within the
meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 for example
statements including terms such as projects expects believes
anticipates or targets are forwardlooking statements actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in such forwardlooking statements as a
result of certain factors including those set forth under factors that may
affect future results

results of operations

     introduction of technology subscription licenses tsls  on july 31 2000
we introduced tsls which are timelimited rights to use our software since
tsls include bundled product and services both product and service revenue is
generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or if later as
payments become due the terms of tsls and the payments due thereon may be
structured flexibly to meet the needs of the customer with minor exceptions
under tsls customers cannot obtain major new products developed or acquired
during the term of their license without making an additional purchase overall
we believe that tsls have enabled us to i offer customers technology and terms
that more closely match their needs ii have greater visibility into our
earnings stream iii more effectively resist customer requests for special
endofthequarter discounts and iv roll out our new technologies in a more
planned manner

     the replacement of the prior form of timebased licenses by tsls has
impacted and will continue to impact our reported revenue under a ratable
license relatively little revenue is recognized during the quarter the product
is delivered the remaining amount is recorded as deferred revenue to the extent
that the license fee has been paid or invoiced to be recognized over the term
of the license or is considered backlog by the company this backlog is not
recorded on our balance sheet under the prior form of timebased licenses a
high proportion of all license revenue was recognized in the quarter that the
product was delivered with relatively little recorded as deferred revenue or as
backlog therefore an order for a tsl will result in significantly lower
currentperiod revenue than an equalsized order under the prior form of
timebased license

     we set revenue targets for any given period based in part upon an
assumption that we will achieve a certain license mix of perpetual licenses and
tsls the actual mix of licenses sold affects the revenue we recognize in the
period if we are unable to achieve our target license mix we may not meet our
revenue targets in fiscal 2001 our license mix for new orders was 80 tsls and
20 perpetual licenses which is within our targeted range the average term of
our tsl licenses sold in 2001 was between 30 and 35 years which is longer
than expected given the difference in the revenue profile of tsls and perpetual
licenses this shift in license mix will reduce revenue in the shortterm we
anticipate that our license mix for fiscal 2002 will be approximately 15 to 25
perpetual licenses and 75 to 85 tsls

     business combinations and divestitures  on january 4 2001 we sold the
assets of our silicon libraries business to artisan components inc artisan
for a total sales price of 155 million including common stock with a fair
value on the date of sale of 114 million and cash of 41 million the net
book value of the assets sold was 14 million expenses incurred in connection
with the sale were 35 million we recorded a gain on the sale of the business
of 106 million which is included in other income net direct revenue for the

     there were no business combinations completed in fiscal 2001

     in fiscal 2000 we acquired i virsim a software product from innoveda
inc for a purchase price of approximately 70 million in cash ii the
silicon group inc a privately held provider of integrated circuit design and
intellectual property integration services for a purchase price of 30
million including cash payments of 18 million and a reserve of approximately
34000 shares of common stock for issuance under the silicon groups stock
option plan which was assumed in the transaction and iii leda sa leda a
privately held provider of rtl codingstylecheckers for a purchase price of
77 million including cash payments of 75 million approximately 17
million of the leda purchase price was allocated to inprocess research and
development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses the purchase
price of each of these transactions was allocated to the acquired assets and
liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the
respective acquisition amounts allocated to developed technology workforce and
goodwill are being amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging from
three to five years

     in fiscal 1999 we issued approximately 14 million shares of common stock
for all the outstanding stock of everest a developer of integrated circuit
routing and related technology and reserved approximately 120000 shares of
common stock for issuance under everests stock option plan which we assumed in
the transaction the business combination was accounted for as a pooling of
interests and accordingly our consolidated financial statements have been
restated to include the financial position and results of everest for all
periods prior to the merger date

     in fiscal 1999 we acquired i gambit automated design inc gambit a
privately held provider of place and route software and physical design services
for a purchase price of 413 million including 292 million in cash 80
million in notes payable and a reserve of approximately 78000 shares of common

and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had
not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses were
i 139 million for gambit ii 41 million for stanza iii 24 million
for covermeter and iv 08 million for apteq the purchase price of each of
the transactions was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on
their estimated fair values as of the date of the respective acquisition
amounts allocated to developed technology workforce and goodwill are being
amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging from three to five
years

     revenue  revenue consists of fees for perpetual and ratable licenses of
the companys software products sales of hardware system products
postcontract customer support pcs customer training and consulting we
classify revenues as product service or ratable license product revenue
consists primarily of perpetual and nonratable timebased license revenue
service revenue consists of pcs under perpetual and nonratable timebased
licenses and fees for consulting services and training ratable license revenue
consists of revenue from tsls and from timebased licenses that include extended
payment terms or unspecified additional products

     revenue for fiscal 2001 decreased 13 to 6804 million as compared to
7838 million for fiscal 2000 consistent with our expectations the decrease
in revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 is due to the utilization
                                        19
page

for the full 2001 fiscal year of the ratable license model and the related
inherent decrease in revenue due to the timing of revenue recognition under this
license model

     product revenue decreased by 62 to 1639 million in fiscal 2001 from
4341 million in fiscal 2000 and decreased by 14 from 5058 million in fiscal
1999 compared to fiscal 2000 the decrease in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 is
primarily due to the change in the license model to tsls for which revenue is
recognized ratably over the term of the license

     service revenue consists of consulting revenue training and pcs on
perpetual licenses service revenue remained relatively flat at 3418 million
in fiscal 2001 compared to 3408 million in fiscal 2000 service revenue in the
first half of fiscal 2001 was 1785 million compared to 1681 million for the
same period in fiscal 2000 this 6 increase was a result of increased sales of
our turnkey design and wireless and broadband consulting services however full
fiscal year 2001 services revenue was impacted by costcutting efforts by
customers during the second half of the fiscal year which led to rescheduling
of delivery dates on certain consulting projects and cancellation of others as
a result projects anticipated to produce revenue in the second half of fiscal
2001 were not completed assuming no improvement in the current economic
climate the company anticipates that customers will continue to review their
engagements with outside consultants and may eliminate or defer those
determined to be noncritical during fiscal 2000 service revenue increased by
13 from 3003 million in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 2000 this increase
was primarily attributable to the renewal of maintenance and support contracts
for eda products and growth in customer training and consulting services

     over time service revenue will be impacted by three trends first new
licenses are increasingly structured as tsls including the bundled pcs second
customers with existing perpetual licenses are increasingly entering into new
tsls rather than renewing the pcs on the existing perpetual license third
customers with existing perpetual licenses are increasingly converting their
existing licenses to tsls each of these trends will result over time in lower
service revenue

     ratable license revenue was 1746 million for fiscal 2001 and 89 million
for fiscal 2000 during fiscal 2001 ratable revenue equaled 310 million
389 million 498 million and 549 million for the first second third and
fourth quarters of 2001 respectively increasing on a sequential quarter basis
in each quarter of the year we expect sequential increases to continue through
fiscal 2002

     revenue from international operations was 2539 million 3270 million
and 2752 million or 37 42 and 34 of total revenue in fiscal 2001 2000
and 1999 respectively in any given period the geographic mix of revenue is
influenced by the particular contracts closed during that quarter although the
fluctuation on geographical mix should become less pronounced as the ratable
revenue model continues to phase in the decline in international revenues from
fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 is due to a decline in the revenue contribution from
japan the increase in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue in
fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily a result of relatively greater
revenue growth in japan

     revenue expectations  during fiscal 2002 we expect revenue to consist of
approximately 20 perpetual licenses 40 tsls and 40 services due to the
current economic environment we do not currently have sufficient visibility
into revenues for the full fiscal 2002 year to be able to forecast such full
year revenues with
                                        20

a reasonable accuracy these expectations do not take into account the potential
impact of the proposed mergers with avant inc and ikos systems inc

     ic implementation  ic implementation includes two product categories the
design compiler dc family and physical synthesis the dc family includes
design compiler our core logic synthesis product power compiler which permits
optimization of the design of low power circuits and module compiler which is
used in the design of complex datapaths

     quarterly revenue from the dc family has increased since the introduction
of our ratable license model from 447 million in the fourth quarter of 2000
to 580 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 this increase is driven by a
continued increase in revenues from design compiler as a percentage of total
revenue the dc family has remained relatively flat over the last five quarters
ranging from 32 to 34 while we expect the relative revenue contribution from
the dc family to decline over time as our customers transition from the dc
family products to physical synthesis products design compiler remains one of
our topselling products

     included in the physical synthesis family is physical compiler a product
that unifies synthesis placement and global routing chip architect a chip
floorplanning product and our detailed routing technology during the fourth
quarter of 2001 we announced our route compiler and clocktree compiler
products quarterly revenue from this product family has increased sequentially
over the last five quarters with the exception of the first quarter of 2001 the
overall increase in quarterly sales is related primarily to an increase in
revenues from physical compiler the decrease in revenue in the first quarter of
2001 compared to the fourth quarter of 2000 is due to the mix of license types
sold in the quarter specifically fewer perpetual licenses were sold in that
quarter compared to the preceding and following quarters

     verification and test  verification and test includes our simulation
timing analysis formal verification and test products revenue has increased in
each quarter since the introduction of our ratable license model these
sequential increases are primarily due to growth in revenue for our verilog
simulator vcs and prime time

     intellectual property ip and systems products  our ip and systems
products group includes the designware library of design components and
verification models and system design products revenue increased sequentially
from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 through the third quarter of fiscal 2001
primarily due to increased designware revenue in the first quarter of fiscal
2001 we sold our silicon libraries business which contributed direct revenue
of 02 million and 05 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 and the

                                        21
page

fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 respectively during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001 there was a decrease in revenue as compared to the third quarter of fiscal
2001 from our designware product of approximately 10 million due to an
increase in the average term of the subscription or ratable licenses in fiscal
2001 in comparison to fiscal 2000 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we
also discontinued our eagle product which in fiscal 2001 and 2000 contributed
direct revenue of 24 million and 33 million respectively

     transistor level design  our transistor level design product group
includes tools that are used in transistorlevel simulation and analysis
revenue in total and as a percent of total company revenue from this product
group has fluctuated since the introduction of tsls as a result of the mix of
license types of orders received the decline in the fourth quarter is due
primarily to an increase in the percentage of ratable licenses during the fourth
quarter as compared to the third quarter

     professional services  the professional services group includes consulting
and training this group provides consulting services including design
methodology assistance specialized telecommunications systems design services
and turnkey design revenue from professional services increased quarterly from
the fourth quarter of 2000 through the second quarter of 2001 as a result of
increased sales of our turnkey design and wireless and broadband consulting
services however in the third quarter of 2001 revenue from professional
services declined 23 in comparison to the previous quarter and decreased an
additional 3 in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to the third quarter
these decreases in service revenue in the second half of fiscal 2001 are the
result of certain consulting projects which were not completed as delivery
dates were pushed out to future periods or canceled by customers this was
caused by the tightening economy due to the current economic climate customers
may continue to reduce costs cancel orders or extend the delivery dates on
existing purchase orders

     cost of revenue  cost of product revenue includes personnel and related
costs production costs product packaging documentation amortization of
capitalized software development costs and purchased technology and costs of
the components of the our hardware system products the cost of internally
developed capitalized software is amortized based on the greater of the ratio of
current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue
or the straightline method over the softwares estimated economic life of
approximately two years cost of product revenue was 12 of total product
revenue for fiscal 2001 as compared to 8 for fiscal 2000 this increase in
cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue is due
primarily to the writeoff of certain eagle intangible assets totaling 18
million and an increase in the inventory reserve totaling 13 million related
to our hardware modeling product because we are transitioning customers to the
next generation product the companys product costs are relatively fixed and do
not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or changes in revenue
recognition methods cost of product revenue was 7 of total product revenue for
fiscal 1999

     cost of service revenue includes consulting services personnel and the
related costs associated with providing training and pcs on perpetual licenses
cost of service revenue as a percentage of total service revenue has remained
relatively flat at 23 in fiscal 2001 24 in fiscal 2000 and 23 in 1999

     since tsls include bundled product and services cost of ratable license
revenue includes the costs of product and services related to our tsls cost of
ratable license revenue was 17 for fiscal 2001

     because cost of product and tsl revenue is based on the mix of orders as
customers migrate to the tsl model cost of product revenue will decrease as a
percentage of total revenues over time as more tsl deferred revenue is
amortized cost of tsl revenue will also decrease as a percentage of revenue
during fiscal 2002 we expect that the cost of product revenue as a percent of
total product revenue will remain flat and the cost of tsl revenue as a percent
of total tsl revenue will either remain flat or decrease slightly the cost of
service revenue as a percent of the related revenue is also expected to remain
relatively flat or decrease slightly

     research and development  research and development expenses net of
capitalized software development costs in terms of annual spending remained
relatively flat at 1898 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 1893 million in
fiscal 2000 and increased by 13 in fiscal 2000 compared to 1671 million in
fiscal 1999 the change in absolute dollars between 2001 and 2000 reflects
increases in personnel related costs recruiting

                                        22

costs and depreciation expense offset by a decrease in facilities due to certain
facilities which were acquired in the gambit acquisition and closed during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 as well as decreases in equipment repairs
advertising expenses and travel and entertainment costs research and
development expenses represented 28 24 and 21 of total revenue in fiscal
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the increase in research and development
expenses as a percentage of total revenue is due to the decrease in total
revenues as a result of a change in our license model the increase in research
and development spending in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was due
primarily to increases in personnel and related costs as a result of business
combinations and higher levels of research and development staffing in support
of our rollout of physical compiler in each year additions of personnel were
made to facilitate the enhancement of existing applications and development of
new products we believe that to maintain our competitive position in a market
characterized by rapid rates of technological advancement we must continue to
invest significant resources in new systems and software and continue to
enhance existing products we anticipate that we will continue to commit
substantial resources to research and development in the future if we determine
that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner we may
license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an
alternative to internal research and development

     sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses decreased by 5 to
2740 million in fiscal 2001 from 2888 million in fiscal 2000 and increased
by 20 from 2414 million in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 2000 total
expenses decreased in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 primarily as a
result of decreases in annual bonuses travel consulting expenses recruiting
advertising and depreciation expense offset by increases in personnelrelated
costs sales and marketing expenses represented 40 37 and 30 of total
revenue in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively sales and marketing
expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a decrease in total
revenue as a result of the change in our license model total expenses increased
in absolute dollars in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 primarily as a result
of an increase in sales commissions and bonus costs

     general and administrative  general and administrative expenses increased
18 to 697 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 592 million in fiscal 2000
general and administrative expense increased from 472 million in fiscal 1999
compared to fiscal 2000 general and administrative expenses increased during
fiscal 2001 due to increases in bad debt expense facility expenditures and
consulting services related to the upgrade of our current computer systems
offset by a decrease in personnel costs as a percentage of total revenue
general and administrative expenses were 10 8 and 6 in fiscal 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively the increase in general and administrative expenses
increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a decrease in total revenue as
a result of the change to our license model in fiscal 2000 the increase in
absolute dollars and percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily
due in part to increases in order of magnitude in personnel costs an increase
in bad debt expense relating to the accounts receivable allowance provided in
accordance with our historical trends facility expenditures and patent and
proxy services

     operating expense targets  fiscal 2002  as a result of our costcutting
measures implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and affecting expense
levels in fiscal 2002 we expect that total operating expenses for the full
fiscal year 2002 will be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2001 levels

     amortization of intangible assets  intangible assets represent the excess
of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible assets and
other identifiable intangible assets acquired by the company goodwill under
our accounting policies intangible assets as of october 31 2001 including
goodwill are being amortized over the estimated useful life of three to five
years amortization of intangible assets charged to operations amounted to 170
million 151 million and 79 million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively

     we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for indications of
impairment if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset
may be impaired an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value
of the asset over its remaining useful life is made if this evaluation
indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows of the entity or technology acquired over the
remaining amortization period the net carrying value of the related intangible
asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be
adjusted in fiscal 2001 we recognized an aggregate

                                        23
page

impairment charge of 22 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible
assets associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value
approximately 18 million and 04 million are included in cost of revenues and
amortization of intangible assets respectively on the statement of operations
the impairment charge is attributable to certain technology acquired from and
goodwill related to the acquisition of eagle design automation inc in 1997
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we determined that we would not
allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology and
we do not anticipate any future sales of the product there were no impairments
of intangible assets in fiscal 2000 and 1999

     inprocess research and development  the following paragraphs contain
forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities

begin generating benefits from projects expected product capabilities and
product life cycles costs and efforts to complete projects growth rates
royalty rates and projected revenue and expense information used by us to

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
predicted in any such forwardlooking statement

     purchased inprocess research and development iprd of 17 million and
212 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively represent the writeoff of
inprocess technologies associated with our acquisitions of leda in fiscal 2000
and gambit stanza covermeter and apteq in fiscal 1999 at the date of each
acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached
technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no
alternative future uses accordingly these amounts were expensed on the
respective acquisition dates of each of the acquired companies also see note
3 business combinations of notes to synopsys consolidated financial
statements

     valuation of iprd  we calculated amounts allocated to iprd using
established valuation techniques in the high technology industry and expensed
such amounts in the quarter that each acquisition was consummated because
technological feasibility had not been achieved and no alternative future uses
had been identified in each of the acquisitions that had associated significant
iprd charges during fiscal 2000 and 1999 the valuation of iprd was determined
as discussed in the next three paragraphs information specific to the
significant iprd charges in 2000 and 1999 follows

     the value assigned to acquired inprocess technology was determined by
identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility
had not been established the value of inprocess technology was then segmented
into two classifications i inprocess technology  completed and ii in
process technology  tobecompleted giving explicit consideration to the
value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business
prior to the date of acquisition and to be created by synopsys after the
acquisition these value creation efforts were estimated by considering the
following major factors i timebased data ii costbased data and iii
complexitybased data

     the value of the inprocess technology was determined using a discounted
cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the incomeproducing
capabilities of the inprocess technologies under this approach the value is
determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the
identified products within the classification segments revenue estimates were
based on i individual product revenues ii anticipated growth rates iii
anticipated product development and introduction schedules iv product sales
cycles and v the estimated life of a products underlying technology from
the revenue estimates operating expense estimates including costs of sales
general and administrative selling and marketing income taxes and a use charge
for contributory assets were deducted to arrive at operating income revenue
growth rates were estimated by management for each product and gave
consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors expected industry
trends the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and
our competitors individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each
products underlying technology operating expense estimates reflect our
historical expense ratios additionally these projects will require continued
research and development after they have reached a state of technological and
commercial feasibility the resulting operating income stream was discounted to
reflect its present value at the date of the

                                        24
page

acquisition these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of
the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from
these estimates will not occur or that we will realize any anticipated benefits
of the acquisition

     the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess
technology is our weighted average cost of capital wacc taking into account
our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the
enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue
estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of
such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the
uncertainty of technological advances all of which are unknown at this time

     gambit  in march 1999 the company acquired gambit upon consummation of
the gambit acquisition we immediately recognized expense of 139 million
representing the acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the date of the
acquisition the principal inprocess technologies identified were gambits
integrated circuit routing and clock tree synthesis cts technologies both of
which are related to the physical design of integrated circuits for purposes of
valuing the iprd in accordance with the methodology discussed above the
following estimates were used revenue growth ranging from 57 in year two to 9
in year five cost of sales  20 of revenue in each year general and
administrative expenses  18 of revenue in each year and sales and
marketing  21 of revenue in each year in addition it was assumed there
would be no expense reduction due to economic synergies as a result of the
acquisition the rate used to discount the net cash flows from the gambit
purchased inprocess technology was 25 the technologies were approximately 75
complete at the acquisition date the nature of the efforts to complete these
projects related in varying degrees to the completion of all planning
designing prototyping verification and testing activities that are necessary
to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications
including functional technical and economic performance requirements the
acquired inprocess technologies were originally anticipated to become
commercially viable in fiscal 1999 and 2000 expenditures to complete the
acquired inprocess technologies were expected to total approximately 32
million

     subsequent to the date of the acquisition we determined that the
inprocess technologies acquired would be more commercially viable if they were
integrated with our existing products and technologies in development our
decision to integrate the acquired inprocess technologies rather than selling
them as stand alone products is the result of changes in technology in the
industry development of our strategy for entering the market for physical
design software and market forces we have incurred research and development
expenses of approximately 84 million directly related to the acquired and
enhanced technologies we introduced routing and cts products integrating the
acquired inprocess technology to a limited number of customers in fiscal 2001
and expect general release of these products in fiscal 2002 the anticipated
incremental revenue contribution from the enhanced technology and the related
costs including cost of sales and incremental general and administrative and
sales and marketing costs are being evaluated based on current customer
analysis however we expect the revenue and the costs related to this product
to be consistent with the valuation assumptions noted above

     the risks associated with this research and development are still
considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will meet
market expectations if these projects are not successfully developed future
revenue and profitability of the acquired gambit business may be materially
adversely affected additionally the value of other intangible assets acquired
may become impaired as evidenced by its continued support for these projects
management believes that we will successfully complete each of the major gambit
research and development programs

     we obtained a second inprocess routing technology from gambit this
technology has not been further developed except to the extent necessary to
service former gambit customers using prior versions of the technology the
postacquisition research and development costs have not been materially in
excess of those anticipated at the acquisition date

     during fiscal 2000 and 1999 we made other acquisitions resulting in
aggregate iprd charges of 17 million and 73 million respectively none of
which were individually material to the results of our
                                        25
page

operations in the respective year the fair value of the related iprd was
determined in a manner substantially similar to that described for gambit the
risks associated with this acquired research and development are considered high
and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit to us
or meet market expectations

     other income net  other income net was 838 million 408 million and
370 million or 12 5 and 5 of total revenue in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively the increase for fiscal 2001 is due in part to an increase in
realized gains on investments which were 553 million for fiscal 2001 as
compared to 130 million for fiscal 2000 in part to the receipt of rental
income of 86 million in fiscal 2001 as compared to zero for fiscal 2000 and
in part to the gain of 106 million on the sale of our silicon libraries
business to artisan these gains were partially offset by the writedown of
certain assets in our venture portfolio in the amount of 58 million for fiscal
2001 and a lower level of interest income in fiscal 2001 of 128 million
compared to 281 million in fiscal 2000 the decrease in interest income
primarily reflects our lower average cash balances which resulted from the
continuation of our stock repurchase programs and the decision to grant extended
payment terms on more revenue contracts in fiscal 2001 other income net
increased from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000 from a higher mix of higher yield
taxable to taxexempt investments in fiscal 2000 in addition in fiscal 2000
other income net increased in comparison to fiscal 1999 due to gains realized
on sales of equity investments

     for fiscal 2002 we expect other income and expense to be between 27
million and 33 million including approximately 16 million from the sale of
investments held by the company

     during the year ended october 31 2001 we determined that certain of the
assets held in our venture fund with an aggregate value of 94 million were
impaired and that the impairment was other than temporary accordingly we
recorded a charge of approximately 58 million to write down the carrying value
of the investments the impairment charge is included in other income net the
impairment charge relates to certain investments in nonpublic companies and
represents managements estimate of the impairment incurred during the period as
a result of specific analysis of each investment considering the activities of
and events occurring at each of the underlying portfolio companies during the
quarter our portfolio companies operate in industries that are rapidly evolving
and extremely competitive for equity investments in nonpublic companies for
which there is not a market in which their value is readily determinable we
review each investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis based
primarily on achievement of business plan objectives and current market
conditions among other factors the primary business plan objectives we
consider include among others those related to financial performance such as
achievement of planned financial results or completion of capital raising
activities and those that are not primarily financial in nature such as the
introduction of technology or the hiring of key employees on a timely basis if
it is determined that an impairment has occurred with respect to an investment
in a portfolio company in the absence of quantitative valuation metrics
management estimates the impairment andor the net realizable value of the
portfolio investment based on public and privatecompany market comparable
information and valuations completed for companies similar to our portfolio
companies

     interest rate risk  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest
rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes with
respect to our cash and shortterm investments we place our investments in a
mix of taxexempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality
standards as specified in our investment policy the policy also limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of instrument we do
not anticipate any material losses due to this risk with respect to our
investment portfolio

     foreign currency risk  at the present time we do not generally hedge
anticipated foreign currency cash flows but hedge only those currency exposures
associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional
currencies hedging activities undertaken are intended to offset the impact of
currency fluctuations on these balances the success of this activity depends
upon estimates of balances denominated in various currencies and foreign
currency fluctuations at october 31 2001 we have forward contracts for the
sale and purchase of foreign currencies with a notional value expressed in us
dollars of 722 million we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

these hedging transactions will be effective in the future

     derivative financial instruments  on november 1 2000 we adopted
statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 as amended sfas 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
activities sfas 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either
assets or liabilities at fair value derivatives that are not designated as
hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings if the
                                        27

derivative is designated as a hedging instrument depending on the nature of the
exposure being hedged changes in fair value will either be offset against the
change in fair value of the hedged asset liability or firm commitment through
earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
anticipated transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the hedge
is recognized in earnings immediately upon adoption of sfas 133 the cumulative
transition adjustment was insignificant we do not believe that ongoing
application of sfas 133 will significantly alter our hedging strategies
however its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense
and other comprehensive income apart from our foreign currency hedging and
forward sales of certain equity investments we do not use derivative financial
instruments in particular we do not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes

     european monetary union  in january 1999 a new currency called the
european monetary unit or euro was introduced in certain economic and
monetary union emu countries during 2002 all emu countries are expected to
be operating with the euro as their single currency we have assessed the impact
the euro formation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our
products our international sales are based primarily in us dollars which is
not subject to the euro conversion while we do have some sales and operating
expenses denominated in the european currency unit this currency is
successfully being converted in the market to the new euro at parity in
addition we upgraded our internal computer systems to convert the european
currencies to the euro we expect no material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations due to the conversion to the
euro

proposed acquisition of ikos systems inc

     on july 2 2001 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and
reorganization the merger agreement with ikos systems inc ikos the
merger agreement provides for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of ikos
common stock by synopsys the merger is expected to be completed in august 2002
however under certain circumstances the merger may close prior to june 30
2002 we will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting

     upon completion of the merger holders of ikos common stock will be
entitled to receive synopsys common stock with a value between 6 and 20 in
exchange for each share of ikos common stock owned at the time of completion of
the merger the exact amount per share will depend upon the financial
performance of ikos during the 12month measurement period ending june 30 2002
and will be calculated based on formulas contained in the merger agreement the
formulas contained in the merger agreement provide for proportionate increases
in the purchase price per ikos share as ikos revenue revenue plus change in
backlog or profit loss before tax pbt each as defined in the merger
agreement increase if the merger closes before june 30 2002 the merger
agreement provides for holders of ikos common stock on the closing date to
receive synopsys common stock with a value of 15 for each share of ikos common
stock regardless of ikos financial performance up to the date of closing
regardless of when the merger closes the purchase price per ikos share is
subject to reduction if the number of outstanding ikos shares and options
immediately before the effective time of the merger exceeds an agreedupon
level however the purchase price per ikos share will not be less than 6

     the merger is subject to certain conditions including ikos achieving
revenue of at least 50 million and losses before tax not exceeding 10 million
during the twelvemonth period ending june 30 2002 expiration or termination
of a synopsys emulation noncompete agreement ikos stockholder approval
retention of certain employees compliance with regulatory requirements and
customary closing conditions

     the actual number of shares of synopsys common stock to be issued in the
merger and the aggregate purchase price at the effective time of the merger
cannot be determined until ikos financial performance during the measurement
period is calculated and until the average last sale price of synopsys common
stock during the applicable preclosing pricing period is determined

     on december 7 2001 mentor graphics corporation commenced a tender offer
for all shares of ikos common stock the offer is subject to numerous
conditions including the termination of the merger agreement the purported
terms and conditions of the offer are set forth in an offer to purchase filed by
mentor as part of a schedule to with the securities and exchange commission on
december 7 2001 and in
                                        28

certain amendments thereto filed by mentor with the sec thereafter ikos
response to the tender offer is set forth in a schedule 14d9 filed by ikos with
the securities and exchange commission on december 20 2001 and in certain
amendments thereto filed by ikos with the sec thereafter litigation relating to
ikos is discussed above under item 3

subsequent event  proposed acquisition of avant corporation

     on december 3 2001 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with
avant corporation avant by which avant will merge with and into a wholly
owned subsidiary of synopsys we will account for the merger under the purchase
method of accounting

     upon completion of the merger holders of avant common stock will be
entitled to receive 0371 of a share of synopsys common stock including the
associated preferred stock rights in exchange for each share of avant common
stock the exchange ratio owned at the time of completion of the merger the
exchange ratio will be proportionately adjusted for any stock split stock
dividend reorganization or similar change in avant common stock or synopsys
common stock avant stockholders will receive cash based on the market price of
synopsys common stock in lieu of any fractional shares to which they might
otherwise be entitled the merger is subject to certain conditions including
approval by the avant stockholders of the merger and the agreement and plan of
merger approval by synopsys stockholders of the issuance of synopsys common
stock in the merger compliance with regulatory requirements and customary
closing conditions

     the actual number of shares of synopsys common stock to be issued in the
proposed merger and the dollar value at the effective time of the merger cannot
be determined until the closing date of the merger

effect of new accounting standards

     in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statements of
financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations sfas 141 and
no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 sfas 141 requires that
the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations
initiated after june 30 2001 and specifies criteria intangible assets acquired
in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized apart from
goodwill sfas 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at
least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142

     we adopted the provisions of sfas 141 effective july 1 2001 under sfas
141 goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives
acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june 30 2001 but
before sfas 142 is adopted will not be amortized but will continue to be
evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas 121 goodwill and intangible
assets acquired in business combinations completed before july 1 2001 will
continue to be amortized and tested for impairment in accordance with current
accounting guidance until the date of adoption of sfas 142

     upon adoption of sfas 142 we will evaluate existing intangible assets and
goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations and make
any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in
sfas 142 for recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill upon adoption
of sfas 142 we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual
values of all intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization
period adjustments in addition we will be required to test intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives and goodwill for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of sfas 142 within the sixmonth period following adoption any
impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle any subsequent
impairment losses will be included in operating activities

     we expect to adopt sfas 142 on november 1 2002 as of october 31 2001
unamortized goodwill is 351 million which will no long be amortized
subsequent to the adoption of sfas 142 related goodwill amortization expense
for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 is 170 million 151 million and 79 million
respectively amortization expense for the onemonth transition period ended
october 31 1999 was 12 million because of the extensive effort needed to
comply with adopting sfas 141 and 142 it is not

                                        29
page

practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on
our financial statements at the date of this report including whether we will
be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses

liquidity and capital resources

     cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 4764 million at
october 31 2001 an increase of 432 million or 10 from october 31 2000
cash provided by operating activities was 2958 million for fiscal 2001
compared to 1527 million for fiscal 2000

     cash provided by investing activities was 618 million in fiscal 2001
compared to 456 million provided by investing activities during fiscal 2000
the increase in cash provided by investing activities of 162 million is due
primarily to net proceeds from the sale of short and longterm investments
totaling 1415 million for fiscal 2001 as compared to net proceeds of
investments totaling 1258 million for fiscal 2000 the cash received from the
sales of investments during fiscal 2001 was primarily used to purchase treasury
stock capital expenditures totaled 825 million during fiscal 2001 as we
continue to invest in fixed assets primarily related to construction of our
oregon facilities and computing equipment to upgrade our internal engineering
and enterprise application systems

     we used 2330 million in net cash for financing activities during 2001
compared to 3515 in fiscal 2000 the primary financing uses of cash during
2001 were the repurchase of 66 million shares of common stock for approximately
50 per share and payments on debt obligations totaling 65 million financing
proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to our employee stock plans during
fiscal 2001 were 1054 million compared to 595 million during fiscal 2000

     accounts receivable remained relatively flat from 1469 million at october
31 2000 to 1463 million at october 31 2001 days sales outstanding which is
calculated based on revenues for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable
as of the balance sheet decreased to 73 days as of october 31 2001 from 99 days
at october 31 2000 the decrease in days sales outstanding is the result of the
change in our license model resulting in scheduled billings over the life of the
contract for tsls whereas under the prior form of timebased licenses the
contract amount was typically billed upfront

     we believe that our current cash cash equivalents shortterm investments
and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at
least the next twelve months

factors that may affect future results

     weakness in the semiconductor and electronics businesses may negatively
impact synopsys business synopsys business depends on the semiconductor and
electronics businesses which in 2001 experienced their sharpest decline in
orders and revenue in over 20 years purchases of our products are largely
dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor
manufacturers and their customers the number of design engineers and the
increasing complexity of designs

     during 2001 many semiconductor and electronic companies cancelled or
deferred design projects and reduced their design engineering staffs which
respectively impacted our orders and revenues and particularly our professional
services business demand for our products and services may also be affected by
mergers in the semiconductor and systems industries which may reduce the
aggregate level of purchases of our products and services by the combined
company continuation or worsening of the current conditions in the
semiconductor industry and continued consolidation among our customers all
could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations

     synopsys revenue and earnings may fluctuate  many factors affect our
revenue and earnings which makes it difficult to achieve predictable revenue
and earnings growth among these factors are customer product and service
demand product license terms and the timing of revenue recognition on products
and

                                        30
page

services sold the following specific factors could affect our revenue and
earnings in a particular quarter or over several quarterly or annual periods

      our products are complex and before buying them customers spend a great
       deal of time reviewing and testing them our customers evaluation and
       purchase cycles do not necessarily match our quarterly periods in the
       past we have received a disproportionate volume of orders in the last
       week of a quarter in addition a large proportion of our business is
       attributable to our largest customers as a result if any order and
       especially a large order is delayed beyond the end of a fiscal period
       our orders for that period could be below our plan and our revenue could
       be below any targets we may have published

      accounting rules determine when revenue is recognized on our orders and
       therefore impact how much revenue we will report in any given fiscal
       period the authoritative literature under which synopsys recognizes
       revenue has been and is expected to continue to be the subject of much
       interpretative guidance in general after the adoption of tsls in the
       fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 most orders for our products and services
       yield revenue over multiple quarters or years or upon completion of
       performance rather than at the time the product is shipped for any given
       order however the specific terms agreed to with a customer may have the
       effect of requiring deferral or acceleration of revenue in whole or in
       part therefore for any given fiscal period it is possible for us to
       fall short in our revenue andor earnings plan even while orders and
       backlog remain on plan or conversely to meet or exceed our revenue
       andor earnings plan because of backlog and deferred revenue and the mix
       of orders during authorization period while aggregate orders are under
       plan

      our revenue and earnings targets are based in part upon an assumption
       that we will achieve a license mix of perpetual licenses on which
       revenue is generally recognized in the quarter shipped and tsls on which
       revenue is recognized over the term of license that includes 15 to 25
       perpetual licenses if we are unable to achieve a mix in this range our
       ability to achieve shortterm or longterm revenue andor earnings
       targets may be impaired

     synopsys may not be able to successfully compete in the eda industry  the
eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda vendors and
with customers internally developed design tools and internal design
capabilities for a share of the overall eda budgets of our potential customers
in general competition is based on product quality and features postsale
support price and as discussed below the ability to offer a complete design
flow our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and
services such as cadence design systems inc avant and mentor graphics
corporation as well as companies including numerous recentlypublic and
startup companies that offer products focused on a discrete phase of the
integrated circuit design process in certain situations synopsys competitors
have been offering aggressive discounts on certain of their products in
particular simulation and synthesis products as a result average prices for
these products may fall

     technology advances and customer requirements continue to fuel a change in
the nature of competition among eda vendors which could hurt synopsys ability
to compete  increasingly eda companies compete on the basis of design flows
involving integrated logic and physical design products referred to as
physical synthesis products rather than on the basis of individual point
tools performing a discrete phase of the design process the need to offer
physical synthesis products will become increasingly important as ics grow more
complex our physical synthesis products compete principally with products from
cadence and magma design automation both of which include more complete
physical design capabilities we are working on completing our design flow in
june we announced two physical design products and in december 2001 we
announced the avant merger however there can be no guarantee that we will be
able to offer a competitive complete design flow to customers as a result of
these efforts or the proposed avant merger if we are unsuccessful in
developing a complete design flow on a timely basis if the avant merger is not
completed or if we are unsuccessful in convincing customers to adopt our
integrated design flow our competitive position could be significantly
weakened

     synopsys revenue growth depends on new and nonsynthesis products which
may not be accepted in the marketplace  historically much of our growth has
been attributable to the strength of our logic synthesis products our dc family
of products accounted for 32 of revenue in fiscal 2001 we believe that orders
and
                                        31
page

revenue for our flagship logic synthesis product design compiler and the dc
family have peaked over the long term we expect the contribution from the dc
family to decline as our customers transition from dc family products to
physical synthesis products in order to meet our revenue plan aggregate
revenues products other than the dc family and from professional services must
grow faster than our overall revenue growth target if such revenue growth fails
to meet our goals it will be difficult for us to meet our overall revenue or
earnings targets

     in order to sustain revenue growth over the long term we will have to
enhance our existing products and introduce new products that are accepted by a
broad range of customers and to continue the growth in our consulting services
business product success is difficult to predict the introduction of new
products and growth of a market for such products cannot be assured in the past
we like all companies have introduced new products that have failed to meet
our revenue expectations expanding revenue from consulting services may be
difficult in the current economic environment it will require us to continue to
develop effective management controls on bidding and executing on consulting
engagements increasing consulting orders and revenue while maintaining an
adequate level of profit can be difficult there can be no assurance that we
will be successful in expanding revenue from existing or new products at the
desired rate or in expanding our services business and the failure to do so
would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations

     businesses that synopsys has acquired or that synopsys may acquire in the
future including ikos and avant may not perform as projected  we have
acquired or merged with a number of companies in recent years and as part of
our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product and services offerings we
may acquire additional companies for example in july 2001 synopsys announced
the ikos merger and in december 2001 synopsys announced the avant merger in
addition to direct costs acquisitions pose a number of risks including
potential dilution of earnings per share problems in integrating the acquired
products and employees into our business the failure to realize expected
synergies or cost savings the failure of acquired products to achieve projected
sales the drain on management time for acquisitionrelated activities adverse
effects on customer buying patterns and assumption of unknown liabilities while
we attempt to review proposed acquisitions carefully and negotiate terms that
are favorable to us there is no assurance that any acquisition will have a
positive effect on our performance

     stagnation of international economies would adversely affect our
performance  during fiscal 2001 37 of our revenue was derived from outside
north america as compared to 42 during fiscal 2000 international sales are
vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic or political conditions and to
changes in foreign currency exchange rates economic conditions in europe japan
and the rest of asia have deteriorated in recent quarters and the longer this
weakness persists the more likely it is to have a negative impact on our
business in particular a number of our largest european customers are in the
telecommunications equipment business which has weakened considerably this
year the japanese economy has been stagnant for several years and may now be
entering a recession if the japanese economy remains weak revenue and orders
from japan and perhaps the rest of asia could be adversely affected in
addition the yendollar and eurodollar exchange rates remain subject to
unpredictable fluctuations weakness of the yen could adversely affect revenue
and orders from japan during future quarters asian countries other than japan
also have experienced economic and currency problems in recent years and in
most cases they have not fully recovered if such conditions persist or worsen
orders and revenues from the asia pacific region would be adversely affected

     synopsys success depends on recruiting and retaining key employees  our
success is dependent on technical and other contributions of key employees we
participate in a dynamic industry and our headquarters is in silicon valley
where despite recent economic conditions skilled technical sales and
management employees are in high demand there are a limited number of qualified
eda and ic design engineers and the competition for such individuals is
intense despite economic conditions startup activity in eda remains
significant and a number of eda companies have gone public in the past year
experience at synopsys is highly valued in the eda industry and the general
electronics industry and our employees are recruited aggressively by our
competitors and by startup companies in many industries in the past we have
experienced and may continue to experience significant employee turnover
there can be no assurance that we can continue to recruit and retain the
technical and managerial personnel we need to run our business

failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial
condition and results of operations

     synopsys is dependent on its proprietary technology  our success is
dependent in part upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual
property rights we rely on agreements with customers employees and others and
intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary technology there can be
no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we would have
adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise
become known or be independently developed by competitors moreover effective
intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain
foreign countries failure to obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright
or trade secret protection for any reason could have a material adverse effect
on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition
there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against
us and any such claims could require us to enter into royalty arrangements or
result in costly and timeconsuming litigation or could subject us to damages or
injunctions restricting our sale of products or could require us to redesign
products

     our operating expenses do not fluctuate proportionately with fluctuations
in revenues  our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of
future revenue and expense levels are generally committed in advance of
revenue since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue a
shortfall in revenue translates directly into a reduction in net income for the
first quarter of fiscal 2002 our target for total expenses is 162 to 166
million if we are unsuccessful in generating anticipated revenue or maintaining
expenses within this range however our business financial condition and
results of operations could be materially adversely affected

     synopsys has adopted antitakeover provisions which may have the effect of
delaying or preventing changes of control or management  we have adopted a
number of provisions that could have antitakeover effects our board of
directors has adopted a preferred shares rights plan commonly referred to as a
poison pill in addition our board of directors has the authority without
further action by its stockholders to issue additional shares of common stock
and to fix the rights and preferences of and to issue authorized but
undesignated shares of preferred stock these and other provisions of synopsys
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general
corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying
or preventing changes in control or management of synopsys including
transactions in which the stockholders of synopsys might otherwise receive a
premium for their shares over then current market prices

     synopsys is subject to changes in financial accounting standards which may
affect our reported revenue or the way we conduct business  we prepare our
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the united states of america gaap gaap are subject to interpretation by
the financial accounting standards board the american institute of certified
public accountants aicpa the sec and various bodies appointed by these
organizations to interpret existing rules and create new accounting policies in
particular a task force of the accounting standards executive committee a
subgroup of the aicpa meets on a quarterly basis to review various issues
arising under the existing software revenue recognition rules and
interpretations of these rules additional interpretations issued by the task
force may have an adverse effect on how we report revenue or on the way we
conduct our business in the future

     synopsys is subject to a number of special risks as a result of its planned
acquisition of avant  as a result of entering into an agreement to acquire
avant synopsys is subject to additional risks and uncertainties including the
following

      synopsys may fail to integrate successfully synopsys and avants
       operations as a result synopsys and avant may not achieve the
       anticipated benefits of the avant merger  synopsys and avant expect
       that the avant merger will result in benefits to synopsys and avant
       including the offering of a complete and over time integrated set of
       software products for the design and verification of complex integrated
       circuits to its customers however the expected benefits may not be
       fully realized achieving the benefits of the avant merger will depend
       on many factors including the successful and timely integration of the
       products technology and sales operations of the two companies following
       the completion of the avant merger these integration efforts may be
       difficult and time
                                        33

       consuming especially considering the highly technical and complex nature
       of each companys products failure to achieve a successful and timely
       integration of their respective products and sales operations could
       result in the loss of existing or potential customers of synopsys and
       avant and could have a material adverse effect on the business
       financial condition and results of operations of synopsys and its
       subsidiaries including avant and on the price of synopsys common
       shares integration efforts between the two companies will also divert
       significant management attention and resources this diversion of
       attention and resources could have an adverse effect on synopsys during
       such transition period

      avant has been required to pay substantial amounts in the recent
       resolution of criminal and civil litigation and might be required to pay
       substantial additional amounts under pending lawsuits  during 2001
       avant paid approximately 237 million in fines and restitution arising
       out of charges brought by the district attorney of santa clara county
       the santa clara criminal action avant does not expect any further
       proceedings in the santa clara criminal action and therefore does not
       expect to incur any additional litigation costs fines or other payments
       in such criminal action avant and its subsidiaries are engaged in a
       number of material civil litigation matters including an action brought
       by cadence design systems inc in december 1995 avantcadence
       litigation the avantcadence litigation generally arises out of the
       same set of facts that were the subject of the santa clara criminal
       action avant believes it has defenses to all of cadences claims and
       intends to defend itself vigorously should cadence ultimately succeed in
       the prosecution of its claims however avant could be required to pay
       substantial monetary damages to cadence some or all of these damages may
       be offset by the amounts paid to cadence as restitution in the santa
       clara criminal action

      injunctions entered in 1997 and 1998 enjoined avant from marketing its
      early place and route products arccell and aquarius based on a judicial
      determination that they incorporated portions of cadences design
      framework ii source code dfii the injunctions also prohibit avant from
      possessing using selling or licensing any product or work copied or
      derived from dfii and directly or indirectly marketing selling leasing
      licensing copying or transferring any of the arccell or aquarius
      products the dfii code is not incorporated in any current avant product
      although cadence has not made a claim in the avantcadence litigation
      against any current avant product including its apollo and astro place
      and route products and has not introduced any evidence that any such
      product infringes cadences intellectual property rights avant expects
      cadence to assert such claims avant believes it would have defenses to
      any such claims and avant would defend itself vigorously

      nonetheless should cadence be successful at proving that any past or
      thencurrent avant product incorporated intellectual property
      misappropriated from cadence avant could be permanently enjoined from
      further use of such intellectual property which might require
      modification to existing products andor suspension of the sale of such
      products until such cadence intellectual property was removed the
      avantcadence litigation other pending avant litigation and other
      potential litigation regardless of the outcome may continue to result in
      substantial costs and expenses and significant diversion of effort by
      management and may negatively impact relationships with customers an
      adverse result in any of these litigation matters could seriously harm
      avants and after the proposed avant merger synopsys business
      financial condition and results of operations

      the insurer under the litigation protection insurance relating to the
       avantcadence litigation may be prevented from paying for certain losses
       on the grounds that such payment violates public policy synopsys has
       agreed to enter into a policy with an insurance company rated aaa by
       standard  poors under the policy insurance will be provided to pay
       synopsys an amount equaling certain compensatory exemplary and punitive
       damages penalties and fines and attorneys fees arising out of the
       avantcadence litigation covered loss the policy does not provide
       coverage for litigation other than the avantcadence litigation in
       exchange for a binding fee of 10 million paid by synopsys the insurer
       has issued a legally binding commitment to provide the coverage
       effective following the closing of the avant merger such fee is
       refundable in part to synopsys in the event the avant merger is not
       completed otherwise the fee will be credited against the premium to
       make the insurance effective
                                        34
page

       which must be paid by synopsys to the insurer on or about the closing of
       the avant merger in return for a premium of 335 million including the
       binding fee the insurer will be obligated to pay covered loss up to a
       limit of liability equaling a 500 million plus b interest accruing
       at the fixed rate of 2 compounded semiannually on 250 million the
       policy will expire upon a final judgment or settlement of the
       avantcadence litigation or any earlier date upon synopsys election
       upon such expiration synopsys will be entitled to a payment equal to
       250 million plus interest calculated as set forth above less any loss
       paid under the policy

      certain of the potential losses relating to the avantcadence litigation
      that are covered by the terms of the litigation protection insurance
      obtained by synopsys with respect to that litigation may arise from
      exemplary and punitive damages fines and penalties in some
      jurisdictions it may be against public policy to provide insurance for
      willful acts punitive damages or similar claims this could potentially
      affect the validity of certain elements of the policy the legal agreement
      governing the arrangement will be governed by the laws of the state of
      delaware synopsys believes that the arrangement will be enforceable in
      delaware but there can be no assurance in this regard to the extent the
      insurer is prevented from paying certain losses on grounds of public
      policy that would otherwise be covered by the insurance coverage will be
      unavailable for that portion of the losses and the insurer may be
      obligated to refund a portion of the premium to synopsys

      whether or not the avant merger is completed the announcement of the
       proposed avant merger may cause disruptions in the business of synopsys
       which could have material adverse effects on the business and operations
       of synopsys  whether or not the proposed avant merger is completed
       synopsys customers in response to the announcement of the proposed
       avant merger may delay or defer decisions which could have a material
       adverse effect on the business of synopsys similarly current and
       prospective synopsys employees may experience uncertainty about their
       future roles with synopsys this may adversely affect synopsys ability
       to attract and retain key management sales marketing and technical
       personnel the extent of this adverse effect could depend on the length
       of time prior to completion of the proposed avant merger or termination
       of the merger agreement between synopsys and avant

      failure to complete the avant merger could negatively impact synopsys
       stock price future business and operations  if the avant merger is not
       completed for any reason synopsys may be subject to a number of material
       risks including the following synopsys may face difficulties in
       attracting strategic customers and partners who were expecting to use the
       integrated product suite proposed to be offered by the merged company to
       assist in the development of new products by the separate companies and
       certain costs relating to the proposed avant merger such as legal
       accounting financial advisor and printing fees must be paid even if the
       proposed avant merger is not completed

      following the merger synopsys will not have control over the
       avantcadence litigation or the authority to settle the avantcadence
       litigation except in limited circumstances  under the terms of the
       litigation protection insurance obtained by synopsys with respect to the
       avantcadence litigation described above which will become effective
       immediately following the merger the insurer has the right to exercise
       full control over the defense of the avantcadence litigation including
       both the strategy and tactics to be employed further the insurer has
       the right to exclusively control the negotiation discussion and terms of
       any proposed settlement except that synopsys retains the right to settle
       the avantcadence litigation with the consent of the insurer for up to
       250 million plus accruing interest less certain costs therefore
       following the merger synopsys will have a severely limited ability to
       control any risks associated with and the timing related to any
       liabilities resulting from the avantcadence litigation

introduction

        synopsys inc synopsys or the company is a leading supplier of
electronic design automation eda software to the global electronics industry
the companys products are used by designers of integrated circuits ics
including systemonachip ics and the electronic products such as computers
cell phones and internet routers that use such ics to automate significant
portions of their chip design process ics are distinguished by the speed at
which they run their area the amount of power they consume and the cost of
production the companys products offer its customers the opportunity to design
ics that are optimized for speed area power consumption and production cost
while reducing overall design time the company also provides consulting
services to assist customers with their ic designs as well as training and
support services synopsys was incorporated in delaware in 1987

the role of eda in the electronics industry

        over the past three decades technology advances in the semiconductor
industry have dramatically increased the size speed and capacity of ics

         the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip has doubled
          roughly every 18 months a stateoftheart ic may hold over 20
          million transistors this is made possible in large part because the
          width of the features on the chip is steadily shrinking most ics
          today are produced at 035 micron or 025 micron over the next
          several years the bulk of production will shift to 018 micron and
          then to 013 micron or below

         the speed at which chips operate has steadily increased
          microprocessors operating at 14 gigahertz a speed that was unheard
          of a few years ago are available today

         chips are also becoming more economical in their power consumption
          which is necessary to drive more and more powerful handheld devices

         increasingly functions that formerly were performed by multiple ics
          attached to a printed circuit board are being combined in a single
          chip referred to as a systemonachip

        combined these changes have fostered the development of computers
internet routers wireless communications networks handheld personal digital
assistants and many other goods and services with tremendous capabilities at
relatively low cost

        in the current economic environment competition and continuing
innovation have shortened the life cycle of electronic products so
timetomarket is crucial to the success of a product time to market can in
large part be determined by the time it takes to design the chip that will run
such product eda products play a critical role in reducing timetomarket for
new products by providing ic designers with tools and techniques to a reduce
the time and manual effort required to design analyze and verify individual
ics b improve the performance and density of complex ic designs and c
enhance the reliability of the ic design and manufacturing process

the design process

        in simplified form the design of an integrated circuit consists of five
basic steps



                                                                               3
page   4

        system design first a designer describes the functions that the chip
is to perform in a specialized high level computer language during this phase
designers perform high level architectural design tradeoffs to determine for
example which algorithms to use to implement the design and what portions of
the design to implement in hardware and what portions in software at the
completion of this phase the designer produces a register transfer language
or rtl description of the chip most of this process is completed manually
although there is a small but growing market for products that help automate
design and verification at the system level

        logic synthesis after the designer is satisfied with the rtl code a
logic synthesis program converts the rtl code into a logical diagram of the
chip related programs insert the circuitry that will be required to test the
chip after manufacture a gate level so called because it describes the
various logic blocks or gates required to implement the chip data file is
produced in a growing number of designs the logic synthesis phase is performed
together with a portion of physical design this combined process known as
physical synthesis produces a file containing placed gates which describes
the logic blocks and includes information about where they will be physically
located or placed on a chip see discussion below under current issues
facing ic designers

        high level verification at this stage the designer uses simulation and
related programs to verify that the design successfully performs the functions
that the designer intended by feeding an exhaustive array of potential inputs
into a specialized program simulating the functioning of the chip as
designed and checking to confirm that the outputs match what was expected the
designer also uses a timing analysis program to confirm that the chip as
designed will operate at the speed the designer intended

        physical design if the designer is satisfied with the results of high
level verification the transistors and all of the wires connecting each one of
them are mapped out in a series of transformations that gradually gets more and
more detailed first the location on the chip die of each block of the chip and
each transistor within each block is determined  a process known as
placement  then all of the connections between the transistors are
determined  a process known as routing the result is one or more data files
that can be read by physical verification programs see below or by the
equipment used to manufacture the chip

        physical verification before sending the design data file to a chip
manufacturer for fabrication a further verification step is undertaken the
designer must confirm that the chip as placed and routed will operate at the
speed anticipated during the logic design phase the designer also must check
for unintended electrical effects that may arise as a consequence of placing
certain portions of the chip or routing certain of its wires too close
together or in a bad position finally the designer must verify that the final
design complies with all of the design rules set forth by the party that will
manufacture the chip

        the foregoing discussion has been greatly simplified in the actual
design of a chip each of these steps has a number of different elements the
steps or the different elements within the steps may be undertaken in a
different order or repeated one to multiple times in any event if at any stage
of the process the chip does not perform as intended then the designer must go
back one or more steps to either redesign the rtl redesign the logic rerun
the verification or redo the physical design of the chip each iteration takes
time and the more time the process takes the more difficult it will be for the
designer to meet his or her time to market goals

current issues facing ic designers

        as chip technology continues to advance and particularly as the
stateoftheart in chip design moves to 018 micron and below synopsys
customers are facing a number of difficult design challenges

        timing closure ensuring that a chip will run at the desired speed
becomes substantially more difficult as transistor sizes move to 018 micron and
below at larger transistor feature sizes ic designers could use standard
estimates of chip timing during the logic design phase and be confident that
the timing characteristics would be preserved through the physical design phase
at 018 micron and below these estimates become more and more unreliable to
address this problem customers will increasingly need products referred to in
the eda industry as physical synthesis products that integrate logic design
and physical design synopsys physical synthesis solution takes physical design
information into account during logic design and produces a file containing
placed gates physical synthesis provides more accurate timing estimates at
the logic design phase and greatly improving the correlation between original
timing estimates after logic design and timing results after physical design

        verification verification is the process of ensuring at various stages
of the design process that a chip will perform as intended as the number of
transistors on a chip grows the verification problem grows geometrically in



                                                                               4

fact with todays chips verification often takes up the single largest
proportion of the overall design process verification products must offer
customers a combination of speed accuracy and the ability to focus on the
portions of the chip most likely to cause problems

        designer shortage finding hiring and retaining qualified design
engineers is often the most difficult problem that our customers face without
enough designers it is difficult for a company to meet ambitious development
schedules and to get its products to market in a timely manner companies
address this shortage in a variety of ways including seeking to import
designers from outside of the united states locating development efforts
offshore and outsourcing all or parts of their design work for eda companies
the shortage of designers creates opportunities for companies that offer
predesigned preverified design building blocks that can be reused in
multiple designs and that offer professional services to augment their
customers design teams

verification and test products

        the companys verification and test products consist of a group of
tools including simulation test automation and timing verification products
to enable ic designers to quickly and reliably verify the behavior of a design
before it is committed to the expensive and timeconsuming process of ic
fabrication and to assist in the testing of the chip after manufacturing

        during fiscal 2000 verification and test products accounted for 30 of
the companys revenues

        simulation and related products simulation software exercises an ic
design by running it through a series of tests and comparing the actual outputs
from the design with the expected output as such simulation products are the
key products for functional verification the goal of simulation is to make sure
that the functionality and timing performance of the design meets the original
specifications of the chip synopsys offers two products for highlevel
simulation vcstm for designs written in verilog one of the two principal
register transfer languages and sciroccotm for designs written in vhdl the
other principal rtl simulation products are distinguished principally by their
runtime  ie how fast they can fully simulate a proposed design the company
is focused on providing the industrys fastest simulation technology and
believes that both vcs and scirocco are industry leaders in performance and
capacity vcs is supported by all major semiconductor manufacturers and many
thirdparty eda software providers

        in addition to focusing on building the fastest simulator synopsys is
focused on developing a suite of products that help simulation products work
smarter the company estimates that more time is spent in writing verification
testbenches than in creating the design description testbenches which create
stimuli for chips and check the results are used in conjunction with simulation
tools to verify that a design functions as expected the verification technology
group provides software that helps generate and manage testbenches as well as
evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation process verar is a tool that
automates the design of testbenches thereby offering the ic designer
significant reductions in overall design and verification time vera provides a

        static timing analysis synopsys provides a complete tool suite to help
designers perform static timing analysis at the gate and transistor levels and
analyze signal integrity issues such as crosstalk synopsys gatelevel
analysis tool is called primetimer primetime is a fullchip gatelevel
static timing analysis tool targeted for complex multimillion gate designs
which is used by designers to verify at various stages of the design process
the speed at which a design will operate when it is fabricated primetimes
analysis of a designs speed is accepted as a sign off tool by virtually all
major semiconductor manufacturers which means that they accept its analysis as
determinative synopsys transistorlevel timing analysis products are described
below under transistor level design

        formal verification  equivalence checking formal verification is a
method for comparing two versions of a design to determine if they are
equivalent usually an rtl version of the design is validated using simulation
and other dynamic verification tools establishing it as the golden version
subsequent versions ie after each step of the design process are then
compared to the golden version using mathematical algorithms to determine if




                                                                               7
page   8
they are functionally equivalent the use of formal verification greatly reduces
the need to perform simulation which is substantially more timeconsuming at
each stage of the design process thus potentially saving a significant amount
of time in the overall design process synopsys formal verification product is
formalityr formality was one of the industrys first commercial equivalency
checkers to employ a multisolver architecture which enables the verification
of complex multimilliongate systemonachip designs in days or minutes

        the companys ip and systems products include our designware models
and systems design and verification products

        during fiscal 2000 ip and systems products accounted for 14 of the
companys revenues

        intellectual property products as ic designs continue to grow in size
reusing design blocks is becoming a more important method for reducing overall
design cycle time by reusing portions of a design and particularly those that
implement basic or standardized functions a company can let its ic design team
focus on designing the chip features that will give its product a competitive
advantage it can also reduce its verification risk by ensuring that these
portions of the chip are of high quality enabling reuse of intellectual
property ip requires a significant methodology shift from traditional ic
design in the past designs were intimately tied to a particular semiconductor
process technology or design methodology making reuse of design blocks from one
chip design to the next difficult and costly

        synopsys designwarer product provides ic designers with libraries of
predesigned preverified synopsyssynthesizable ie usable by synopsys

        the companys future performance depends in large part on its ability to
maintain and enhance its current product lines develop new products maintain
technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer
requirements in addition to research and development conducted within each
business unit the company maintains an advanced research group that is
responsible for exploring new directions and applications of its core
technologies migrating new technologies into the existing product lines and
maintaining strong research relationships outside the company within both
industry and academia

        during fiscal years 2000 1999 and 1998 research and development
expenses net of capitalized software development costs were 1893 million
1671 million and 1567 million respectively for the onemonth period ended
october 31 1999 research and development expenses were 172 million synopsys
capitalized software development costs of approximately 10 million 10
million and 21 million in fiscal 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively for the
onemonth period ended october 31 1999 capitalized software development costs
were not material the company anticipates that it will continue to commit
substantial resources to research and development in the future

manufacturing

        synopsys manufacturing operations consist of assembling testing
packaging and shipping its system and software products and documentation needed
to fulfill each order manufacturing is currently performed in synopsys
mountain view california beaverton oregon and dublin ireland facilities
outside vendors provide tape and cdrom duplication printing of documentation
and manufacturing of packaging materials synopsys employees manufacture and
test the hardware modeling system products with some subassembly performed by
outside vendors synopsys typically ships its software products within 10 days
of acceptance of customer purchase orders and execution of software license
agreements unless the customer has requested otherwise on customer request
synopsys delivers its software products through electronic means rather than
shipping disks this method of delivery is becoming increasingly common for
domestic customers for its hardware modeling products synopsys buys components
and assemblies in anticipation of orders and configures units to match orders
typically shipping within one to ten weeks of order acceptance unless the
customer has requested otherwise

competition

        the eda industry is highly competitive we compete against other eda
vendors and with customers internally developed design tools and internal
design capabilities for a share of the overall eda budgets of our potential
customers in general competition is based on product quality and features
postsale support price and as discussed below the ability to offer a
complete design flow our competitors include companies that offer a broad range
of products and services such as cadence mentor graphics and avant as well
as companies including numerous startup companies that offer products focused
on a discrete phase of the integrated circuit design process in certain
situations synopsys competitors have been offering aggressive discounts on
certain of their products in particular simulation and synthesis products as a
result average prices for these products may fall in order to compete
successfully we must continue to enhance our products and bring to market new
products that address the needs of our customers we also will have to expand
our consulting services business the failure to enhance existing products
develop andor acquire new products or expand our ability to offer consulting
services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial
condition and results of operations

        technology advances and customer requirements continue to fuel a change
in the nature of competition among eda vendors increasingly eda companies
compete on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical
design products referred to as physical synthesis products rather than on
the basis of individual point tools performing a discrete phase of the design
process the need to offer physical synthesis products will become increasingly
important as ics grow more complex our main physical synthesis product was
fully released in june 2000 and has been wellreceived by customers but we


                                                                              12
page   13
still do not offer customers a complete design flow we are working on
completing our design flow although there is no guarantee that we will be able
to offer a competitive flow to customers the market for physical design tools
is dominated by cadence and avant both of which offer products linking logic
and physical design if we are unsuccessful in developing a complete design flow
on a timely basis or in convincing customers to adopt our integrated logical and
physical design products and methodology our competitive position could be
significantly weakened

product sales and licensing agreements

        synopsys typically licenses its software to customers under
nonexclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and that
restrict use of the software to specified purposes within specified geographical
areas the company currently licenses the majority of its software as a network
license that allows a number of individual users to access the software on a
defined network license fees are dependent on the type of license product mix
and number of copies of each product required

        synopsys currently offers its software products under either a perpetual
license or a shorterterm subscription license under a perpetual license a
customer pays a one time license fee for the right to use the software the vast
majority of customers also purchase annual software support services under
which they receive minor enhancements to the products developed during the year
bug fixes and technical assistance a subscription license and the various
forms of timebased licenses that the company has offered before introducing
subscription licenses operates like a rental of software a customer pays a fee
for license and support over a fixed period of time and at the end of the time
period the license expires unless the customer pays for a renewal subscription
licenses are offered with a range of terms the average length is approximately
three years see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations results of operationsrevenue

        over the past several years orders for timebased licenses now
subscription licenses have increased significantly as a percentage of total
product orders during fiscal year 2000 orders for timebased licenses
accounted for 74 of total product orders compared to 64 in fiscal 1999 and
111 in fiscal 1998

        during fiscal year 2001 synopsys expects that orders for subscription
licenses will account for approximately 75 of total product orders and orders
for perpetual licenses approximately 25 of total product orders although there
are likely to be variations of plus or minus five percentage points in any
particular quarter

        synopsys offers its hardware modeler products for sale or lease

proprietary rights

        the company primarily relies upon a combination of copyright patent
trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to
establish and protect proprietary rights in its products the source code for
synopsys products is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished
copyrighted work however it may be possible for third parties to develop
similar technology independently in addition effective copyright and trade
secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries
the company currently holds us and foreign patents on some of the technologies
included in its products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the
future

        although the company believes that its products trademarks and other
proprietary rights do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties
there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against
the company in the future or that any such claims will not require the company
to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly and timeconsuming
litigation

employees

        as of october 31 2000 synopsys had a total of 2922 employees of whom
2098 were based in the united states and 824 were based internationally
synopsys future financial results depend in part upon the continued service
of its key technical and senior management personnel and its continuing ability
to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel
competition for such personnel is intense experience at synopsys is highly
valued in the eda industry and the companys employees are recruited
aggressively by competitors and by startup companies including those in
internetrelated businesses the companys salaries are competitive in the
market but under certain circumstances startup companies can offer more
attractive stock option packages as a result the company has experienced and
may continue to experience significant employee turnover there can be no
assurance that synopsys can retain its key managerial and technical employees or




                                                                              13

managerial personnel in the future none of synopsys employees is represented
by a labor union synopsys has not experienced any work stoppages and considers
its relations with its employees to be good

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

        the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements within the
meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 for example
statements including terms such as projects expects believes
anticipates or targets are forwardlooking statements actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in such forwardlooking statements as a
result of certain factors including those set forth under factors that may
affect future results

results of operations

        business combinations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the
company acquired virsim a software product from innoveda inc for a purchase
price of approximately 70 million in cash the purchase price of the
transaction was allocated to the acquired assets based on their estimated fair
values as of the date of the acquisition amounts allocated to intangible assets
and goodwill are being amortized on a straightline basis over a threeyear
period

        during the third quarter of fiscal 2000 the company acquired the
silicon group inc tsg a privately held provider of integrated circuit ic
design and intellectual property ip integration services for a purchase price
of 30 million including cash payments of 18 million the purchase price was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair
values at the time of the acquisition amounts allocated to intangible assets
and goodwill are being amortized on a straightline basis over a fouryear
period

        during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 the company acquired leda sa
leda a privately held provider of rtl codingstylecheckers for a purchase
price of 77 million including cash payments of 75 million the purchase
price of the transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities
based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition amounts
allocated to developed technology workforce and goodwill are being amortized on
a straightline basis over a fiveyear period approximately 18 million was
allocated to inprocess research and development and charged to operations
because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and
had no alternative uses

        disposition of viewlogic pcbsystems business  effect on comparative
financial information the company merged with viewlogic in december 1997 in a
transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests on october 2 1998 the
company sold the printed circuit board and electronics systems business
pcbsystems business of viewlogic in the discussion below financial
information for fiscal 1999 excludes the pcbsystems business while financial
information for fiscal 1998 includes the results of the pcbsystems business
therefore the comparative measures included in the discussion in particular
with respect to absolute dollar amounts of revenue or expenditure are not
necessarily valid with respect to the companys business as it is presently
conducted a pro forma unaudited consolidated statement of income for 1998
excluding the results of the pcbsystems business and certain unusual charges
was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on
january 25 1999

        revenue revenue consists of fees for licenses and subscriptions of the
companys software products the companys total revenue decreased by 3 in
fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 the decrease in revenue in fiscal 2000 was
primarily attributable to changes we made to our license model at the beginning
of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 total revenue for the one month transition
period ended october 311999 was 232 million with product and service revenue
of 42 million and 190 million respectively this is compared to the one
month ended october 31 1998 with total revenue of 282 million with product
and service revenue of 99 million and 183 million respectively

        on july 31 2000 synopsys introduced technology subscription licenses
tsls tsls are timelimited rights to use synopsys software the terms of
tsls and the payments due thereon may be structured flexibly to meet the needs
of the customer for creditworthy customers payments will often extend over the
entire term of the license with minor exceptions under tsls customers cannot
obtain major new products developed or acquired during the term of their license
without making an additional purchase tsls will be structured so that both
product and service revenue will generally be recognized ratably over the term
of the license or as payments become due we expect that the average duration
of tsls will be approximately three years

        synopsys expects that approximately 75 of its new product orders will
be for tsls and approximately 25 will be for perpetual licenses in each case
plus or minus 5 synopsys believes that the principal benefits of tsls will be
that synopsys will i be able to offer customers technology and terms that more




                                                                              17
page   18
closely match their needs ii have greater visibility into our earnings
stream iii see improvements in the pricing environment for our products and
iv be able to roll out our new technology in a more planned manner

        the replacement of timebased licenses by subscription licenses will
impact our reported revenue and reported revenue declined in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2000 as compared to both the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 and the
third quarter of fiscal 2000 under a subscription license relatively little
revenue is recognized during the quarter the product is delivered and the rest
goes into deferred revenue to be recognized over the term of the license under
the old form of timebased license generally all license revenue has been
recognized in the quarter the product is delivered with relatively little going
into deferred revenue therefore an order for subscription licenses will result
in much less currentquarter revenue than an equalsized order for the old form
of timebased license

        product revenue decreased by 13 to 4425 million in fiscal 2000 from
5058 million in fiscal 1999 and increased by 17 from 4310 million in fiscal
1998 compared to fiscal 1999 the decrease in fiscal 2000 is primarily due to
the change in the license model to tsls which are recognized ratably over the
term of the license the increase in fiscal 1999 is primarily due to increased
worldwide licensing and sales of the companys eda software products such as
synthesis verification and system level design software products service
revenue increased by 14 to 3413 million in fiscal 2000 from 3003 million in
fiscal 1999 and by 5 from 2870 million in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal
1999 for each of the years these increases were primarily attributable to the
renewal of maintenance and support contracts for eda products and growth in
customer training and consulting services

        revenue from international operations was 3270 million 2752 million
and 2798 million or 42 34 and 39 of total revenue in fiscal 2000 1999
and 1998 respectively the increase in international revenue as a percentage of
total revenue in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily a result of
relatively greater revenue growth in japan and asia pacific this revenue
increase for this region is due to the continued economic recovery in the
pacific rim and the companys increased sales focus in this region during fiscal
2000 revenue from our international operations decreased 31 to 87 million
for the one month transition period ended october 31 1999 compared to 125
million for the one month ended october 31 1998 this decrease is attributed to
reduced customer shipment requests to receive licenses in october 1999
international revenue represented approximately 37 and 44 of total revenue for
the onemonth ended october 31 1999 and 1998 respectively

compiler a product that unifies synthesis placement and global routing
included in the physical synthesis family are chip architect the companys chip
floorplanning product flex route the companys highlevel router and the
companys detailed routing technology this product family contributed revenue
of 326 million during fiscal 2000 the company expects continued increases in
the revenue contribution from the physical synthesis family in future years the
decline in revenue contribution percentage of the dc family from fiscal 1999 to
fiscal 2000 reflects the maturation of the market for design compiler and the
beginning of what we believe is a transition from the dc family to the newer

generation of products the company expects that revenue and orders from the dc
family will remain approximately flat from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and then
will begin to decline future revenue growth in the ic implementation product
group is anticipated to come from the physical synthesis product family

        verification and test verification and test includes the companys
simulation timing analysis formal verification and test products the increase
in percentage of total company revenue from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000 is due to
greater demand for verification products from our customers the company expects
demand for verification products to continue to increase as both systems and
semiconductor companies experience a crisis in verification

intellectual property and system level design products include designware
models system design products and cell libraries recently sold to artisan
components  see note 10 subsequent events of notes to synopsys consolidated

simulation and analysis the decline in revenue contribution from 12 in fiscal
1999 to 7 in fiscal 2000 was due to the lack of significant large orders during
fiscal 2000 and the effects of competition this decline also impacted overall
company performance in fiscal 2000 the company believes the technology embedded
in these tools will have significant value to our customers as these customers
migrate to smaller geometries in their chip designs

        professional services the companys professional services group
includes consulting and training activities as well as the companys new
internet design service business the professional services group provides a
comprehensive portfolio of consulting services covering all critical phases of
the systemonachip development process as well as systems development in
wireless and broadband applications the increase in the total company revenue
contribution for this services group from 8 in fiscal 1999 to 10 in fiscal
2000 is due largely to the increased demand for the companys turnkey design and
wireless and broadband consulting services the company anticipates continued
growth in fiscal 2001

        cost of revenue cost of product revenue includes personnel and related
costs production costs product packaging documentation amortization of
capitalized software development costs and purchased technology and costs of
the components of the companys hardware system products the cost of internally
developed capitalized software is amortized based on the greater of the ratio of
current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue
or the straightline method over the softwares estimated economic life of
approximately two years cost of product revenue was 10 of total product
revenue for fiscal 2000 as compared to 8 for fiscal 1999 the increase in cost
of product revenue is due primarily to the change in the license strategy
introduced in q4 of fiscal 2000 the companys product costs are relatively
fixed and do not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or changes in
revenue recognition methods cost of product revenue for fiscal 1998 was 8 of
total product revenue cost of service revenue includes personnel and the
related costs associated with providing training and consulting services cost
of service revenue as a percentage of total service revenue was 24 in fiscal
2000 23 in fiscal 1999 and 20 in 1998 the increases in cost of service
revenue over the last two fiscal periods results from the continued investment
in the companys infrastructure required to expand its consulting and training
businesses for the onemonth transition period ended october 31 1999 cost of
revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 32 compared to 31 for the one
month ended october 31 1998 the increase in cost of revenue resulted primarily
from increased royalties and personnel costs relating to maintenance and
support the company expects that cost of revenue in fiscal 2001 will remain
flat or increase slightly in addition fiscal 2001 will include an additional
week of operations due to the method by which we determine our fiscal year

        research and development research and development expenses increased by
13 to 1893 million in fiscal 2000 from 1671 million in fiscal 1999 and by
7 in fiscal 1999 compared to 1567 million in fiscal 1998 net of capitalized
software development costs research and development expenses represented 24
21 and 22 of total revenue in fiscal 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively the
increase in absolute dollars reflects the companys ongoing research and
development a significant portion of the increase for each fiscal year was due
to the addition of personnel and personnel related costs partly through
acquisitions for enhancement of existing applications and development of new
products also fiscal 1998 included an additional week of operations which was
partially offset by synergies realized from the integration of viewlogic into
synopsys operations research and development expenses for the onemonth
transition period ended october 31 1999 were 172 million as compared to 149



                                                                              19

million for the onemonth ended october 31 1998 this increase can be
attributed to increases in personnel and personnel related costs the company
anticipates that it will continue to commit substantial resources to research
and development in the future provided that it is able to continue to hire and
retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel if the company believes that
it is unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner it may license
technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative
to internal research and development fiscal 2001 will include an additional
week of operations due to the method by which we determine our fiscal year

        sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by 20 to
2888 million in fiscal 2000 from 2416 million in fiscal 1999 and decreased
by 2 from 2454 million in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1999 sales and
marketing expenses represented 37 30 and 34 of total revenue in fiscal 2000
1999 and 1998 respectively total expenses increased in absolute dollars and as
a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of increases in
personnel related costs total expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of revenue in fiscal 1999 primarily as a result of the divestiture of
the pcbsystems business as well as savings resulting from ongoing integration
of viewlogics other operations into the company as a whole the fiscal 1998
increase over fiscal 1999 primarily resulted from the additional week of
operations sales and marketing expenses for the onemonth transition period
ended october 31 1999 were 190 million as compared to 169 million for the
onemonth ended october 31 1998 this increase primarily related to the higher
costs associated with the 1999 annual business planning events fiscal 2001 will
include an additional week of operations due to the method by which we determine
our fiscal year

        general and administrative general and administrative expenses
increased to 592 million in fiscal 2000 compared to 471 million in fiscal
1999 general and administrative expense decreased slightly from 472 million
in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1999 as a percentage of total revenue
general and administrative expenses were 8 6 and 7 in fiscal 2000 1999 and
1998 respectively in fiscal 2000 the increase in absolute dollars and
percentage of revenue was primarily due to increases in bad debt expense
personnel costs facility expenditures and patent and proxy services general
and administrative expenses for the onemonth transition period ended october
31 1999 were 57 million as compared to 49 million for the onemonth ended
october 31 1998 this increase was primarily a result of higher professional
service fees fiscal 2001 will include an additional week of operations due to
the method by which we determine our fiscal year

        operating expense targets  fiscal 2001 for fiscal 2001 our target

represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by the company under the
companys accounting policies intangible assets as of october 31 2000
including goodwill are being amortized over the estimated useful life of three
to fiveyear periods the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by
determining whether the amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered
through estimated future undiscounted cash flows amortization of intangible
assets charged to operations in fiscal 2000 was 151 million as compared to
79 million for fiscal 1999 amortization of intangible assets charged to
operations for the onemonth ended october 31 1999 was 12 million
amortization of intangible assets for the onemonth ended october 31 1998 was

        purchased inprocess research and development iprd of 17 million and
212 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively represent the writeoff of
inprocess technologies associated with our acquisitions of leda in fiscal 2000
and gambit automated design inc gambit stanza systems inc stanza
smartech the rights to covermeter a software product owned by advanced
technology center and apteq design systems inc apteq in fiscal 1999 at
the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had
not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in
process had no alternative future uses accordingly these amounts were expensed
on the respective acquisition dates of each of the acquired companies also see
note 3 business combinations of notes to synopsys consolidated financial
statements

        valuation of iprd we calculated amounts allocated to iprd using
established valuation techniques in the high technology industry and expensed
such amounts in the quarter that each acquisition was consummated because
technological feasibility had not been achieved and no alternative future uses
had been established this approach gave consideration to relevant market sizes
and growth factors expected industry trends the anticipated nature and timing
of new product introductions by us and our competitors individual product sales
cycles and the estimated life of each products underlying technology

        the fair value of the inprocess technology was based on a discounted
cash flow model similar to the traditional income approach which discounts
expected future cash flows to present value net of tax in discounting the
estimated cash flows the discount rates used in the present value calculations
were typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis
adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life
cycle the risks associated with achieving such projected cash flows upon
successful completion of the acquired projects and the risks and uncertainties
in incorporating the acquired technology into the companys development
projects

        other income net other income net was 408 million 370 million
and 260 million or 5 5 and 4 of total revenue in fiscal 2000 1999 and
1998 respectively other income net increased in absolute dollars each fiscal
year primarily due to higher interest income from higher invested cash balances
in fiscal 1999 and from a higher mix of taxable to taxexempt investments in
fiscal 2000 in addition in fiscal 2000 1999 and 1998 other income net
increased due to gains realized on sales of equity investments other income
net for the onemonth transition period ended october 31 1999 was 17 million
as compared to 11 million for the onemonth ended october 31 1998

        interest rate risk the companys exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relate primarily to its investment portfolio the company does
not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

quality standards as specified in the companys investment policy the policy
also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer and type of

longterm debt and equity price risk related to the companys longterm
investments

        foreign currency risk at the present time the company does not
generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows but hedges only those
currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in
nonfunctional currencies hedging activities undertaken by the company are
intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on these balances the
success of this activity depends upon estimates of intercompany balances
denominated in various currencies primarily the japanese yen and the euro the
company had contracts for the sale and purchase of foreign currencies with a
notional value expressed in us dollars of 475 million looking forward the
company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use
of these instruments there can be no assurance in the future that these hedging
transactions will be effective

        extraordinary items during fiscal 2000 and 1999 the company incurred
no extraordinary gains or losses during the first quarter of fiscal 1998 the
company recorded an extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt of 19
million net of income tax expense of 10 million related to the cancellation
of certain interest bearing notes issued by the company to international
business machines corporation ibm

        during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 synopsys completed the partial
spinoff of viewlogic systems inc vsi a company that owns the printed
circuit board pcbsystems business of viewlogic synopsys merger with
viewlogic in december 1997 was accounted for as a pooling of interests the
spinoff was accounted for as an extraordinary item as provided by paragraph 60
of accounting principles board opinion no 16 apb 16 and synopsys recorded an
extraordinary gain net of income tax expense of 265 million in fiscal 1998
in respect to the spinoff synopsys retained common stock equal to 149 of the
fully diluted equity in vsi

        the company concluded that the disposition of vsi was consistent with
its treatment of the synopsysviewlogic merger as a pooling of interests a
condition of the poolingofinterests treatment is that at the time of the
merger management did not plan to dispose of any significant part of the assets
of the merged entity the company concluded that this condition was met because
on the date of the synopsysviewlogic merger the company did not plan to
dispose of the pcbsystems business the company believed that there would be
synergies between the companys highlevel integrated circuit design products
and vsis pcb design products the ultimate decision to spinoff vsi was based
on changes in circumstances following the synopsysviewlogic merger

        during the months following the merger the company came to realize that
certain of its assumptions and expectations regarding the operation of the
pcbsystems business as part of synopsys were not being fulfilled the companys
initial intent to retain vsi altered due to changes in circumstances as follows

               a number of engineers working in the pcbsystems business were
                hired by competitors and management became concerned that it
                would lose more if the business remained part of synopsys



                                                                              22
page   23

               certain synergies anticipated from operation of the pcbsystems
                business as part of synopsys did not materialize

               the revenues of the pcbsystems business grew more slowly than
                those of synopsys other businesses management concluded that
                the reduction in the companys overall growth rate caused by the
                pcbsystems business was contributing to a market discounting of
                the companys stock value

               managers of the pcbsystems business concluded that the business
                could grow faster if it was a standalone entity which would
                allow them to attract and retain key employees


        accordingly synopsys has not changed its accounting for the viewlogic
merger and has reported the gain on the vsi disposition as an extraordinary
item

for based on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and
qualifies for hedge accounting the company will adopt sfas no 133 for the
fiscal year beginning november 1 2000 the company does not expect to have a
transition adjustment related to the adoption of sfas 133

        during fiscal 2000 the securities and exchange commission issued staff
accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements the objective of sab 101 is to provide further guidance on revenue
recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a
specific arrangement or a specific industry the company is required to adopt

liquidity and capital resources

        cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 4356 million at
october 31 2000 a decrease of 2738 million or 39 from october 31 1999 the
decrease is primarily a result of cash outflow for financing and investing
activities mainly the repurchase of common stock of 3975 million capital
expenditures of 685 million cash paid for acquisitions of 145 million and
cash paid on debt obligations of 143 million these outflows were partially
offset by cash generated by operations of 1511 million and through investing
and financing activities mainly the exercise of stock options and sale of stock
through the employee stock purchase plan of 595 million and proceeds from
sale of longterm investments of 243 million

        accounts receivable increased 12 during fiscal 2000 while sales
declined by 3 to 7838 million in fiscal 2000 from 8061 million in fiscal
1999 days sales outstanding in receivables increased to 99 days as of october
31 2000 from 61 days at september 30 1999 largely as a result of decreased
revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 as compared to the same period in
fiscal 1999 the decrease in revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000
was the result of a change in the companys license and pricing strategy as of
october 31 2000 the remaining balance of the companys accounts receivable
sold to a financial institution was 53 million

        the companys management believes that its current cash cash
equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will
satisfy its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at
least the next twelve months

and earnings which makes it difficult to achieve predictable revenue and
earnings growth among these factors are customer product and service demand
product license terms and the timing of revenue recognition on products and
services sold the following specific factors could affect our revenues and
earnings in a particular quarter or over several quarterly or annual periods

       our orders have been and are expected to continue to be seasonal
        historically our first fiscal quarter has been our weakest

       our products are complex and before buying them customers spend a great
        deal of time reviewing and testing them our customers evaluation and
        purchase cycles do not necessarily match our quarterly periods like
        many companies in the software industry in the past we have received a
        disproportionate volume of orders in the last week of a quarter in
        addition a large proportion of our business is attributable to our
        largest customers as a result if any order and especially a large
        order is delayed beyond the end of a fiscal period our orders and
        revenue for that period could be below our plan

       accounting rules determine when revenue is recognized on our product and
        service contracts and therefore impact how much revenue we will report
        in any given fiscal period the authoritative literature under which the
        company recognizes revenue has been and is expected to continue to be
        the subject of much interpretative guidance in general following the
        change to our license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 most
        orders for our products and services yield revenue over multiple
        quarters extending beyond the current fiscal year or upon completion
        of performance rather than at the time the contract is executed the
        specific terms agreed to with a customer may have the effect of
        requiring deferral or acceleration of revenue in whole or in part
        therefore for any given fiscal period it is possible for us to fall
        short in our revenue andor earnings plan even while orders and backlog
        remain on plan or conversely to meet our revenue andor earnings plan
        because of backlog and deferred revenue while orders are under plan

       in fiscal 2000 we modified the license and pricing structure for our
        software products twice we believe that the changes we made in august
        2000 the adoption of technology subscription licenses are producing
        benefits for both synopsys and our customers but it remains possible
        that customer reaction will be unfavorable or that the transition to
        the new structure will be disruptive to business in either case
        resulting in the deferral or loss of sales or that our planned mix of
        license types will not be achieved

        our industry is highly competitive the eda industry is highly
competitive we compete against other eda vendors and with customers
internally developed design tools and internal design capabilities for a share
of the overall eda budgets of our potential customers in general competition
is based on product quality and features postsale support price and as
discussed below the ability to offer a complete design flow our competitors
include companies that offer a broad range of products and services such as
cadence mentor and avant as well as companies including numerous startup
companies that offer products focused on a discrete phase of the integrated
circuit design process in certain situations synopsys competitors have been
offering aggressive discounts on certain of their products in particular
simulation and synthesis products as a result average prices for these
products may fall in order to compete successfully we must continue to enhance
our products and bring to market new products that address the needs of our
customers we also will have to expand our consulting services business the
failure to enhance existing products develop andor acquire new products or
expand our ability to offer consulting services could have a material adverse
effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

        technology advances and customer requirements continue to fuel a change
in the nature of competition among eda vendors increasingly eda companies
compete on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical
design products referred to as physical synthesis products rather than on
the basis of individual point tools performing a discrete phase of the design
process the need to offer physical synthesis products will become increasingly
important as ics grow more complex our main physical synthesis product was
fully released in june 2000 and has been well received by customers but we
still do not offer customers a complete design flow we are working on
completing our design flow although there is no guarantee that we will be able
to offer a competitive flow to customers the market for physical design tools
is dominated by cadence and avant both of which offer products linking logic
and physical design if we are unsuccessful in developing a complete design flow




                                                                              25
page   26
on a timely longterm debt basis or in convincing customers to adopt our
integrated logical and physical design products and methodology our competitive
position could be significantly weakened

        our revenue growth depends on new and nonsynthesis products
historically much of our growth has been attributable to the strength of our
logic synthesis products these products accounted for 35 of revenue in fiscal
2000 we believe that orders and revenues for our flagship logic synthesis
product design compiler peaked in fiscal 2000 therefore in order to meet our
revenue plan revenue from our physical synthesis products our nonsynthesis
products and professional services must grow faster than our overall revenue
growth target among the products that we expect to be the most important
contributors to revenue growth are our physical compiler physical synthesis vcs
verilog simulation and designware ip library products if revenue growth for
these products fails to meet our goals it is unlikely that we will meet our
overall revenue growth target

        in order to sustain revenue growth over the long term we will have to
introduce new products that are accepted by a broad range of customers and to
significantly expand our consulting services business product success is
difficult to predict the introduction of new products and growth of a market
for such products cannot be assured in the past we like all companies have
had products that have failed to meet our revenue expectations expanding
revenue from consulting services will require us to recruit hire and train a
large number of skilled employees and to implement management controls on
bidding and executing on consulting engagements the consulting business is
significantly different from the software business however and increasing
consulting orders and revenue while maintaining an adequate level of profit can
be difficult there can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding
revenue from existing or new products at the desired rate or in expanding our
services business and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect
on our business financial condition and results of operations

        businesses we acquire may not perform as projected we have acquired or
merged with a number of companies in recent years including epic design
technology inc viewlogic systems science inc everest gambit smartech
stanza apteq tsg and leda and as part of our efforts to increase revenue and
expand our product and services offerings we may acquire additional companies
in addition to direct costs acquisitions pose a number of risks including
potential dilution of earnings per share problems in integrating the acquired
products and employees into our business the failure to realize expected
synergies or cost savings the failure of acquired products to achieve projected
sales the drain on management time for acquisitionrelated activities adverse
effects on customer buying patterns and assumption of unknown liabilities while
we attempt to review proposed acquisitions carefully and negotiate terms that
are favorable to us there is no assurance that any acquisition will have a
positive effect on our performance

        our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics businesses
purchases of our products are largely dependent upon the commencement of new
design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the number
of design engineers and the increasing complexity of designs our business has
benefited from the rapid worldwide growth of the semiconductor industry though
we do not directly benefit from increased volume alone several semiconductor
manufacturers and vendors of products incorporating semiconductors have recently
announced earnings shortfalls and the outlook for the electronics industry and
the us economy as a whole is uncertain in addition demand may be affected
by mergers in the semiconductor and systems industries which may reduce the
aggregate level of purchases of our products and services by the combined
companies slower growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries a
reduced number of design starts tightening of customers operating budgets
continued consolidation among our customers or a shift toward fpgas or other
types of semiconductors that can be designed with lessexpensive eda software
all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition
and results of operations

        stagnation of international economies would adversely affect our
performance during fiscal 2000 42 of our revenue was derived from outside of
north america an increase from 34 in fiscal 1999 international revenue is
vulnerable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and in regional or
worldwide economic or political conditions it will be difficult to sustain our
overall growth rate without continued growth in revenue from japan asia pacific
and europe revenue from japan grew by almost 30 during fiscal 2000
notwithstanding a weak economy based in large part on the multiyear renewal of
licenses by a number of large customers we do not expect similar growth in
revenue from japan during fiscal 2001 if the japanese economy remains weak
revenue from japan and perhaps the rest of asia could be adversely affected
in addition the yendollar and eurodollar exchange rates remain subject to
unpredictable fluctuations weakness of the yen could adversely affect revenue
from japan during future quarters asian countries other than japan also have
experienced economic and currency problems and in most cases they have not
fully recovered if such conditions persist or worsen orders and revenues from
the asia pacific region would be adversely affected



                                                                              26

        our success depends on recruiting and retaining key personnel our
success is dependent on technical and other contributions of key employees we
participate in a dynamic industry with significant startup activity and our
headquarters is in silicon valley where skilled technical sales and management
employees are in high demand there are a limited number of qualified eda
engineers and the competition for such individuals is intense experience at
synopsys is highly valued in the eda industry and our employees are recruited
aggressively by our competitors and by startup companies our compensation
packages are competitive in the market but startup companies may be able to
offer more attractive stock option packages as a result we have experienced
and may continue to experience significant employee turnover there can be no
assurance that we can continue to recruit and retain the technical and
managerial personnel we need to run our business failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of
operations

        dependence on proprietary technology our success is dependent in part
upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights we rely
on contractual arrangements with customers employees and others and
intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary technology there can be
no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we would have
adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise
become known or be independently developed by competitors moreover effective
intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain
foreign countries failure to obtain or maintain appropriate patent copyright
or trade secret protection for any reason could have a material adverse effect
on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition
there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against
us and any such claims could require us to enter into royalty arrangements or
result in costly and timeconsuming litigation

        fixed operating expenses our operating expenses are based in part on
our expectations of future revenue and expense levels are generally committed
in advance of revenue since only a small portion of our expenses varies with
revenue a shortfall in revenue translates directly into a reduction in net
income for fiscal 2001 our target for overall expense growth over fiscal 2000
is 25 to 35 substantially below the rate of growth in recent years and we
have implemented expense controls to achieve this target if we are unsuccessful
in generating anticipated revenue or unsuccessful at controlling the growth of
expenses however our business financial condition and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected

        antitakeover provisions we have adopted a number of provisions that
could have antitakeover effects the board of directors has adopted a preferred
shares rights plan commonly referred to as a poison pill in addition the
board of directors has the authority without further action by its
stockholders to issue additional shares of common stock and to fix the rights
and preferences of and to issue authorized but undesignated shares of preferred
stock these and other provisions of synopsys restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have the
effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in
control or management of synopsys including transactions in which the
shareholders of the company might otherwise receive a premium for their shares
over then current market prices

        change in financial accounting standards we prepare our financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap
gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public
accountants aicpa the sec and various bodies appointed by these organizations
to interpret existing rules and create new accounting policies in particular a
task force of the accounting standards executive committee a subgroup of the
aicpa meets on a quarterly basis to review various issues arising under the
existing software revenue recognition rules and issues interpretations of these
rules additional interpretations issued by the task force may have an adverse
effect on how we report revenue or on the way we conduct our business in the
future
